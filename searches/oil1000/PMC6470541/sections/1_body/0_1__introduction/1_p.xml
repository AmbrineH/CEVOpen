<p class="p">In recent years, the worldwide capture of fish from fishing activities has exceeded 150 million tons [
 <xref rid="B1-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. From these, a huge amount of material (more than 25%, but in some cases up to 70%) is considered as by-product (skeletons, viscera, heads, etc.) after human food processing. These wastes must be well managed to avoid environmental problems and to try to maintain resource sustainability [
 <xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In addition to these large volumes, fish by-products that are generated through canning and freezing activities must be included, as well as the new fish discards biomasses that will be generated in fulfilling the main goals of the Landing Obligation of the European Commission (EU) Common Fisheries Policy [
 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. From 2019, the Landing Obligation will force all fishing vessels to keep and not discard all of the species that are caught that are subjected to quota or have a minimum legal size, as well as underutilized commercial species. That is why valorisation solutions have to be implemented to manage this new situation while using available and simple technological alternatives that do not have high associated operating costs [
