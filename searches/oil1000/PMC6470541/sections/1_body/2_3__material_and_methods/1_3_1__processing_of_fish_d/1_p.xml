<p class="p">The samples of grenadier (G, 
 <italic class="italic">Macrourus</italic> sp.), megrim (Me, 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidorhombus boscii</italic>), European hake (Ha, 
 <italic class="italic">Merluccius merluccius</italic>), boarfish (Bo, 
 <italic class="italic">Capros aper</italic>), and Atlantic horse mackerel (HM, 
 <italic class="italic">Trachurus trachurus</italic>) were caught in Atlantic North Ocean by Galician fishing fleets, classified as fish discards, and the death specimens were quickly preserved in ice. The species were immediately processed on the same day of being caught. Fish were manually gutted and headed, and the meat was mechanically separated from bones and skin using a bone separator (Baader 694, Germany). Fish mince was then processed to prepare fish frozen block according the protocol that was described in Blanco et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The percentages of heads (H) and skins with bones (SB) that were generated by fish discards processing were in the range of 23.7–53.8% and 3.9–23.5%, respectively.
