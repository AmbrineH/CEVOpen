At the end of the hydrolysis (4 h), the content of the reactors was filtered (100 μm) to remove bones, the liquid hydrolysates were centrifuged (15,000 g, 20 min) to recover oil (adding a step of decantation for 5 min), and the FPHs were quickly heated (90 °C, 15 min) for protease deactivation. Liquid fish peptones were obtained after the sterilisation (121 °C, 15 min) and centrifugation (15,000 g, 20 min) of FPHs (SBP: skin/bone peptone and HP: head peptone).
