<p class="p">SB from fish discards were treated for gelatin extraction using the methodology that was reported by Sousa et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-marinedrugs-17-00139" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. To summarize, the steps for gelatin recovery were: (1) aqueous wash of SB; (2) sequential chemical treatment of portions with NaOH 0.05 M, sulphuric acid 0.02 M, and citric acid 0.05 M solutions; (3) gelatin-water extraction at medium temperature; and, (4) cleaning and deodorization by active charcoal and oven drying of gelatin solutions. Gel strength of gelatins were quantified by texture analysis [
