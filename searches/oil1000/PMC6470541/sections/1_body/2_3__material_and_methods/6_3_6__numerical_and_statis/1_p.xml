<p class="p">Data fitting procedures and parametric estimations were conducted by the minimisation of the sum of quadratic differences between the observed and model-predicted values, using the non-linear least-squares (quasi-Newton) method that was provided by the macro ‘Solver’ of the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Confidence intervals from the parametric estimates (Student’s t test) and the consistence of mathematical models (Fisher’s F test) were evaluated by “SolverAid” macro.</p>
