<p class="p">Starting in 2019, large amounts of new biomasses from fish discards will be generated in European ports following the Landing Obligation guidelines that were issued by the European Commission. In this work, by-products from the mechanical production of fish block mince (heads and skin and bones) were processed to extract gelatin solutions and, by enzymatic proteolysis, oils, fish protein hydrolysates, including bioactive peptides, and fish peptones were produced. As an example of the peptones application, pediocin SA-1, lactic acid, and biomass from
