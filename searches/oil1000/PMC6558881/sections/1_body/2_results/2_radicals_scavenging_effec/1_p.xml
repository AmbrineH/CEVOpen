<p id="Par39" class="p">The effects of AISM from leaf and stem-bark EOs on the radical scavenging property of neem soaps (NMLS, NSBS, and NMLSBS), creams (NMC, NMLC, NMSBC and NMLSBC) as well as neem cosmetics (NMS and NMC) produced devoid of AISM were examined on three different radicals (DPPH •, LP •, and NO •). The radical scavenging effects of neem soaps and positive control (ascorbic acid and rutin) on the radicals were concentration dependent (Figs.
