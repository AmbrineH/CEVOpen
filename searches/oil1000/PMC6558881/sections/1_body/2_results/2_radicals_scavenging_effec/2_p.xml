<p id="Par40" class="p">A substance that offers one or more hydrogen atoms to a radical converting the latter a non- radical molecule is referred to as a radical scavenger. This activity is shown as the color of DPPH • turns to yellow from purple (DPPH • solution) of the investigated substance because of formation of a neutral molecule of DPPH-H upon donation of H atom from the substance [

We therefore quantitatively tested presumed and précised inhibitory efficiency of each neem product by employing two different specific types of radicals (nitric oxide and lipid peroxyl) associated with skin inflammation, blood diseases, and other oxidative stress-related ailments. Evaluating the IC

The neem cosmetics made without the AISM exhibited mild antioxidant capacity against nitric oxide, lipid peroxyl and DPPH radicals with IC50 values ranging between 4.78–6.50 and 6.10–10.42 mg/mL for the soaps and creams respectively. The cosmetics produced using AISM from the neem leaf and stem-bark EOs demonstrated the highest antioxidant efficacy against three distinct radicals with IC
