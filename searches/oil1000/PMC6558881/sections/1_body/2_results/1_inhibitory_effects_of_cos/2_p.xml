<p id="Par38" class="p">The four neem creams were generally less active against the seven pathogens compared to the neem soaps. Like the neem soaps, the neem creams produced with the AISM stem-bark and from both leaf and stem-bark EO (NMLSBC) had better effects against the pathogens (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). However, at 0.800 mg/mL on 
 <italic class="italic">E. cloacae</italic>, the four creams exhibited a similar effect, while NMLSBC displayed a superior MIC value (0.400 mg/mL). The NMLSBC displayed higher inhibitory effects than other neem cream products with lower MBC values against the five test pathogens, however, its effect was lower than that of positive control drug (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>).
