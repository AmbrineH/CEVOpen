<p id="Par37" class="p">The inhibitory effects (supporting document 1) of the neem cosmetics produced with and without AISM on test pathogens are as presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. The antibacterial activities of the neem soaps produced with AISM (NMLS, NMSBS, and NMLSBS) were significantly different (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from those without AISM (NMS) with MIC values ranging between 0.0125 to 0.400 mg/mL and 0.400 to 0.800 mg/mL respectively against the seven test pathogens. The NMS demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect on all test bacterial strains at 0.800 mg/mL, while the neem soap produced with AISM from the leaf EO (NMLS) was bactericidal against 
 <italic class="italic">E. cloacae, L. ivanovii, S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">V. paraheamolyticues</italic> at 0.400, 0.400, 0.800 and 0.800 mg/mL respectively. Unlike the NMS and NMLS, the neem soap made with AISM from the stem-bark EO (NMSBS) was bactericidal against all the test pathogens with MBC ranging between 0.100–0.800 mg/mL. The neem soap prepared using AISMs from both leaf and stem-bark EOs (NMLSBS) exhibited the highest antibacterial effects with MIC and MBC values of 0.0125 and 0.025 mg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">L. ivanovii</italic>, and 0.025 and 0.200 mg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">E. cloacae</italic>. Interestingly the NMLSBS and positive control (ciprofloxacin) had same MIC value against 
 <italic class="italic">L. ivanovii,</italic> while the MBC (0.025 mg/mL) was significantly better than control drug [ciprofloxacin (0.05 mg/mL)] as shown in Table
