<p id="Par41" class="p">The physicochemical properties (PCP) of the crude neem seed oil (NSO) and essential oils (EOs) extracted by mechanical cold press and hydrodistillation from the aerial parts respectively are as presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>. Except a lower iodine value (IV) of 77.47% obtained, the saponification, refractive index, and acid values of the NSO were similar to previous reports of neem seed oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] and some vegetable oils used for cosmetics making, especially soap [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, the IV in this present study was higher than the result obtained (63.81%) for neem seed oil grown in Sudan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. From Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>, it can be noticed that the relative density (RD) of the NSO and the two EOs is less than 1. However, the RD of the crude NSO (0.921) was significantly lower (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that reported for neem seed oil (0.939) by Akpan, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] and higher (0.905) than that obtained in India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. The RD values for EO from leaves (0.0902) and stem-bark (0.904) was significantly different p &lt; 0.05 from the crude NSO. The acid values of the EOs were found to be greater than NSO. Conversely, the ester, refractive indices and saponification values of the NSO were greater than that of leaf and stem-bark EOs.
