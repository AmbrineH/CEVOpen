<p id="Par44" class="p">The chemical profiles of secondary metabolites (SM) isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">A. indica</italic> leaf and stem-bark incorporated unto the recipes of neem cosmetics are as presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>. In this current study terpenes and oxygenated terpenes (terpenoids) that were the chief SM, efficiently boosted the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of neem cosmetics. Fifteen SMs were found in the LEO, while the SBEO contained 19 which represents 98.91 and 99.45% of the total SM content respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>). In the LEO, α-caryophyllene, γ-elemene and hexadecane were the major sesquiterpenes, accounting for 44.30% of the overall SM content, while the total monoterpenes, monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids SM were 22.70, 10.50 and 4.51% respectively. Conversely, in the SBEO there were fewer sesquiterpenes SM (24.21%) compared to the SM in the LEO. However, there were more sesquiterpenoids (23.70%) and monoterpenoids (19.80%) SM in SBEO. The presence of bioactive SMs including a diterpenoid (phytol 9.21%), curcumene (7.8%), camphene (3.0%), ledol (2.4%) and tetracosane (1.32%) in SBEO absent in LEO remarkably distinguished the chemical profile of the stem-bark EO from the leaf (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>). Furthermore, the yields of linalool oxide (15.2%), terpinene (13.7%), hexadecenoic acid (10.2%) and polyunsaturated linoleic acid (5.40%) were significantly higher in SBEO. This may corroborate the superior bioactive and physiochemical properties observed in neem stem-bark cosmetics products (NMSBEOS, NMLEOS-NMSBEOS, NMSBEOC, NMLEOC-NMSBEOC) in this study.
