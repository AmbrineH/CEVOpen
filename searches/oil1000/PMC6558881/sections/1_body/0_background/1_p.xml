<p id="Par22" class="p">The discovery of antibiotics created high hope for management for both infectious and non-communicable diseases, but these hopes have been decreased by the emergence of antibacterial resistant pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance has been listed as one of the top 3 threats to global public health [

 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, Vibrio Spp., and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) are known public threats in hospitals and have become more resistant because of natural selection processes, and over-prescription and misuse of antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. A novel curative agent is desirable which would have to be distinct from current classes of antibiotics to alleviate problems with cross-resistance and co-resistance of microbes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Pharmaceutical industries are unwilling to invest large sums of money into the development of new synthetic antibiotics due to high cost, time-consuming and because bacterial agents rapidly develop resistance no sooner than they were discovered. Studies in recent years have suggested that most secondary metabolites (SM) in essential oil (EO) has better properties and might stand as a substitute against certain pathogenic bacterial strains [
