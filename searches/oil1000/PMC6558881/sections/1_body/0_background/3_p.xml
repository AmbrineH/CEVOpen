 <italic class="italic">Azadirachta indica</italic> (Neem tree) is perhaps one of the most useful traditional medicinal plants especially in many tropical and subtropical countries. During the last three decades, apart from the chemistry of the neem essential oil compounds, considerable progress has been achieved on the organic and aqueous extracts biological activity as well as medicinal applications. The solvent extracts were reported to contain bioactive SM including nimbandiol, azadirachtin and nimbinin and natural steroids [

 <italic class="italic">A. indica</italic> secondary metabolites (AISM) from the seed oil, leaves and stem-bark EOs on neem products. Such study will unveil the chemistry and broadened the bioactivity knowledge of the plant extracts and amplify it utilizations against infections including ingrown nail, eczema, pimples and skin cancers. We aimed to investigate in vitro the inhibitory effects of soap and cream produced with the neem seeds oil and EOs against some selected infectious pathogens and oxidative stress radicals.
