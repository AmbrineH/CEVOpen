 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] was used for the determination of MIC and MBC of the neem cosmetics (NC). Under the aseptic condition, two-fold serial dilutions were carried in sterile microcentrifuge tubes in a total volume of 100 μL of Muller Hinton (MH) broth mixed with the NC of various concentrations ranging from 0.0125–0.800 mg/mL. The positive and negative controls were ciprofloxacin and water respectively, thereafter they were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The was assay carried in triplicate and tubes with the lowest concentration without visible growth were reported as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for each neem product and the control were determined by streaking out all tubes without visible growth in the MIC technique into fresh nutrient agar plates. Then, at 37 °C, the culture was incubated for 24 h. The lowest concentration of the cosmetics and ciprofloxacin that didn’t on the solid medium yield any growth after 24 h [
