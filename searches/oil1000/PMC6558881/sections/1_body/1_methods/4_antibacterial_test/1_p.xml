 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] were tested against the neem cosmetics (NC), following CLSI (2014) procedures. The bacterial suspensions were made by inoculating a fresh stock culture of the test bacteria strains into tubes containing 5 mL of sterile Luria Bertani broth and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, active cultures were grown 24 h in sterile Luria- Bertani broth inoculated into Mueller-Hinton Agar (MHA) incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, single colonies were transferred from MHA plates into 4 mL of normal saline solution determined spectrophotometrically at 580 nm as previously reported by Omoruyi et al. [
