Hemolytic test investigates hemoglobin discharge in the plasma (indicating red blood cell [RBC] lysis) due to contact with the test sample. Human RBC from one of our projects involving human blood was used in preparing blood agar plates (BAP). Wells were bored on the BAP at 0.10–0.70 mg / mL prepared in deionized water. Then, into each well 25 μL of the neem product was poured while BAP and well with only deionized water was used negative control. Thereafter, at 37 °C, the plates incubated for 24 h. The presence of hemolytic activity was examined on wells and the assay was carried in triplicate.
