The full boiled method was used to produce sample. Briefly, the weighed neem oil and shea butter (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) were warmed at 60 °C. The oil was filtered and poured into a 500 L beaker. Caustic soda solution (10% sodium hydroxide and 20% water) was added to the oil, stirred with a dried wooden stirrer for proper mixing. The mixture was heated, boiled and allowed to become slurry on continuous stirring. On cooling (34 
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> C), the slurry was divided into four equal weights, sodium silicate added to each and stirred properly. To the first part (NMS) no neem essential oil was added (as control), in the second part the extracted neem leaves EO was added (NMLEO), for the third part EO from stem-bark was added (NMSBEO), and the fourth contained both NMLEO and NMSBEO (1,1). Each slurry was separately stirred for proper mixing and left in a separate wooden mound to solidify. Thereafter, they were cut into smaller sizes and left at ambient temperature for 48 h prior to analysis.
