<p id="Par28" class="p">The neem cream was produced using varnishing base formulation by combining deionized water phase (DWP) and neem seed oil (NSO) as oil phase (OLP) with the use of the emulsifier as described by Hui [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Briefly, the OLP was prepared by combining all the waxes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and NSO in a microwavable container and heat until they are melted at 82.2 °C. The DWP was made by heating water separately to 75 °C, thereafter citric acid, methylparaben, and propylparaben were dissolved. The mixture then added to the OLP and blended thoroughly. On cooling (32 o C) it was divided into four equal weights in sterilized beakers. Subsequently, the 4 different neem cream samples (NMC, NMCL, NMCSB, and NMCLSB + NMCSB) were produced in a similar model as described four soap samples. They were kept in sterilized bottles at ambient temperature prior to analysis.
