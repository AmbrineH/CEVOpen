<p id="Par26" class="p">The physicochemical properties of the neem oil (NMO) and neem soap were performed using guidelines of AOAC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] and as described by Fatiany et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. (a) Acid value: The AV (mg/ KOH/g) of the NMO was evaluated by neutralizing the free acids by KOH; (b) Saponification value (SV): The SV (mg/ KOH/g) was calculated as the quantity of KOH necessary to saponify esters of acids and to neutralize the free acids in one gram of the NMO; (c) Ester index (EI): The EI was quantified as the difference between the SV and the AV. (d) Relative density (RD): The RD was measured with an Anton Paar GmbH dosimeter (DMA35N USA); (e) Refractive index (RI): The neem oil RI was measured at 38 °C with a digital refractometer (ATC95200–009 France). The physicochemical parameters (pH, moisture, total fatty matter, total free caustic alkali, unsaponifiable matter, matter insoluble in ethanol and water) of the neem soaps were carried out as described in Mak-Mensah et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>] report. The SM in the leaves EO (LEO) and stem-bark EO (SBEO) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and retention index (RI). The instrument used (Hewlett- Packed 5973 mass spectrometer linked with an HP 6890 gas chromatograph) was programmed as in our previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Thereafter, the identification each SM was carried out by the conformity of their mass spectra data (MSD) with the reference held in the computer library (Wiley 275, New York). Furthermore, the retention index (RI) of the SM was matched with those in literature, while the total percentage composition of SM in each EO was their peak areas.
