 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] was used to determine the NO• scavenging potential of the NC. At physiological pH 7.2, sodium nitroprusside nitric oxide decomposed generating NO• which react in the presence of O2 and resultant stable nitrite and nitrate is measured in Griess solution. Briefly, 1.0 mL of the NC at double fold concentrations (0.025–0.5 mg/mL prepared in DMSO) was added to 1.0 mL (10 mM) of sodium nitroprusside solution. The solution was incubated for 110 min at ambient temperature. Then followed the color development by adding 1.0 mL of the aliquot to Griess solution (1.0% N-naphthyl-ethylene diamine hydrochloride in 2.0% orthophosphoric acid and 1.0%, sulphanilamide). Thereafter, the absorbance of the color developed was then measured spectrophotometrically at 546 nm against the reagent blank. The scavenging effect (%) was then obtained using equation (a) described in DPPH radical test. The assay was carried out in parallel triplicate and the mean value calculated. The IC50 (mg/ mL) was obtained from the standard curve for each neem product and positive control in the three protocols. The lower the IC50 value the higher the antioxidant capacity.
