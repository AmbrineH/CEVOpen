<p id="Par33" class="p">The antioxidant potency of each NC and reference compound against the lipid peroxyl radical (LP •) were determined by the thiobarbituric acid assay as described in the previous report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] with a known lipid-rich source (egg yolk). Subsequently, at 532 nm the absorbance of the solution was read after aspirating the upper organic layer. The scavenging efficacy of each NC and RCs against lipid peroxyl at increasing concentrations (0.025–0.50 mg/mL) was assessed with the eq. (1) above.
