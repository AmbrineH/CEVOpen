 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>] on the variation of SM in EO plants parts, revealed that limonene and caryophyllene are the most SMs that contribute frequently for the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes biotransformation in EOs. This report supports the results we obtained as shown in the varied quantities of limonene and caryophyllene we found in the EOs; which might have transformed due to stress factors including temperature and pH. Study on SMs by Corma et al. [
