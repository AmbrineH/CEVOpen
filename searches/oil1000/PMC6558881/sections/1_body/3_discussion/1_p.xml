<p id="Par45" class="p">Biochemical investigations of inhibitory effects on pathogens and radicals of two different neem extracts (neem seed oil and EO) revealed higher bioactive and physicochemical properties of NC formulated with SM from the EO. Characterization of SM in the leaf and stem EOs integrated into the recipe of NC shown more terpenoids including phytol 18, one sesquiterpenoid (ledol 14), a monoterpene (camphene 2) and sesquiterpene (curcumene 8) in the stem-bark (SBEO). Moreover, the content of bioactive linoleic acid (17), hexadecenoic acid (15), caryophyllene oxide (12), linalool oxide (6) and terpinene (5) were more in SBEO. Accordingly, the NC made incorporating SMs from SBEO and LEO had the highest activity followed by NC produced with the SM from the SBEO, while NC produced with only crude neem seed oil (NSO) displayed the least activity. To the best of our knowledge, this enhanced bioactivity of neem cosmetics formulated from the leaves and stem bark of 
 <italic class="italic">A. indica</italic> SMs are reported here for the first time in the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Azadirachta</italic>. The neem cosmetics produced with AISM were more active against Gram-positive bacterial than the test Gram-negative bacterial strains. This may be linked to net repulsion of the complex outer membrane in Gram-negative bacterial, reported in previous studies to contain hydrophilic lipopolysaccharide which exhibits higher tolerance toward hydrophobic terpenes and oxygenated terpenes [
