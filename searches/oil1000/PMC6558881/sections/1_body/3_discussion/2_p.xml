<p id="Par46" class="p">Phytol one of the major SM in the SBEO was reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] to demonstrate good antioxidant effects in vivo and has a high capacity to quench hydroxyl and nitric oxide radicals as well as prevent the formation of lipid peroxides analyzed via thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Phytol may have possibly reacted with nitric oxide, lipid, DPPH radicals, and the seven test bacterial strains via various mechanisms suggested by Mortein et al. and Foti and Amorati [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. In addition, terpinene a major SM we found in SBEO of 
 <italic class="italic">A. indica</italic> is known to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation even in the early phase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Other bioactive SMs in EO profile including camphene [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>] and linoleic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] may have heightened the anti-oxidation and inhibition effects of the NC on radicals and the test pathogens.
