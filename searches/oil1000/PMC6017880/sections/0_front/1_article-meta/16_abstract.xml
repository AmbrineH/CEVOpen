 <p class="p">Phytochemical characters were evaluated in a five-year-old lemon balm collection consisting of 15 and 13 subspecies 
  <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">altissima</italic> accessions, respectively. Stems were lower in essential oil than leaves. First cut leaves (June) gave more oil than those of the second cut (August). Subspecies 
  <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> plants had leaf oils rich in geranial, neral and citronellal in various proportions in the first cut. However, in the second cut the oils from all accessions appeared very similar with 80–90% geranial plus neral. Leaf oils of subsp. 
  <italic class="italic">altissima</italic> contained sesquiterpenes (β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, germacrene D) and also further monoterpenes in the second cut. Leaves had higher rosmarinic acid (RA) contents than stems. More RA was in subsp. 
  <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> than subsp. 
  <italic class="italic">altissima</italic> leaves. First cut leaves were richer in RA than those from second cut. Total phenolics and antioxidant parameters showed that lemon balm is a valuable source of plant antioxidants.
