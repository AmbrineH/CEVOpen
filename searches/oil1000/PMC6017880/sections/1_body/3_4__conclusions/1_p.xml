<p class="p">Both lemon balm subspecies can clearly be differentiated by the composition of their essential oils. The MALT leaf oils showed higher variation than those of MOFF. Comparing the two cuts, the oil production displayed a remarkable plasticity. The oil composition of MOFF plants shifted from citronellal, geranial and neral in variable proportion in the first cut to geranial and neral in an approximate ratio of 1.47 and representing 80â€“90% of the respective oils. In contrast, MALT plants had oils with sesquiterpenes in the first cut that were augmented by sabinene and the pinenes in the second cut. In the leaves, the lowest and highest rosmarinic acid contents differed approximately by the factor three with a corresponding variability in total phenolics and antioxidant activity. This plasticity might be the base for the selection of lines and optimization of cultivation to obtain highly valuable plants high in rosmarinic acid and citrus-like aroma aldehydes.</p>
