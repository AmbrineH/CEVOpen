<p class="p">The dendrogram from HCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00294-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) presents two distinct main clusters, the left containing all accessions of MOFF while the right grouped the samples MALT. Plants of MOFF had the monoterpene aldehydes geranial (=
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-citral, citral a) and neral (=
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>-citral, citral b) with citrus-like aroma as major oil compounds, while in MALT the sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and germacrene D were characteristic compounds. The oils of the MALT leaves contained also appreciable amounts of the monoterpenes α-pinene, β-pinene and sabinene. Starting with 21 variables, the PCA calculated four components having eigenvalues greater than one and representing together 83.9% of total variance. The first axis accounted for 43.5% and the second for 21.5% of the variance (
