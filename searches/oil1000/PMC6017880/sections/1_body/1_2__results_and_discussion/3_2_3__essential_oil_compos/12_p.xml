<p class="p">Besides genetic factors such as the existence of the two subspecies, the basis of this observed high variability remains complex: There is the experience of the present study that second MOFF leaf oils had a highly uniform composition with little varying neral and geranial contents in contrast to the oils from the first cut of the same plants. Similarly, plants cultivated in Poland had in two consecutive years nearly the same geranial (45%) and neral (33%) contents in their oils while the citronellal content varied (0.4â€“8.7%) [
