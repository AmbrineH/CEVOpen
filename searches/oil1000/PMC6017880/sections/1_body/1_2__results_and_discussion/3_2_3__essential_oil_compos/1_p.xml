<p class="p">In leaves and stems 65 and 43 essential oil compounds could be identified, respectively. The detailed listing is available with the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00294" class="xref">Supporting Information Tables S2 and S3</xref>. Bar charts showing the main oil compounds of the accessions are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00294" class="xref">Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information</xref>. To study the complex oil patterns in the leaves a multivariate approach has been attempted using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) with selected essential oil compounds as variables and the accessions as cases. In PCA also rosmarinic acid, total phenolics and antioxidant activity of both cuts have been included as variables.
