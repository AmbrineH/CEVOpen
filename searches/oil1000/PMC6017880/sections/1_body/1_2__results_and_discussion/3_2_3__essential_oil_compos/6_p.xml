<p class="p">To summarize, the individual oil compounds loadings on the principal components are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00294-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The loading on component 1 shows as mentioned above a strong differentiation of the citrus-like aroma monoterpenes from both cuts (citronellal, neral, geranial) typical for MOFF oils from the sesquiterpenes that are characteristic for MALT. Here these monoterpenes were strongly associated with negative values while the mentioned sesquiterpenes loaded with positive values. Further monoterpenes α-pinene, β-pinene and sabinene which were conspicuous in MALT leaves of the second cut had positive loadings on component 1 and negative loadings on component 2. These three monoterpenes, almost absent in MOFF, were present in low amounts in several first cut MALT samples. Of the latter, only accession 
 <italic class="italic">M21</italic> had at this time 12.6% sabinene, 10.8% β-pinene and 4.5% α-pinene. However, in the second cut the accessions 
 <italic class="italic">M17</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M21</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M22</italic> were rich in these three compounds that together made up 55–60% of the respective oils. In consequence, they formed a subgroup with negative factor 2 scores in PCA and a distinct subcluster in HCA.
