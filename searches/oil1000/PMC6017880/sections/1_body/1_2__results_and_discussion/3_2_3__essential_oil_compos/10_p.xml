<p class="p">In sum, lemon balm essential oils show a great variability and plasticity. Literature references in most cases do not differentiate into the two subspecies when referring to essential oil composition but a great variation is documented. There are reports of oils having geranial and neral as main compounds. Leaf oil from plants grown in Algeria, being composed of 44.2% geranial, 30.2% neral, 6.3% citronellal and less than 4% sesquiterpenes, was similar to the present leaf oils from the second cut [
