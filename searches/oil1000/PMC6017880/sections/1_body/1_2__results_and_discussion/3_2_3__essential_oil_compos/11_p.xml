<p class="p">Greek lemon balm leaf oils with α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and germacrene D as reported by Basta et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] were therefore presumed to derive from subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">altissima</italic>. A leaf oil from Jordan having as main compound caryophyllene oxide (43.6%) reportedly also contained considerable amounts of γ-muurolene (28.8%) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In this case a confusion of this latter compound with germacrene D appears probable, as both components have similar retention behavior and fragmentation patterns in GC/MS. In some oils these citrus aroma monoterpenes occur along with comparable amounts of sesquiterpenes as in the case of a Moroccon leaf oil with 14.4% citronellal, 10.2% geranyl acetate, 5.2% nerylacetate, 11.0% caryophyllene oxide and 8.2% β-caryophyllene [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] but also in various lemon balm strains from Poland [
