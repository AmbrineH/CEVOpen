<p class="p">Stem essential oils were analyzed from five selected accessions of each subspecies (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00294" class="xref">Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4</xref>). Like in the leaves, the stem oils of the first cut MOFF plants had geranial, neral and citronellal in varying proportions but not more than 35% together, so these oils had a high proportion of sesquiterpenes such as β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and α-copaene. The latter reached 18% of the oil in accession 
 <italic class="italic">M10</italic>. In the second cut, the stems had as the leaves geranial and neral as main oil compounds, ranging together between 40% and 85% of the respective oils. In contrast, germacrene D that played only a marginal role in MOFF stems was a major compound in MALT stem oils. In the oil from the first cut of accession 
 <italic class="italic">M21</italic> it was the only detectable compound. Other sesquiterpenes present were caryophyllene oxide and β-caryophyllene and in accessions 
 <italic class="italic">M12</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M20</italic> also α-copaene. Stems of the first cut had more caryophyllene oxide and less β-caryophyllene than the respective stems of the second cut. The accessions 
 <italic class="italic">M17</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M21</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M22</italic>, having high proportions of β-pinene, sabinene and α-pinene in the leaves, had these compounds also in their stem oils from the second cut. By this way the stem oils reported here differed clearly from a stem oil of Iranian plants where the main constituents were: 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid (47.4%), (
 <italic class="italic">Z,Z</italic>)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid (14.9%), dodecanoic acid (4.6%), β-caryophyllene (4.2%) and geraniol (2.2%) [
