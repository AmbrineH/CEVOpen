<p class="p">In the present MOFF leaf oils geranial and neral were positively correlated (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = 0.976, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) but negatively correlated with citronellal (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.920 and −0.935, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Additionally, geranial and neral were negatively correlated with caryophyllene oxide, germacrene D and β-caryophyllene while caryophyllene oxide showed a positive correlation with citronellal and germacrene D. In MALT leaf oils α-pinene, β-pinene and sabinene were strongly correlated (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = 0.993–0.998, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) while caryophylene oxide was negatively correlated with these three monoterpenes (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.728 to −0.756, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and with germacrene D (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.521, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.008) and β-caryophyllenene (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.439, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.028). Small amounts of the sesquiterpenes α-copaene, β-cubebene and cadinol occured in samples from both subspecies and were usually higher in MALT.
