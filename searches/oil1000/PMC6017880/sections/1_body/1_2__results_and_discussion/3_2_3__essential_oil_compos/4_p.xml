<p class="p">In the dendrogram the first and the second cut samples of MOFF were classed into two distinct subclusters. The plants from the first cut had geranial as main compound, varying amounts of neral and citronellal and around 9% caryophyllene oxide in their oils. To compare, an oil from cultivated blooming plants of the Balkans with 23.4% geranial, 16.5% neral and 13.7% citronellal showed a similar composition as the present first cut oils [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and similar oils were also reported from blooming Slovakian plants [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, the oils from the present study second cut appeared more homogeneous: in each of 15 accessions geranial and neral accounted together for 80–90% of the oil and the variability between the accessions of these two compounds with coefficients of variation (CV%) of 5.1% and 4.2%, respectively, was remarkably low. A similar result was obtained by Adzet et al. (1992) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] where in 25 biotypes of lemon balm cultivated in the Spanish Ebro region the sum geranial + neral made up 93–96% of the respective oils with CV% less than 7%. In contrast to our results, in this latter study the ratio of these two compounds varied little between July/August and November [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Accession 
 <italic class="italic">M10</italic> had already in the first cut oil very high geranial and neral levels like the oils from the second cut and was therefore in the subcluster of the second cut samples. In comparison with other MOFF samples the first cut from 
 <italic class="italic">M8</italic> had the lowest geranial and neral and the highest β-caryophyllene and germacrene D percentages and had in consequence its distinct position in the dendrogram and on the score plot.
