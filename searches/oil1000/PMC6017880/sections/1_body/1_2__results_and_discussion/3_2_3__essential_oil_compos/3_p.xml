 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00294-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) show for MOFF samples a lower variability than for MALT samples. In addition, in both subspecies, the oil compositions changed noticeably from the first to the second cut. In PCA first cut samples were mostly associated with a positives component 2 score while the second cut samples had rather a respective negative score (
