<p class="p">Again, the leaves were richer in total phenolics than the stems. For the leaves the values ranged between 47.3 and 104.2 mg/g, but the mean contents of the accessions between cuts or the subspecies were not significantly different. For the stems total phenolic contents were between 26.7 and 57.6 mg/g with markedly lower contents in the MALT samples (

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and were thereby comparable to the contents observed in the present study. With 98.5 mg/g caffeic acid equivalents, lemon balm leaves from Greece were in the same range [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. By relating the HPLC data with the colorimetric rosmarinic acid equivalent data the percentage of rosmarinic acid in the total phenolics was calculated. For the leaves the mean proportion of rosmarinic acid was between 73.8% and 85.8%. In stems this percentage was lower, ranging from 45.9% to 69.4%, so rosmarinic acid was the major polyphenolic compound. Infusions of various lemon balm leaves gave on average 21.9 mg/g rosmarinic acid [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. A hydro-alcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Melissa</italic> gave about 29.7 mg/g rosmarinic acid [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Carnat et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported 4.1% rosmarinic acid in lemon balm leaves. In the chromatograms of the present study several further peaks were present besides rosmarinic acid but they were not further identified. Literature reports mention various polyphenolic compounds for lemon balm leaves and rosmarinic acid was often not a major compound. Lyophilized ethanolic extracts contained rutin as major flavonoid with 9.26%, followed by quercetin (4.13%), quercitrin (3.59%) and isoquercitrin (2.35%). Amongst phenolic acids, the most prevalent was caffeic acid with 6.42%, followed by ellagic (4.85%) and gallic acid (3.76%). In this study, rosmarinic acid was only a minor compound (2.2%) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Another study reported sinapic and ferulic acid along with rosmarinic acid as main compounds [
