<p class="p">Like other species from the Lamiaceae lemon balm is rich in polyphenols. Therefore, total phenolics have been estimated by the colorimetric Folin-Ciocalteu- assay and rosmarinic acid has been determined by HPLC in ethanolic extracts of the samples. Rosmarinic acid contents (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00294-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) ranged from 26.3 to 90.1 mg/g in the leaves and from 14.1 to 38.3 mg/g in the stems. The Pharmacopoeia Europaea [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] prescribes at least 1% of rosmarinic acid in the dried leaves. This requirement was met by all leaf samples. MOFF leaves had more rosmarinic acid than those of MALT (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.038) and rosmarinic acid was higher in the leaves from the first cut as compared to the second cut (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.020). Furthermore, in MALT leaf oils rosmarinic acid was positively correlated (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 25) with caryophyllene oxide (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = 0.423, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.035) and negatively correlated with sabinene (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.667, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), α-pinene (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.649, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and β-pinene (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.634, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001). An overview of total phenolics content expressed as rosmarinic acid equivalents per g dry matter is given in
