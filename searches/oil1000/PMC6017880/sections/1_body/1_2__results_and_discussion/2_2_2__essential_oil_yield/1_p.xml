<p class="p">The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and recovered in hexane. Some samples very low in oil did not allow a direct reading of the oil content in the distillation apparatus. Therefore, the oil content of all samples was calculated from the total area of all peaks in Gas chromatography/flame ionization detection (GC/FID) assuming the same response as for the internal standard cyclododecanone (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00294-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The oil content of the leaves proved to be very variable: Plants of MOFF had higher oil content than those of MALT (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004 and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for the first and second cut, respectively). The exact values are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00294" class="xref">Table S1 in the Supporting Information</xref>. At the same time leaves contained more essential oil than stems. Furthermore, crop management appeared to have an important influence on essential oil accumulation as the regrowth harvested at the second cut had considerably higher oil contents as compared to the first cut. During plant development the highest oil contents occur with around 0.4% in the herb during the flowering stage, while large variation may occur from one year to another [
