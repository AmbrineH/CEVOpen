 <xref rid="molecules-23-00294-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) gave higher values for the leaves (72.1–190.9 mg/g Trolox equivalents) than for the stems (14.9–93.1 mg/g Trolox equivalents). In this case the stems of the second cut had the lower levels than those of the first (

When correlating rosmarinic acid, total phenolics, DPPH and FRAP antioxidant activity with each other in all cases highly significant correlations could be obtained. The correlation coefficients for the six possible combinations ranged between 0.901 and 0.941 with
