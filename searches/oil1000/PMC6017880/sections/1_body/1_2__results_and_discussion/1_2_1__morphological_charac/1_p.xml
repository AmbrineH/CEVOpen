<p class="p">Altogether, 28 accessions were evaluated, 15 belonging to MOFF (
 <italic class="italic">M1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M4–M8</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M10</italic>,

 <italic class="italic">M13</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M16</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M25–M27</italic>,

 <italic class="italic">M9</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M12</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M14</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M15</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M17–M24</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M28</italic>). Accession 
 <italic class="italic">M3</italic> had to be excluded from the study as no plant material was available. The variability of simple morphological traits as shoot development and leaf sizes has been recorded in the second year of growth and both subspecies were compared as presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00294-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Significant differences were found for the characters shoot length (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002), distance of nodes (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the ratio leaf length/width (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.015). Thus, on average plants of MALT had longer shoots and spaces between nodes but a lower leaf length to width ratio, and their leaves appeared more orbicular.
