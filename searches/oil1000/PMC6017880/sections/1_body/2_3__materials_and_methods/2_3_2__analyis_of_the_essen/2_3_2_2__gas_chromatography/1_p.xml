<p class="p">The analyses were carried out on an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a 5975 C quadrupole mass selective detector, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a CTC-PAL autosampler (Agilent Technolgies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The separation was done on a 30 m × 0.25 mm fused silica column coated with 0.25 µm HP5-MS. The compounds eluting from the column were distributed with a Deans switch at equal proportions to the detector of the mass spectrometer (MSD) and FID. The temperature program of the oven was: isotherm at 50 °C for 1 min then increasing to 220 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and increasing further to 280 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min. The split of the injector was set at 1:30. The injection volume was 1 µL. The total ion current (

As a range of accessions had very low oil contents, so that the oil amount could not be read at the distillation unit, the oil content was estimated through the total peak area assuming the same response as the internal standard.
