<p class="p">About 15 g of dried plant material were hydrodistilled with 400 mL double distilled water in a Clevenger type apparatus for 1.5 h. As the plant material contained low oil amounts, 1.0 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane was added into the apparatus to collect the volatile oils. All accessions were distilled twice and therefore also analyzed twice. The collected volatile fractions were stored at −18 °C until further GC and GC-MS analysis. Prior to analysis cyclododecanone in hexane was added to the samples as an internal standard.
