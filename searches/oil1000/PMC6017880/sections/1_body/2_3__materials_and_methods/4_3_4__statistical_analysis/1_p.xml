<p class="p">The statistical analyses were done with the package IBM SPSS for Windows, version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) using the squared Euclidian distance with linkage between groups was carried out for each subspecies to group the accessions according to the composition of their leaf essential oils from both cuts, considering the percentages of 17 oil compounds. Furthermore, the complex interplay of major essential oil compounds was studied by principal component analysis (PCA). The percentages of 17 essential oil compounds, DPPH and FRAP as trolox-equivalents, total phenolics as rosmarinic acid equivalents and rosmarinic acid (mg/g DM) have been used as variables (see the legend of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00294-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The leaf samples from both cuts were the cases. The software performed a Z-transformation before calculating the loadings of the variables and scores of the samples. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between selected essential oil components and rosmarinic acid. One-way analysis of variance was applied to evaluate differences in rosmarinic acid contents and antioxidant parameters.
