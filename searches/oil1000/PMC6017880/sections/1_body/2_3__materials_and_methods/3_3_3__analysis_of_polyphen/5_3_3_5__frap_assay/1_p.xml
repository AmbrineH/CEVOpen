<p class="p">The principle is based on the ability of antioxidants to reduce ferric (Fe

In the microplate wells 9 µL sample, 15 µL aqua dest. and 180 µL working reagent were mixed and measured after 5 min at 595 nm. The working reagent consisted of 25 mL acetic acid buffer (300 mmol/L), pH 3.6, 2.5 mL 10 mmol/L TPTZ in 40 mmol/L HCl and 2.5 mL FeCl
