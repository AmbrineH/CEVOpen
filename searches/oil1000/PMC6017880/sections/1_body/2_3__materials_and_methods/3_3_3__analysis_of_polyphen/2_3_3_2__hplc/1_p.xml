<p class="p">The content of rosmarinic acid was measured according to Chizzola et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-00294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] using a Waters HPLC system consisting of a 626 pump, a 600S controller, a 717plus autosampler, a column oven operated at 25 °C, and a 996 diode array detector (Waters S.A.S, Saint-Quentin, France). The separation was carried out on a Symmetry C18, 5.0 μm particle size, 4.6 × 150 mm column. The mobile phase used was 1% acetic acid/acetontrile 85:15 (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B). The analysis started with a solvent ratio of A/B of 9:1, and a linear gradient was performed to reach 100% B within 30 min. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the injection volume, 20 μL.
