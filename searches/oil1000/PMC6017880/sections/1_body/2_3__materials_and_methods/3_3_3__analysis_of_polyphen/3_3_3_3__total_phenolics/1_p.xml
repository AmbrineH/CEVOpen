<p class="p">This fraction was assayed with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. In the wells of the microplate 10 µL extracts was added to 100 µL aqua dest. followed by 5 µL Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, 10 µL Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (35% in aqua dest.) and again 125 µL aqua dest. After 1 h resting in the dark the plate is measured at 750 nm. To calibrate the color formation six concentration steps (ranging from 0.4 to 4.0 µg rosmarinic acid in 110 µL were taken instead the sample and the initial water volume.
