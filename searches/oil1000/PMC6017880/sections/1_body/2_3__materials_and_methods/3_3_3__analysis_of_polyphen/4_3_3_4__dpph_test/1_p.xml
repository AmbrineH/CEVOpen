<p class="p">Antioxidants react with the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) which is then decolorized. A portion of the sample (5–25 µL) made up to 100 µL methanol were incubated for 30 min in the dark with 100 µL DPPH reagent (0.015% in methanol) in the microplate wells. Increasing volumes (0–8 µL) of Trolox (0.62 mg/mL in ethanol) made up to 100 µL with methanol instead of the samples were used to obtain a calibration curve. A preparation consisting of 50 µL trolox, 50 µL aqua dest. and 100 µL DPPH reagent where the DPPH was completely decolorized was taken as blank and subtracted from all measurements. The decoloration was measured at 490 nm.</p>
