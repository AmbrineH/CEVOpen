<p class="p">The cholesterol content in eggs yolk is species-related: Limiting the comparison to table eggs, quail eggs contain 11.4% more cholesterol (on average 390 mg/100 g whole egg) than dark-shell hen eggs (350 mg/100 g whole egg) [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Cholesterol values observed in the present experiment for quail eggs (on average 473 mg/100 g whole egg) were even higher, having 35% more cholesterol than the dark-shell hen eggs of the above-mentioned study. The cholesterol content is primarily regulated endogenously (de novo synthesis) and scarcely dependent on the dietary treatment [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Results of the present study agreed with this, as the dietary cholesterol provided to laying quails due to the incorporation of BSF larva meal did not modify the egg cholesterol content.
