<p class="p">The sensory profile of eggs is surely a relevant aspect that must be considered when testing a novel feed ingredient in layers’ diets, as it demonstrated to be either negatively, positively or neutrally affected: Previous researches showed that the inclusion of fish silage [

 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] in laying hens’ diets negatively affected some sensory traits of the eggs. Also, when turmeric was fed to laying quails some negative effects on yolk appearance were observed, but aroma and flavor were overall acceptable [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In literature the only other research study testing the effect of a dietary inclusion of defatted BSF larvae meal in layers’ diets on the sensory profile of the derived eggs, observed an improvement the appearance, texture, and taste of eggs derived from insects-fed birds (5% dietary inclusion), positively affecting the overall product acceptability [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Sensory improvements were attributable to the high glutamic acid content of the insect meal. The present defatted BSF larva meal was previously also tested in the diets for broiler quails at the same inclusion levels of the present study [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], but no differences in the sensory profile of the meat were observed. Analogously, in the present study the sensory traits of eggs derived from defatted BSF larva meal-fed quails were comparable with those obtained for quails fed the conventional diet. The latter result is extremely important in the perspective of a successful practical application of this new feed ingredient into dietary formulations for laying quails.
