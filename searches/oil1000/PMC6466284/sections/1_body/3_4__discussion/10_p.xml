 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]; despite this, the FA profile of this insect species is intrinsically characterized by a greatest proportion of SFA, which can account for the 75% of total FA, with C12:0 (lauric), C14:0 (myristic) and C16:0 (palmitic) acids being the main contributors. Moreover, this insect species has a limited proportion of MUFA (&lt;10% of total FA) and PUFA (&lt;15% of total FA), with C18:1

However, compared to the linear effect exerted by the FA composition of the defatted BSF larvae meal on the FA profile of quail and chicken meat [
