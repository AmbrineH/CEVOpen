<p class="p">To a great increase in the C12:0 content of the diets due to the inclusion of defatted BSF larva meal (+134%), the increase in the eggs did not show the same magnitude (+8%). On the other hand, to the relatively small dietary contents of palmitic acid (12.3% of total FA) and C18:0 (stearic acid; 5.67% of total FA), it was observed a double and more than 4-fold contents of C16:0 and C18:0 in the yolk, respectively. Results of the present research, in this sense, agreed with those by Secci et al. [
