<p class="p">The proximate composition of quail eggs of the present study was in line with existing data about this avian species [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The observed difference in terms of protein content in BSF15 eggs compared to the Control ones was not attributable the protein content of the experimental diets as it was similar, being 194 and 195 g/kg in the two feeds, respectively. Therefore, to explain such finding it was hypothesized a lower protein availability, due to the chitin content of the diets which increased with the defatted BSF larvae meal inclusion level. Chitin, which is a polysaccharide constituting insect exoskeleton, is known to exert a negative effect on nutrient digestion, included the protein fraction which was observed also in the work by Cullere et al. [

 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], as they observed no effect of a 100% dietary substitution of soybean meal with BSF larva meal in the diets for laying hens on the egg proximate composition.
