<p class="p">Ensuring or improving the quality of the eggshell of laying poultry species is of great interest because a good eggshell quality prevents the economic losses due to cracking or damaging phenomena. In this sense, physical parameters such as shell thickness, shell weight and egg shape index play a major role [

 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Despite the inclusion of defatted BSF larva meal increasing the egg shape index, results were in line with values reported for this bird species [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and close to the optimal range 72–76% indicated for hens’ eggs [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Results of the present study for which eggs with a higher shape index had also a higher shell weight, agreed with the results of Yilmaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], and were a positive correlation between egg shape index and shell weight that was observed.
