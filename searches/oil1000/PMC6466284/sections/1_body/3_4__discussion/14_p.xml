<p class="p">The pH values recorded during the storage trial on quails’ eggs were slightly lower than values presented by Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This finding was not surprising as albumen pH gives a clear indication of the freshness of the egg and, in the present experiment, pH measurement was conducted the day after the eggs were laid. The observed increase in the albumen pH after 28 days of storage, which was independent to the dietary treatment, is the natural consequence of the loss of carbon dioxide during storage, and the breaking down of the ovomucin-lysozyme complex [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Literature data show that the supplementation of antioxidants-rich herbs or extracts from herbs during the laying period reduce eggs susceptibility to oxidative phenomena, thus offering the potential to increase the oxidative stability of poultry products [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The effect of a dietary supplementation with insect meal on the oxidative stability of the eggs has not been investigated yet, thus results of the present research are the first ones in this sense. Results of the present research agreed with those of Yesilbag et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] where, despite the first day of storage MDA values didn’t differ among treatments, a dietary inclusion with rosemary and oregano oils lowered the MDA content of the quail eggs’ yolk during the refrigerated storage. Our finding in this sense could depend on two different aspects: As it was pointed out by other studies [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], the BSF larva contain carotenoids which are known for their antioxidant activity, which was however not assessed in the present study. On another hand, the defatted BSF larva meal is a source of SFA which determined a progressive lowering in the FA peroxidability index compared to the Control group, thus lowering the susceptibility to oxidative phenomena. Despite this, the observed lower MDA content in the BSF10 yolk, but not those of the BSF15 group compared to the Control yolks, was not expected and requires further investigation.
