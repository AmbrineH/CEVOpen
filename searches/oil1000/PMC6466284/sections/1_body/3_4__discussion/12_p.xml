<p class="p">The dietary content of linoleic acid and C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 (α-linolenic) acid in poultry diets is very important as they are essential precursors of longer 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA, though synthesis catalyzed by enzyme complexes, including Δ5 and Δ6-desaturases and elongases [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. This was highlighted by the results of our study where laying quails produced eggs containing C20:4 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 (arachidonic), C20:5 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 (eicosapentaenoic; EPA) and C22:6 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 (docosaesaenoic; DHA) acids, even if diets had extremely low or no contents of such FA. In this sense, the capability of quails to enrich arachidonic acid and DHA contents in the egg yolk is documented [
 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. As expected, the lower content of the essential precursors in the diet with increasing inclusion levels of defatted BSF larvae meal were the reason behind the lower content of the precursors themselves, but also of their derivatives, in the egg yolk.
