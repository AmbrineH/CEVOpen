<p class="p">Results of the present research contrast with the previous cited paper also regarding the ash content of the eggs: In the present study ash augmented with increasing the dietary inclusion level of BSF larva meal, whereas in the above-mentioned research ash content was unaffected by the dietary treatment. A hypothesis to explain the present finding was that the BSF larva meal could have provided a dietary mineral enrichment thanks to the high content in Ca, P, K and Mg [
