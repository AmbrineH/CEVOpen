 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] in Lohmann Selected Leghorn layers fed defatted BSF larva meal (crude protein: 59.0%; crude fat: 11.0%) replacing the 50% or 100% of soybean cake (3-week feeding experiment), as no effect due to the dietary treatment was observed on hensâ€™ live weight, mortality, egg production, feed intake, egg weight. Differently, another study testing a defatted BSF larva meal (crude protein: 61.3%; crude fat: 4.61%) as a complete replacement of soybean meal in the diets for Lohmann Brown Classic laying hens, highlighted a reduction in feed intake which negatively affected final body weight, laying percentage and egg weight [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The visual system is well developed in poultry species: It has been reported that they can discriminate feeds with different colorimetric characteristics, that they tend to prefer the feed whose color is similar to the diet fed after hatching, and that colored diets can determine a reduction in feed intake [

Despite the biological bases of color preferences in Japanese quail not completely being understood yet, it is accepted that color vision is a predominant aspect in feed choice for them, and that color preferences can be modified by learning and selective breeding [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The fact that the defatted BSF larvae meal used in the present trial did not determine a significant change in the final color of the feed, could explain why productive performance of laying quails were not affected, differently from what was observed in the above-mentioned study. Like our findings, no different feed intake related to the use of defatted BSF larva meal in the diet for different strains of laying hens was observed in the experiment by Al-Qazzaz et al. [
