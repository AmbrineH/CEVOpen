<p class="p">Feeding increasing levels of defatted BSF larvae meal to layer quails intensified yolk color, which was in line with the observation of Secci et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] on eggs derived from laying hens fed with a 100% dietary substitution of soybean meal with defatted BSF larva meal. On the one hand this result could have been due to the higher maize content of the feed included with the BSF larva meal in both experiments. On the other hand, in the above-mentioned study the increase in yolk redness was justified by the total carotenoid content of the insect meal, which enhanced also the total carotenoid content of the egg yolk. Existing research showed that the BSF larvae can contain 2.00â€“2.15 mg carotenoids/kg [

 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], but the effect of a dietary supplementation of BSF larva meal in laying birds on the pigment content of the egg is limited to the above-mentioned study by Secci et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], thus highlighting that further efforts to elucidate this aspect are needed, as it could have important market implications. In fact, carotenoids are important pigments that provide attractive color to egg yolk, which is a desirable visual characteristic, and the use of natural sources instead of synthetic ones is certainly more and more appreciated by modern consumers [
 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Furthermore, carotenoids are well known antioxidants thanks to their ability to quench singlet oxygen and trap peroxyl radicals, as well as playing a role in improving the health status of humans though preventing cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other chronic diseases [
