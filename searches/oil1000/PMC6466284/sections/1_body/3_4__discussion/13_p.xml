<p class="p">Results of the present study agreed with other research where the dietary inclusion of feed ingredients with distinctive FA profile such as the hemp seed [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], flaxseed and stearidonic acid-enriched (C18:4 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3) soybean oils [
 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], modified the FA composition of chickensâ€™ egg yolk. The necessity to improve the FA profile of the larvae through substrate modulation in order to guarantee meat of satisfactory healthiness, was pointed out by previous papers on quails [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and chickens [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], where an increase in the saturation degree of lipids was observed to the expenses of the unsaturated fractions. Differently, the intense change in the FA composition (% of total FAME) of quail eggs due to the dietary inclusion of defatted BSF larva meal, and the consequent changes also in FA contents (mg/100 g egg) were in contrast with the only other work testing the BSF larva meal as feed ingredient for layers diets [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], where the FA profile of chicken eggs was slightly affected by the dietary treatment. Such finding highlights thus the necessity of further research investigations to clarify the effect of this emerging feed ingredient on the FA profile of eggs in different poultry species. A dietary improvement of the FA composition of the diet seems however a desirable aspect to take into consideration in order to ensure heathy eggs for consumers.
