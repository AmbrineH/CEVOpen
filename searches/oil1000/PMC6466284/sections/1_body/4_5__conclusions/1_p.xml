<p class="p">Based on the results of the present experiment, the defatted black soldier fly larvae meal can be considered a possible alternative ingredient to soybean meal in laying quail diets, up to the 15% inclusion level. No negative effects on the productive performance of birds were observed and eggs showed overall satisfactory physicochemical traits and sensory profile. Future studies should deeply investigate the impact of this feed ingredient on eggs’ fatty acid profile as contrasting results are currently available on this aspect. Furthermore, an improvement in the fatty acid composition of the larvae or a dietary incorporation of a PUFA-rich ingredient, together with the insect seems desirable to ensure healthy food products in line with modern consumers’ exigencies.</p>
