<p class="p">To guarantee enough material to perform all the scheduled analyses, the content of seven eggs was homogenized to one sample. Twelve samples/per treatment were considered, and they underwent freeze drying. The proximate composition of egg samples was analyzed in accordance with the AOAC [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] methods. The cholesterol content was determined through absolute quantitative analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following the method described by Casiraghi et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The FA profile of the eggs was analyzed following the same method previously described for the experimental diets, with the only exception that it used a binary mixture of solvents (hexane: Isopropanol 3:2). Then, the results expressed as % of total detected FAME and the total lipid content of the samples were used for the quantitative determination (mg/100 g egg) of FA.
