<p class="p">The lipid extraction of the diets was performed by Accelerated Solvent Extraction (M-ASE) using petroleum ether as the solvent. The FA profile was determined as described by Cullere et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Samples were trans-methylated using a methanolic solution of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (4%), in order to determine fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). A biphasic separation was obtained by adding 0.5 mL of distilled water and 1.5 mL of N-heptane to each sample. FAME were quantified by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC17A, 1, Nishinokyo-Kuwabara-cho, Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto 604-8511, Japan), equipped with an Omegawax® 250 column (30 m × 0.25 µm × 0.25 µm) (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, United States) and FID detector. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 0.8 mL/min. The injector and detector temperatures were both 260 °C. Peaks were identified based on commercially available FAME mixtures (37-Component FAME Mix, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA). The results are expressed as % of total detected FAME.
