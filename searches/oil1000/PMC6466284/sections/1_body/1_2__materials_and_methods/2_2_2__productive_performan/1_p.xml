<p class="p">Laying quails were individually weighed at the 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> week of dietary treatment, to monitor live weight change along the experiment. Feed intake was recorded weekly on a cage basis. Also, mortality was monitored along the trial. During this period the laid eggs per cage were counted and individually weighed daily; average egg weight was then calculated. Egg production was computed as n laid eggs/n laying quails Ã— 100. Defected eggs (i.e., broken, without solid shell, with unusual shape) were also daily counted and the percentage on the total laid eggs/cage was calculated. The feed conversion ratio was calculated as kg of feed consumed/kg of egg produced. At the 6
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> week, the eggs were collected in five consecutive days, then marked and analyzed for physicochemical quality, sensory profile and storage stability. A total of n = 210 eggs/treatment were used for physicochemical analysis, n = 60 eggs/treatment for the sensory analysis and n = 16 eggs/treatment for the storage stability.
