<p class="p">Performance data and egg physicochemical traits were subjected to two different one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with experimental diet (Control, BSF10 and BSF15) as fixed effect, following the GLM procedure of the SAS 9.1.3 statistical analysis software for Windows [

A mixed model (PROC MIXED) was used to detect any dietary influence on sensory analysis scores, therefore considering experimental diet and the ten panelists as fixed and random effects, respectively. Least square means were obtained using a Bonferroni test, and the significance was calculated at a 5% confidence level. The χ
