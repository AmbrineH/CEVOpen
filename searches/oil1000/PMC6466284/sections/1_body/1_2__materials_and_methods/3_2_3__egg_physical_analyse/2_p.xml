<p class="p">After physical measurements, the eggs were broken, and the eggshell was dried with a paper towel and weighed (±0.1 g), then eggshell thickness (mm) was measured at equatorial level with the digital caliper. The shell percentage was calculated as shell weight/egg weight × 100. The weight of the egg and of the edible portion (calculated as egg weight minus shell weight) were used to obtain the edible portion percentage: Edible portion (g)/egg weight (g) × 100. The pH of the albumen (±0.1) was determined in duplicate, and yolk color was evaluated by comparison with the 15-points Roche Yolk Color Fan (DSM, Wurmisweg 576, CH-4303 Kaiseraugst, Switzerland).</p>
