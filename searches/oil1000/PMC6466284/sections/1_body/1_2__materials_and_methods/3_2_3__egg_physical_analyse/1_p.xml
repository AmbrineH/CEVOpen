<p class="p">Eggs were transported to the laboratory of the Animal Medicine, Production and Health Department of the University of Padova (Italy) and were individually weighed. Further measurements were: Egg equatorial diameter (mm), and egg height (mm), using a digital caliper (Juwel Schraubtechnik, EB, Werkstraße 14, 57537 Wissen, Altenkirchen, Rheinland Palatinate, Germany) (0–150 mm—Juwel). Such measurements were used to calculate the shape index: equatorial diameter/height × 100. Surface area was calculated as follows: = 3.9782 × (egg weight)
