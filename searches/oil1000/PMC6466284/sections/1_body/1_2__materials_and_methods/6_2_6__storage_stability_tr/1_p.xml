<p class="p">The storage stability trial was carried out on 16 eggs/treatment. At egg collecting date (n = 8 eggs/treatment) and at day 28 of storage (n = 8 eggs/treatment), albumen pH and yolk thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) were measured. The pH was analyzed with a portable pH meter FG2-Five GoTM (Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland) which was calibrated at pH 4.0, 7.0, 9.0 and 12. The extent of egg yolk lipid oxidation (TBARs) was evaluated with a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-2000; Hitachi, Mannheim, Germany) set at 532 nm, that measured the absorbance of TBARs and a 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane calibration curve [
