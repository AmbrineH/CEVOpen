<p class="p">Samples were identified by a random three-digit code. Panelists were qualified as experts according to ISO 8586 and had experience with descriptive tests (ISO 13299) on various food matrices. All judges who perform tests with accredited methods undergo training every three years. Panelists underwent two pre-test training sessions of 1 h each to familiarize with the matrices, and select appropriate descriptors, also drawn from the literature. Furthermore, a list of possible off-flavors was also prepared: Off-flavors were chosen according to the expertise of the panel on the tested food product, and to the sensory characteristics of the feed (poultry feed). The eggs used for the training sessions were obtained from quails fed with a conventional diet: They were handled and cooked in the same manner of the samples which were used for the subsequent sensory analysis.</p>
