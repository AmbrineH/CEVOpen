<p class="p">Eggs were transported to the Sensory Analysis Division of the “Istituto per la Qualità e le Tecnologie Agroalimentari, Laboratorio Analisi Sensoriale (Veneto Agricoltura)”, Thiene, Vicenza, Italy. They were subjected to a descriptive sensory analysis, to detect possible differences among the dietary treatments. The sensory analysis was conducted on 60 eggs/treatment, and two days of analysis were scheduled (30 eggs/treatment/session). Eggs of each session were daily collected in the farm. The eggs were cooked (boiled) for 5 min, cooled by placing them under tap water, then peeled, and the yolk was separated from albumen and served to 10 panelists in random sequence. For every session, each panelist evaluated a total of 9 eggs (3 eggs/treatment). </p>
