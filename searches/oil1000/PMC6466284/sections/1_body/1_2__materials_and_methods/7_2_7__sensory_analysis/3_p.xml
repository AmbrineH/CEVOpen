<p class="p">The panel received a list of descriptors to score on numerical and continuous ten cm-long scales from 1 (the lowest score for each descriptor) to 10 (the highest score for each descriptor). The selected descriptors were: Odor intensity, aroma intensity, sweetness, saltiness, solubility and adhesiveness for yolk; odor intensity, aroma intensity, saltiness and consistency for albumen. Furthermore, for each sample, the panel was asked to indicate if and which of the listed tastes and off-flavors they could recognize. The chosen descriptors were: Bitterness, sourness, metallic, poultry, grass, feed, fish, rancid for yolk; bitterness, metallic, poultry, feed for albumen. The evaluation sheet, distribution of samples to the judges and data acquisition were performed using FIZZ software (BIOSYSTEMES FRANCE, St-Ouen l’Aumône, France) installed in ten terminals in the tasting booths of the laboratory. Still water at room temperature and unsalted crackers were available to panelists throughout each sensory session.</p>
