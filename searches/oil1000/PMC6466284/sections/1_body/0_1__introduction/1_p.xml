<p class="p">In the last years, insects have started being considered a part of the possible solution to directly alleviate food insecurity, but also to improve the sustainability of the livestock production. It has been demonstrated that if insects are farmed exploiting low value food processing by-products or high-impacting waste streams, their use in animal feeding can be environmentally more beneficial than traditional sources of proteins [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Insects are a natural dietary source of nutrients for many animal species, including free-range poultry and wild birds [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Despite this, insect-based feeds in the European Union are currently allowed only for aquaculture, whereas further research and thus legislative efforts to allow their utilization in poultry species is still required. One of the most promising and widely investigated insect species in this sense is the black soldier fly (

 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In this way the black soldier fly (BSF) can reduce the potential environmental load of waste streams, converting them into high valuable proteins (41–44% of the total dry matter), which could be used in feed formulations [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The protein derived from this efficient insect is also rich in essential amino acids, and it showed an overall superior amino acid profile compared to soybean meal [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study found that despite its high methionine: cysteine ratio (61:39), a complete replacement of soybean meal with BSF larva meal in broiler diets provided satisfactory outcomes without the need to modulate the optimal methionine: cysteine ratio [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. But BSF larvae are not only a source of protein; in fact, they have a high fat content (up to 35%), and they are rich in minerals, among which Ca (5–8% dry matter -DM-) and P (0.6% to 1.5% DM) [
