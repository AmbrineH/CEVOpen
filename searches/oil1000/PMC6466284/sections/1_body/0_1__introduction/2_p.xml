<p class="p">Because of all these positive features, together with being an insect species suitable for mass production, different research studies have been performed to evaluate the potential of including BSF in poultry diets. BSF meal was found to be an excellent source of energy, digestible amino acids, for broilers chickens [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], broiler quails [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and Barbary partridge [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], ensuring optimal health status and proving satisfactory growth performance and overall meat quality. Among widely consumed animal products, eggs are a low-cost source of high-quality protein, lipids, vitamins and minerals, thus being suitable for any kind of consumer [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Because of this, their production is rapidly increasing, and it is expected to reach the 89 million ton by 2030 [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. For this reason, the BSF larvae have also started being studied as a possible alternative ingredient for laying hens. Recent research studied layersâ€™ performance, intestinal morphometry, enzymatic and microbial activity, egg quality and sensory traits [
