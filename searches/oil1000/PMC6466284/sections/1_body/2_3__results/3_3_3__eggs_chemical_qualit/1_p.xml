 <xref rid="animals-09-00115-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> shows the effect of a dietary inclusion with 10% and 15% defatted BSF larvae meal on eggs’ proximate composition and cholesterol content. Eggs’ lipid and cholesterol contents were not affected by the dietary treatments. Differently, the protein content of quails’ eggs decreased with increasing the inclusion level of defatted BSF larvae meal: 12.1 vs. 12.1 vs. 11.9 g/100 g egg for Control, BSF10, BSF15 groups, respectively (
