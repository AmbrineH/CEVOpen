<p class="p">Results of the descriptive sensory analysis performed on eggs obtained from laying quails fed with increasing dietary inclusions of a defatted BSF larvae meal are depicted in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00115-t011" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00115-t012" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 12</xref>. Overall, the dietary treatment did not affect the considered variables neither for the yolk, nor for the albumen as similar values were recorded for Control, BSF10 and BSF15 eggs. Off-odors and off-flavors perception too remained unaffected by the dietary treatments, with the sole exception of the “feed” off-flavor, which increased from the Control to the BSF15 groups: Control eggs showed a lower value compared to BSF15 ones, with BSF10 eggs showing an intermediate score (5.55 vs. 13.9 vs. 19.4, for Control, BSF10 and BSF15 groups, respectively;
