<p class="p">The inclusion of either 10% or 15% defatted BSF larvae meal in the diets for laying quails did not affect the yolk oxidative status at day 0 of storage. Differently, when yolk oxidative status was analyzed again at 28 days of storage, TBARs values showed the lowest value in the BSF10 group and the highest in the Control eggs, with BSF15 being intermediate (1.72 vs. 1.60 vs. 1.66 mg MDA/kg egg for Control, BSF10 and BSF 15 groups, respectively;
