<p class="p">For the total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) an inverse situation was observed as it decreased from the Control to the BSF15 groups (25.5 vs. 20.8 vs. 18.7% of total FAME for Control, BSF10, BSF15, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This was due to a decrease both in the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 (23.5 vs. 19.2 vs. 17.7% of total FAME for Control, BSF10 and BSF15, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and in the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 (2.07 vs. 1.65 vs. 1.20% of total FAME for Control, BSF10 and BSF15, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) fractions. As the reduction in the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 PUFA was less intense than what it was observed at for 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFA, the ratio 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 worsened with the inclusion of defatted BSF larvae meal, with no differences between the BSF10 and BSF15 groups.
