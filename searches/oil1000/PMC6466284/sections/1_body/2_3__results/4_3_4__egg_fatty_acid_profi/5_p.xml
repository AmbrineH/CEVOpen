<p class="p">As a result of the consistent changes in the FA profile according to the dietary treatment, the health indexes of quailsâ€™ eggs were also influenced: The atherogenicity index (AI) and the thrombogenicity index (TI) increased, thus worsened, with increasing the inclusion level of defatted BSF larvae meal (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). As a result of a growing SFA content from the Control to the BSF15 groups, the peroxidability index (PI) linearly decreased, thus making the eggs of the BSF15 quails less susceptible to oxidative phenomena than those of the BSF10 and Control groups (35.1 vs. 40.5 vs. 46.9 for BSF15, BSF10 and Control groups, respectively;
