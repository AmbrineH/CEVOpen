 <xref rid="animals-09-00115-t009" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref> shows the effects of increasing the dietary inclusion with defatted BSF larvae meal (up to 15%) in quailsâ€™ diet on the FA profile of their eggs, expressed as mg/100 g egg. As it was previously observed for the FA expressed as a percentage of total FAME, the defatted BSF larvae meal greatly changed the total SFA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), MUFA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and PUFA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) contents, but mainly the highest inclusion level. Total SFA increased with the dietary incorporation of the defatted BSF larvae meal, but the difference became significant only between the Control and the BSF15 group, whereas BSF10 was intermediate. These changes were mainly due to the C12:0, C14:0, C16:0 and C22:0 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) FA. A similar pattern was observed also for the total MUFA, which differed only in the Control compared to the BSF15 groups (1125, 1235, 1288 mg/100 g egg for Control, BSF10, BSF15 groups, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). For this change the main FA involved were the C14:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9, C16:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9, and C18:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-11 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Differently from the other two main lipid classes, total PUFA content linearly decreased with increasing dietary defatted BSF larvae incorporation levels (800 vs. 664 vs. 601 mg/100 g egg for Control, BSF10, BSF15 groups, respectively; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This trend was mainly due to a redction of the C18:2 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6, C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 and C22:6 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) FA.
