<p class="p">The results on the productive performances of laying quails fed with increasing levels of defatted BSF larvae meal are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00115-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. Overall, the considered productive parameters weren’t affected by the dietary treatments. The average final live weight of the laying quails was 356 ± 4.5 g in the three experimental groups. Considering the 5-week feeding period, the average feed conversion ratio was 3.47 ± 0.1, quails produced an average of 384 ± 7 eggs, weighing 14.4 ± 0.2 g/each, with an average egg production of 74.8 ± 1.2%. The percentage of defected eggs averaged 2.18% and was not affected by the dietary treatment (
