<p class="p">Agarwood, also called Gaharu, Chén-xīang, Jin-koh, Kyara, or Oud, is the resinous wood formed in the heartwood of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees. 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species, including 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> (Lour.) Glig., 
 <italic class="italic">A. agallocha</italic> Roxb., and 
 <italic class="italic">A. malaccensis</italic> Lam., taxonomically belong to Thymelaeaceae and are found mainly in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia [

Agarwood has been used as incense in religious ceremonies for centuries as well as in traditional Chinese medicine for its sedative, aphrodisiac, carminative, and anti-emetic effects [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The value of agarwood depends on its quality. However, grading of agarwood tends to be discretionary and subjective, because agarwood is usually graded based on its physical properties, such as color, density, resin formation, by sensory panels [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Kynam, also known as Kanankoh in Japan, is regarded to have the highest quality among different varieties of agarwood [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The high resin content, better water sinking quality, and darker color of Kynam enable it to produce a special and pleasant scent [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Kynam has been considered to be the noblest spiritual wood, both in ancient societies and in modern times, because of its scarcity. At present, the cost of Kynam agarwood is about 350 Euro per gram [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Kynam agarwood has a very complex scent, and even grading professionals cannot easily distinguish it from others. Therefore, it is important and essential to develop analytic methods for judgment and grading of agarwood.
