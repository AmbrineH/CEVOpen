<p class="p">Chemical constituents of agarwood have been studied by several research teams [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Previous studies identified chemical constituents of agarwood essential oils or organic solvent extracts with column chromatography or spectroscopic techniques [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Other studies prepared agarwood essential oils, hydrodistillates, or solvent extracts for gas chromatography (GC) or multidimensional GC analysis [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, analysis of chemical constituents in agarwood solvent extracts is not suitable for differentiation of agarwood because agarwood is usually used to produce incense smoke. A few research studies analyzed chemical ingredients in the incense smoke produced by heated agarwood [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. For example, Ishihara et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] analyzed chemical constituents in the incense smoke that was trapped in the Tenax TA adsorbent resin, and extracted in diethyl ether for GC and GC-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. They found 53 chemical compounds in the incense smoke produced by high quality (Kanankoh) and low quality (Jinkoh) varieties of Vietnamese agarwood, and most of them were sesquiterpenes and aromatics. Hung et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] prepared an agarwood extract by heating a sealed vial that contained agarwood powder in a water bath at 90 Â°C for 30 min. The extract was absorbed in a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) needle with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber for 30 min, and then desorbed for GC-MS analysis. They found six peaks that could be used for evaluating the quality or price of the most expensive agarwood. Zhou et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] collected incense smoke produced by agarwood and incense sticks, absorbed the different kinds of collected incense smoke in glass fiber pads, and extracted substances from the glass fiber pads with dichloromethane for GC-MS analysis. Nevertheless, these studies analyzed chemical constituents in the incense smoke that was either absorbed in matrices or extracted in solvents.
