<p class="p">Analysis of chemical constituents in the incense smoke produced by agarwood may be an approach to grading of agarwood. Most of past research studies determine chemical ingredients in agarwood solvent extracts [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, analysis of chemical constituents in solvent extracts is not suitable in the case of agarwood because it is usually used to produce incense smoke. In this work, we used a headspace (HS) preheating system that is combined with GC-MS (HS GC-MS) to extract heavier sample matrices for GC analysis. Incense smoke produced by heated agarwood was directly analyzed with GC-MS. We could obtain more authentic chemical profiles of incense smoke produced by agarwood without solid-phase extraction. Moreover, by comparing chemical constituents in the incense smoke produced by different grades of agarwood, we found that HS GC/MS-MS could be used to grade quality of agarwood.
