<p class="p">So far, grading of agarwoods is flexible and subjective, because of the absence of standard grading system. Scent is the most important parameter for the quality assessment of agarwoods. In this work, we established a simple, automated, robust, and high-throughput method to analyze the incense smoke generated from a minimum amount of agarwood sample by HS GC-MS/MS. In comparison with the incense smoke constituents in Vietnam, Liao, and Cambodian agarwoods, we found that Kynam agarwood was composed of more complex constituents. Moreover, 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivative was present in Kynam instead of Vietnam, Liao, and Cambodia agarwoods, suggesting that the content of 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivative could be applied to grade the quality of agarwoods.</p>
