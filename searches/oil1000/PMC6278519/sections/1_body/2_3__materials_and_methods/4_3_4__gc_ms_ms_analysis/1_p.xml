<p class="p">Chemical constituents of incense smoke were analyzed by GS-MS/MS. Incense smoke (1 mL) was injected into GC-MS/MS (Model GC-2010 Plus and GCMS-TQ8040, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Temperature of sample line and transfer line was kept at 150 °C Ultra-high purity helium (99.99%) was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 5.1 mL/min. The chromatographic separation was conducted with SH-Rxi-5Sil MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm thickness, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The column temperature program was set as follows: 60 °C initial temperature and subsequently ramped to 140 °C at a rate of 6 °C/min, held at 140 °C for 5 min, ramped to 160 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, held at 160 °C for 5 min, ramped to 280 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, held at 280 °C for 10 min. The GC-MS interface temperature was maintained at 250 °C. Electron ionization was used as the ionization method, and the ion source temperature was set at 230 °C. The mass spectra obtained with full scan and the mass ranged from
