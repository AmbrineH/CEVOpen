 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02969" class="xref">Figure S1</xref> shows the GC chemical fingerprint of incense smoke produced by Kynam agarwood. The detection period was setup from 2.5 min to 65 min. Forty peaks were identified in the GC-MS/MS analysis, and the identified compounds are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02969-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02969-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, these compounds belong to different kinds of chemical categories, including aromatics (33%), sesquiterpenes (38%), alkanes (8%), terpene (3%), triterpenes (3%), and others (18%). Since sesquiterpenes and triterpenes were mostly identified in agarwoods, other terpenes, except sesquiterpenes and triterpenes, were classified as “terpene” in this study. Moreover, the major component in the incense smoke of Kynam was 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone (27.23%).
