 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] used direct analysis with real time time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-TOFMS) to analyze 60 commercial agarwood chips without extraction, and identified the presence of key ions and the characteristics of 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones. They found that 8â€“16 target chromone ions were present in each sample. These results showed that the highly oxidized agarwood chromones were specific to
