<p class="p">In 1993, Ishihara et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] analyzed two kinds of agarwood incense smoke obtained with solvent extraction. Fifty components were identified in higher quality agarwood, while 36 components were identified in low quality agarwood. The incense smoke of both higher and low-quality agarwood was composed mainly of sesquiterpenes (53% and 61%, respectively) and aromatics (44% and 31%, respectively). The major components in higher quality agarwood were guaia-1(10), 11-dien-15-oic acid (9.92%), and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone (5.83%). Hung et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] identified 17 components that could be used as markers for classification and differentiation of agarwood. 2-(2-Phenylethyl) chromone derivatives (flindersiachromone) were also identified in most expensive agarwoods.
