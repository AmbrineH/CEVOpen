<p class="p">To further compare chemical constituents in the incense smoke produced by Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian varieties of agarwood with those in the same produced by the Kynam variety, we prepared the incense smoke using a HS preheating system, and the smoke was directly injected to GC for chemical identification. Lao agarwood shares similar physical properties with Cambodian agarwood, and both varieties exhibited similar patterns in GC (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02969" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>). A total of 110 constituents were identified in the incense smoke produced by four varieties of agarwood, including 40 compounds in the Kynam variety, 25 compounds in the Vietnamese variety, 45 compounds in the Lao variety, and 31 compounds in the Cambodian variety. Four compounds were commonly identified in the four varieties of agarwood, while 28, 13, 26, and 19 compounds were specifically identified in the Kynam, Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian varieties of agarwood, respectively (

Ismail et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] analyzed the chemical constituents of agarwood oil that was absorbed in PDMS and divinylbenzene-carboxen-PDMS, and found that 4-phenyl-2-butanone was one of the major compounds that contributed to the scent. 4-Methoxy-benzaldehyde was the first compound identified in the incense smoke of agarwood in this study, whereas it had not been identified in agarwood smoke or oils in other studies. These findings indicate that the identification of constituents in agarwood is affected by adsorbents. Therefore, more authentic chemical profiles of agarwood can be achieved with the use of incense smoke without matrix absorption.
