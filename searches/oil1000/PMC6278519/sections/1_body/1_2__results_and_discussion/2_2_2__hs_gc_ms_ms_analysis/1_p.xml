<p class="p">Chemical constituents of agarwood have been intensively studied by several research teams [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Different extraction methods have been developed to determine chemical composition of essential oils and related compounds from agarwood chips using GC, GC-MS, solid phase microextraction, GC-flame ionization detector, GC-olfactometry, or comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Most studies suggest that hydrodistillation is the method of choice for determining the essential oil content of agarwood [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Agarwood has only a slight scent at room temperature, and releases a pleasant aroma when heated. Burning incense is a common traditional practice in many families and most temples in Asia, for religious reasons and for its pleasant smell [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Incense smoke contains many kinds of fragrant sesquiterpenes and aromatics [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Without interphase mass transfer, how to obtain a large amount of incense smoke is an important parameter for efficient analysis. Therefore, we prepared the incense smoke of agarwood using a HS preheating system, and tested the incubation times and temperatures to obtain the maximum amount of analytes. Previous studies extracted agarwood oils through incubation at 40 °C for 10 min, or at 90 °C for 30 min [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In this study, we prepared the incense smoke of agarwood through incubation at 150 °C for 30 min, and injected the smoke into GC-MS/MS for chemical profiling analysis (
