<p class="p">Sesquiterpenoids and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone derivatives are two predominant constituents in agarwood [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Sesquiterpenoids, the essential ingredients in luxury perfumes, have been identified in different varieties of agarwood. In addition to sesquiterpenes, 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone derivative (flindersiachromone, 2-phenethyl-4
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-chromen-4-one) is another key reference constituent in agarwood. 2-(2-Phenylethyl)chromone derivatives can only be extracted in solvents or supercritical CO

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Substitute chromones in different grades of agarwood have also been studied. 2-(2-Phenylethyl) chromone derivatives can be detected in 76% of agarwood chips using direct analysis with DART-TOFMS without chemical extraction; however, DART-TOFMS is only used for distinguishing

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. One previous study showed that 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives were found in incense smoke produced by Vietnamese agarwood, with a GC peak area of 5.83% in Kanankoh (high quality variety of agarwood) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Another study also showed that 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives were present only in expensive agarwood [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In this study, we found that 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones were identified in the incense smoke of the Kynam variety (27.23%), but not in the same of Vietnamese, Lao, or Cambodian variety. So far, 39 different 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone derivatives have been identified in different varieties of agarwood [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-02969" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In line with these studies, our findings suggest that analysis of 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone derivatives can be used to assess quality of agarwood. Moreover, the contents of 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone derivative in triple duplicates of Kynam smoke were 25.18%, 27.23%, and 26.17% (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-02969" class="xref">Supplementary Materials Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, our data suggested that the HS GC/MS developed in this study can be a useful tool for grading quality of agarwood through direct analysis of incense smoke.
