 <p> Probit transformed response frequency expressed as percentage deterrence in relation to standard log-transformed ULV application times for C. citratus (a), G. procumbens (b) and R. officinalis (c) (dots out of the scale are not plotted). In all cases, standard 10% dilutions (v/v) of essential oil concentrates were used for the ULV treatments and ULV 50 represents the median of the moth tolerance distribution against essential oils. </p>
