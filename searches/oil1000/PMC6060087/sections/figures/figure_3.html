 <p> Volume median diameter (VMD ) probability distribution frequencies of the fine droplets that were settled on the microscope slides using the ULV – olfactory apparatus under different bar pressures (variables). Dots represent counts and line the fitted log transformed exponential model. All Measurements were performed using standard nozzle 0.8 mm in diameter. Mean: λ −1 , N: number of droplets classes, AD: Anderson-Darling statistics and the corresponding p-value for each distribution (p-values greater than α:0.05 suggests that the data follow the exponential distribution). </p>
