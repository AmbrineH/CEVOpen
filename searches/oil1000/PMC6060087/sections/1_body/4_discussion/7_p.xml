<p id="par0265" class="p">Thus, the chemical nature of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> essential oils may have contributed to its weaker activity since the main constituents are the low toxicity aldehydes citral and neral (70% in content) [
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], the monoterpene myrcene and the terpenic alcohol geranial [
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, are reach in high toxicity terpenic alcohols such as 1,8-cineole (35.32%), trans-caryophyllene (14.47%), borneol (9.37%), camphor (8.97%), α-pinene (7.9%) and α-thujone (6.42%). Finally, the fact that the primary constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic> oil are very poor in monoterpenoids content [
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], in which limonene is the most dominant (2.17%), but are very rich in methyl salicylate (96.9%) which possess antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], may explain the weak bioactivity that was register in most cases.
