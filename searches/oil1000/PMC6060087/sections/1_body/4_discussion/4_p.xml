<p id="par0250" class="p">Among the three essential oils tested, 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic> had weaker oviposition deterrent effects in contrast to 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> which have affected the number of eggs laid in choice experiments. These findings are in accordance with Paranagame et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] and Papachristos and Stamopoulos [
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] who respectively found that 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> oils were effective against certain insect and that of Setiawati et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], which showed, in choice and non-choice tests, that concentrations of citronella oil (the major component of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic>) reduced egg laying in 
 <italic class="italic">Helicoverpa armigera</italic> by 53–66%. The practical implication of these findings is that when an oviposition substrate is exposed to essential oil drops, satisfactory deterrents may be achieved few days after application even if some insect survive a direct exposure and lay eggs. Behavioral and sub lethal effects have been also demonstrated for major essential oil components such as the structurally related lower terpenes for 
 <italic class="italic">Myzus persicae</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. However, it should be also noted that the registered adverse effects in egg production may be related to the female’s shorter life spans and not only on indirect effects of essential oils on fecundity and adult maternity.
