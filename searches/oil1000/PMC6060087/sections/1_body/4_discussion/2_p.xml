<p id="par0240" class="p">Nevertheless, a part of the repellent activity, another important consideration which brought out by the study is the substanceâ€™s possible latent insecticidal properties which are expressed in the form of knock down symptoms and latent mortality. In the current experiments, for example, both 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> caused knock down symptoms and a considerable number of moths failed to recover. Therefore, these essential oils should probably not be considered only as repellents, but also as potential insecticides as well. Consequently, such properties should not be ignored when evaluating the bioactivity of essential oils droplets as repellents, since they can reduce pest damage also due to their potential insecticidal activity.
