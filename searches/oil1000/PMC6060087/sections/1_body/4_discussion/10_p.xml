<p id="par0280" class="p">From a practical point of view, the current laboratory bioassays can be used to evaluate the bioactivity of essential oils and other bio-rational compounds, which exert multilateral influence during a short limited period after their application. However, in contrast to traditional pesticides (i.e. pyrehtroids, some organophosphates and carbamates), in which the insecticidal properties are present at the time of application; essential oils may express their multilateral mode of action few hours and/or days later. Thus, although the use of essential oils in IPM is delicate because of the multiplicity of their phytochemical patterns and bioactivity, in the possible use of essential oils under field conditions it should be borne in mind that longer exposure periods are needed to be affective.</p>
