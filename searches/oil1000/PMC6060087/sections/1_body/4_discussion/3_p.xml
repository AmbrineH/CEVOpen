<p id="par0245" class="p">Considering the droplet size, although the main objective of this study was not to rank, or statistically separate drop size volumes, related information was also obtained and may be comparable to other studies. The drop size calibration method, although rather simple compared to other [

 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[62]</xref>], provide means to determining and applying the desired droplet spectrum and may help to minimize the spray drift and problems that followed by. Moreover, the frequency of drop size volumes is well described according to the exponential models that were applied, while the effect of pressure on drop size volumes seems to follow a power law. However, in most cases drop diameter falls in the range of 80 μm–400 μm, which usually calls for mist (100 μm) and fine sprays (100–400 μm), having medium to large size droplets, compared to commercial aerosols and fogs. The latest are defined as very fine particles or droplets suspended in air (and ranging in size from 0.1 to 50 μm). At a first look such kind of variations may represent a disadvantage for the reliability of plant treatments in field trials. For vector control with space sprays for instance, the droplet size should be less than 30 μm volume median diameter [

Nevertheless, it is most desirable for Lepidoptera and related fruit pest species, to generate larger droplets (i.e. ∼100 μm) to meet specific application scenarios such as deposing essential oils in which droplets should be retained on host surface for a period of time and form repellent and deterrent plant barriers.
