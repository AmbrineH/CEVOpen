<p id="par0260" class="p">Concerning the observed differences among the compounds tested it may be attributed to the specific chemical nature of the essential oils which may possess higher or lower bioactivity properties. Correlating the observed toxicity of essential oils (i.e. rosemary, lavender and eucalyptus) with their chemical composition revealed that their insecticidal properties depend on their total oxygenated monoterpenoid content [
