<p id="par0235" class="p">The analysis of the bioassay data showed that ULV of all three essential oils that were tested exhibit strong repellent activity against 
 <italic class="italic">A. lineatella</italic> moths. In addition, the repellent activity of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, was higher compared to the other two essential oils that were tested. Moths for example expressed approximately 3â€“5 fold faster moving behavior when treated with 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, compared to 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic> and
