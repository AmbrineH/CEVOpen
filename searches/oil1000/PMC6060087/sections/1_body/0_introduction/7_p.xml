<p id="par0035" class="p">The objective of this study was to evaluate 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> repellency and oviposition deterrence effects of three essential oils, including 
 <italic class="italic">Gaultheria procumbens</italic> (winter green), 
 <italic class="italic">Cymbobogon citratus</italic> (lemon grass) and 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> (Rosemary) against 
 <italic class="italic">A. lineatella</italic> moths. These plant extracts have traditionally attracted most research duo to their high bioactivity on other species and where therefore selected to be tested as potential repellence and oviposition deterrence compounds. Moreover, the recent researcher of ULV aerial sprays, for rational pest control, provided the stimulus for the design and conduction of prototype ULV olfactory experiments instead of simply use of essential oil vapours that are used in traditional studies.
