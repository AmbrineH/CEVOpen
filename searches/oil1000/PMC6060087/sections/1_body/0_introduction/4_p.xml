<p id="par0020" class="p">Essential oils of botanical origin are probably among the best-known substances to have attracted attention in recent years as potential bio-rational pest control agents due to their insecticidal, repellent and/or antifeedant properties [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[16]</xref>]. Therefore, many studies have been undertaken to establish new control practices with lower mammalian toxicity and low persistence in the environment and especially using essential oils [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, most are volatile and can act as fumigants, thus offering the prospect of use as repellent mostly against stored pest species [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Moreover, due to the low negative side effects on humans, essential oils have been evaluated to repel vector borne diseases [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. As a result, most bioassays were done for Diptera species, in particular those ones belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>] and which are related to diseases of public health concern such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue and viral encephalitis. Nevertheless, because stylization, application and persistence of essential oils is fraught with difficulties, bioactivity studies on other species, including agricultural pests [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[29]</xref>] and particularly Lepidoptera pest threats, have received less attention.
