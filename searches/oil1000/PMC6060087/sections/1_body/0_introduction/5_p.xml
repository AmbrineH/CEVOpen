<p id="par0025" class="p">Recent evaluations of Ultra Low Volume (ULV) and thermal fog application have been reported as effective means to apply repellents in different environments and particularly against mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Among the main advantage of the ULV application are: shorter application time due to higher flow rate (liter/hour), lower concentration of active ingredient (lower hazard). According to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ULV as used in common agricultural practice for instance refers to a total volume of 0.5 gal or less per acre (∼1.89 L per acre, or ∼4.67 l/ha) broadcast.
