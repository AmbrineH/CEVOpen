<p id="par0085" class="p">Plant material consisting of peach twigs having one fruit and 2–5 leaves (∼5–10 cm) served as oviposition substrate. The plant material was plugged by the same manner as previous described for moth rearing, in two small circular plastic cups (3 by 3 cm) with dental roll wick providing adults with 10% sucrose solution. The plant material was treated with standard ULV 15 s time-dosages of standard concentrates using the olfactometer device. Plant material sprayed with distillated water, soybeen oil and emulsifier (Tween 20) served as untreated check. All ULV treated oviposition substrates were air dried for 15 min and then placed insight the oviposition cages.</p>
