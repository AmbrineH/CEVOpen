<p id="par0090" class="p">In the choice test, treated and untreated plant material was placed in the same plastic cages, 32 cm apart, to provide a choice for oviposition. Cages were effectively split into two, with a ‘treated’ half and a ‘control’ half. The individual oil treated oviposition substrates were assigned at random to 30 cages (equivalent to main plots) so that there were at least five to ten replicates per treatment. In the no-choice test, the treated and untreated fruits were placed in different cages, each containing 2–5 females. The experiment was arranged according to a randomized complete block design. The numbers of eggs laid per female per 24 h, and survival of females, were recorded. Experiments were terminated when all females died.</p>
