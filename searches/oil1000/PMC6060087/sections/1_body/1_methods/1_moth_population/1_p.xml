 <italic class="italic">A. lineatella</italic> was established in the Laboratory of Applied Zoology and Parasitology in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Thessaloniki, Greece), from field-collected larvae present on infested twigs and peaches in northern Greece and as described by Damos and Savopoulou-Soultani [

 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[37]</xref>] and all stages maintained at rearing chambers at constant laboratory conditions at 25 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 5% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D)h. Adults were sexed and maintained insight plastic truncated conical caps (5 by 7.5 by 9.2 cm), covered by a transparent plastic sheet before treatment. A hole in the bottom of each cup was punched and plugged with dental roll wick providing adults with 10% sucrose solution.
