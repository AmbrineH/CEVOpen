<p id="par0065" class="p">The median diameter of all the particles collected on single slides by gravitational settling was determined by calculating the volume of each droplet. Microscope slides were placed in the center of the ULV-olfactory device and treated with essential oils for 5 s. The ULV droplets that have been deposited 5 min after treatment on the slide were placed under a microscope to measure diameter of individual droplets with an eyepiece micrometer. All particles that were deposited from the one side of the slide to the other and that passed through the micrometer scale, as the slide was moved, were measured. Measurement was avoided in cases in which particles of the smaller size groups were congregated along the margin of the slide and were difficult to be counted as separate. The number of the particles that were deposited on the slide were measured and clustered in 12 ranks-classes according to their diameter and compared, for confirmative reasons, with water sensitive cards of standard droplet deposition (Courting spraying systems Co, Syngenta Crop Protection, 2002). The diameter of the particles was measured in microns (1 μ  = 1 μm = 1/1000 mm = 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> m). The effect of pressure on the particle diameter was examined using four flow rate- pressure settings: 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and for a standard 0.8 mm nozzle.
