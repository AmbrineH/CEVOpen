<p id="par0060" class="p">In principle the device consist of two cages, B and C, which are connected through a tunnel D. The cage B is enclosed insight a larger plastic chamber A in which the ULV particles are sprayed through a 0.8 mm droplet nozzle. For the repellency and bioactivity studies 10–20, 3 days old, male and female moths were placed insight the cage B and treated with ULV of essential oils for certain times. Preliminary trials were carried out; first to measure the mean droplet size produced using the ULV customized devise, as well as the effect of pressure on droplet size distribution and then, to estimate the mean ULV spray application times that may affect moth movement. Thus, based on these trials, moths were subjected to ULV treatments for two time intervals, for 5 and 10 s, using an 0.8 mm in diameter nozzle and 2 bar pressure (see below), which corresponds to ULV volumes of 63.09 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> and 126.18 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> for each time treatment respectively.
