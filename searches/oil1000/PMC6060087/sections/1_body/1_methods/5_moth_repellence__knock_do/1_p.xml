<p id="par0075" class="p">For the repellency studies the criterion was migration of moths from chamber B to C via the tunnel D after 1, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120â€¯min. In addition, the bioactivity of the selected essential oils against fruit moth was further evaluated by considering the number of knocked downed and dead moths registered in chamber C at the previous time intervals. Bioassays were based on dose-response trials and probit-analysis (see below). In this approach the biological responses of interest is plotted against different doses of the same causal stimuli (or logarithms of them) and by taking into account the natural response rate (i.e. zero-dose using the same solvent). For each essential oil treatments were performed and at least five replications. For the record, although knock down and mortality evaluation are usually tested under conditions that are not repellent this option was not chosen because the current work aimed to evaluate both; the repellent activity of the essential oils as well as any latent adverse effects that are observable short time after the moth exposure to the ULV. Additionally, such an approach is considered to be closer to field conditions. Particularly, it is of interest not only if an insect is repelled after the application of a bioactive compound, but also, if it is lethal affected short time later after its movement.</p>
