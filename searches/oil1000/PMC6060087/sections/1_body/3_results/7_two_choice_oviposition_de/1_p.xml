 <xref rid="fig0045" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 9</xref> show the results of the two choice tests for the three essential oils that were tested in the form of ULV and applied for a 15 s time-dose. In most cases the essential oils had a significant effect on the number of eggs laid per day by female fruit moths (
 <italic class="italic">A. lineatella</italic>) in the choice test (
 <xref rid="fig0045" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 9</xref>). 
 <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 10</xref> depicts the pooled oviposition deterrence data (cumulative egg laying) that were registered after 5, 10 and 15 days of observations. Among the essential oils tested, 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic> had no adverse effects on moth fecundity at any times that were registered, while 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> produced a significant reduction in almost all cases, with the later showing the strongest effect. Moderate adverse effects on oviposition preference were recorded for 
 <italic class="italic">C.citratus</italic> and a considerable lower number of eggs were laid on the oviposition substrates that were treated, although differences were significant only for the first days of observation (
 <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 10</xref>). In particular, moths laid the same number of eggs on the treated substrate compared to the control, after 5 days (9 ± 2 and 11 ± 0.9 eggs), but not after 10days (21.4 ± 2.2 and 28.6 ± 2.6) or 15 days (30.6 ± 2 και 34.4 ± 2), respectively.
