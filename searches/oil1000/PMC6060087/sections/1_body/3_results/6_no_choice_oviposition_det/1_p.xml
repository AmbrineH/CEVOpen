 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> and the few available replications, it was difficult to estimate the indirect effects on oviposition for this essential oil. Both essential oils, 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic>, reduced the total egg production by half compared to the control. Females laid 64.4 ± 12.3 eggs on oviposition substrate that was treated with ULV of 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic>, 59.8 ± 6.8 eggs on substrate treated with 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 128 ± 7.4eggs on the control. Spraying peach fruits with standard ULV (time-dose: 15 s) with essential oils, showed that the applications significantly reduced the number of eggs and according to the parametric (
