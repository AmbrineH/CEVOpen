<p id="par0190" class="p">Because the spray solution emerges from the nozzle in a sheet, and droplets form at the edge of the sheet, as spray pressure increases the sheet becomes thinner, it probably breaks into smaller droplets than from a sheet produced at lower pressure. Thus, the diameter of the spray droplet is inverse related to spray pressure (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> &gt; 0.9). According to the power law model and for a standard nozzle diameter (0.8 mm) to compensate decrease in volume size as soluble flow increases, moderate pressures of 2 bar produce 250 μm droplets. However, there are no considerable differences when pressure increases from 3 to 4 bars and produced droplets have approximately the same VMDs.
