<p id="par0200" class="p">Probit analysis data concerning repellent activity of essential oils on 
 <italic class="italic">A. lineatella</italic> moths and for two different ULV application times are given in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table1</xref>. These values represent the median response times to the half of the moth population when treated with standard ULV of essential oils and is been used to estimate more precisely how the stimulus has been perceived by the moths. The median response times RT
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for moths treated with ULV essential oil for certain time differ for each case. As in the case of the dose response bioassays, migration time of moths from the treatment chamber B, to the clear chamber C via the tunnel were shorter for cohorts that were exposed for longer time with essential oils ULVs. For example, half of the individuals that were treated for 15 s with 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, migrated after half an hour (21.099 and 32.688 min, for male and females respectively), while moths treated for 5 s migrated after one hour (65.832 min and 67.306 min, for males and females respectively). Such patterns were also observed when the moths treated with the other two essential oils, although individuals remained for longer times in the treatment chamber before migrating. It also is noteworthy to indicate that in some cases (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> on the 15 s treatments), probit analysis produced low-value slopes due to some infrequent observations (outliers) and no confidence intervals, although

  <sup class="sup">2</sup>
 </italic> was quite high suggesting good model fit. Finally, there were no significant differences concerning moving behavior between male and female moths.
