<p id="par0210" class="p">In this trial I have considered the individuals that either died short time after the ULV application or were able to migrate and were knocked down few minutes later and were not able to recover. The calculated lethal response times, LT
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, to ULV treatments, 95% confidence limits and probit transformed regressions data are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Both, 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic>, had high insecticidal properties in contrast to 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> which had not adverse effect on moths. Moreover, moths lived shorter period of time when treated with 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> (LT
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>: 14.026 and 36.548 min, for male and females), compared to those treated with 
 <italic class="italic">Gaultheria procumbens. (</italic>LT
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>: 90.610 and 59.783 min, for male and females). A slight increase of susceptibility in adults with increasing ULV time doses was observed for 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic>, while no significant differences were recorded for 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic>. It is worthy to state that in most cases 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> caused direct mortality short time after its application, while 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> mostly displayed an indirect mode of action since moths firstly were knocked downed and some of them failed to recover. No significant differences were recorded between the two sexes.
