 <sub class="sub">50</sub> moth deterrence was expressed as percentage deterrence in relation to standard log transformed ULV application times for each case (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>a–c, respectively). Fitting of the probit transformed model is considered only on normal equivalent deviate and without adding 5. Therefore, according to the probit model the log ULV
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> corresponds to the value of probit = 0 and the observed probits which are plotted against lie almost on a straight line. Alternatively, the ULV
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values can be regarded as the median of the tolerance distribution which was used to evaluate the actual level of tolerance such that the half moths lie on either side of it. These bioassay tests indicated that all treatments, except control, caused repellence to
