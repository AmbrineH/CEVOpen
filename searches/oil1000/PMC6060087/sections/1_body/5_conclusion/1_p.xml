<p id="par0285" class="p">The device which has been developed can be used to establish olfactory trials under laboratory conditions using Ultra Low Volumes. Moreover, the screening of potential compounds under laboratory condition may save time and cost before filed testing. One important advantage of using ULV formulations of essential and potentially other compounds is to express bioactivity with the lowest concertation. According to the current results all three essential oils that were tested causing repellence and in some cases oviposition deterrence when sprayed in the moth environment in the form of ULV droplets. Moreover, a part of the repellent activity the essential oils may act as insecticides and cause knock down symptoms and mortality. Among the essential oil tested, 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> was most active compared to 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. procumbens</italic>. Additionally, it is possible that oils may readily impinge on host surface and act also as ovipostion deterrents. Consequently, these properties can be exploitable in two different applications: either as repellents/insecticides and oviposition deterrents. Though the applied method and these findings are limited to lab conditions, they could form a basis for further bioassay improvement and investigation of the questions raised in this work. In particular, additional field research is needed in conjunction with the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> method trials to improve our understanding insecticidal properties of essential oils and to verify the effect of essential oils on natural populations and under field conditions and this is the object of the next designed study. Finally, the method can be applied to screen the bioactivity of ULV volumes of other compounds as well.
