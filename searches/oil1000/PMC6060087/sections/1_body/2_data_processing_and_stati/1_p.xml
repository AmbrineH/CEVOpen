<p id="par0095" class="p">Prior any data analysis the percentages of time responses (e.g. repellency, knockdown effects and mortality) were corrected for the natural response rate by using Abbott's calculation formula as follows [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]: Corrected % response = (% response in test − % response in control)/(100 − % response in control) × 100. To meet normality, which is recommended particularly for parametric mean comparisons and analysis of variance (ANOVA) [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], data were transformed using arcsine √x transformation [
