<p id="par0115" class="p">Firstly, preliminary bioassay tests were carried out to determine the effective time application of standard ULV concentrations for each treatment. Five application times (1, 5, 10, 15 and 30
 <italic class="italic">sec</italic>) were tested for each essential oil and were subjected to probit analysis. After the estimation of the effective time range, two representative ULV application times were selected (5 and 15â€¯s) and separate bioassay tests were carried out to determine bioactivity (repellence, knock down and mortality) and estimate mean time responses of the moths to essential oils treatments. In particular, the data that were obtained from each time-response bioassay were subjected to probit analysis using the following probit analysis algorithm [
