 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) with 2 L processing vessel with a steam jacket (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, step a); where thermal treatment in this vessel is achieved using saturated steam with pressure varying from 3 up to 12 bars (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, step b and c). Relative pressure of vacuum tank (130 L) maintained at −0.9 bar during process inside the vessel (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, step e). After placing 100 g of dried orange peel in the vessel, the steam was injected in a vessel. Maximum pressure of saturated steam used in our case was 15 bars. This stage lasted few seconds (phase d) and ended by an abrupt pressure drop towards a vacuum (phase e) by opening the pneumatic valve between the treatment and vacuum thank. The essential oils are extracted as stable oil in water emulsion. Then it transferred to Clevenger apparatus, distillation operation was performed for 30 min. Afterwards, the orange peels were recovered and dried at room temperature. Steam explosion process' cycle can be divided into six steps as shown in
