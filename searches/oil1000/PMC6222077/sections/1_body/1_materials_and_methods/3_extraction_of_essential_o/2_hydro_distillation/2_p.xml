<p id="p0040" class="p">Hydro-distillation is a variant of steam distillation, for the extraction of essential oil from dried samples in the laboratory. As opposed to the steam input, the samples materials in hydro-distillation are directly immersed in distilled water. This solid-liquid mixture is then heated until boiling under atmospheric pressure in an alembic, where the heat allows the release of odorous molecules in plant cells. This volatile aroma compounds and water forms an azeotropic (azeotropes
 <bold class="bold">)</bold> mixture, which can be evaporated together at the similar pressure and after that condensed and divided in a Florentine flask due to their density difference and immiscibility. Moreover, a cohobating system can recycle the distilled water through a siphon so as to improve the yield and quality of essential oil (
