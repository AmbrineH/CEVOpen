<p id="p0060" class="p">A gas chromatograph-mass spectrophotometer (GC–MS) was used in this study to analyze the essential oils. The system had a gas chromatograph (6890 GC, Hewlett-Packard, USA) coupled to a mass spectrometer (5973A, Hewlett-Packard), by means of two columns as fused-silica-capillary with different phases. The non-symmetrical column was 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness (HP5MS) and the symmetrical column was a Stabilwax inclusive of Carbowax–PEG (60 m × 0.2 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness). GC–MS spectra were taken by the following conditions: transporter gas, He; flow rate, 1 ml/min; split mode 1/20; injection volume, 1 μl; injection temperature, 250 °C; oven temperature program, 60 °C for 8 min, then increased at 2 °C/min to 250 °C and held at 250 °C for 15 min; ionization mode, electronic impact at 70 eV.v (
