<p id="p0070" class="p">The efficacy of independent variables (pressure: 3–15 bar, and time: 15–480 s) on extracted oils was investigated. Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and standard error were conducted by means of IBM SPSS Statistics version 18.0 (IBM Company, USA) was applied for statistical analysis of data and after passing factorial test, the one way ANOVAs was implemented to assess the significance of essential oil extraction between time and pressure while the Holm–Sidak method was used for multiple comparisons of mean value between groups. Variance (Balasubramaniam, Barbosa-Cánovas, &amp; Lelieveld) was performed to determine significant differences between independent variables (P ≤ 0.05).</p>
