<p id="p0080" class="p">Hydro-distillation is a traditional and widely used method for extraction of plants essential oils. Pressure, temperature and time are main factors in the design of an extraction method. One of the shortcomings observed in hydro-distillation experiments is the fact that during the process, temperature and pressure cannot be controlled. On the other hand, the amount of distillation of the essential oil extracted from the peels is highly dependent on the temperature and corresponding pressure of extraction. In order to compare the essential oil yield, hydro-distillation is considered as a reference treatment, and each experiment was carried out in five repetitions for four hours. The temperature was set to the boiling point of water and the pressure was slightly higher than the environment. The average yield of the extracted essential oil turns out to be 1.2 ± 0.1 ml/g dry material (dm) and in range of 1.1 ± 0.1 ml/g (dm) to 1.30 ± 0.1. In all the treatments, three separate intervals were observed. In the first interval, the extraction rate remained constant. In the next interval, this rate was increased significantly while it became constant in the third interval (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Allaf and Allaf, 2016</xref>): During the first part of the heating, a breakdown of cell structures begins. As the heating continues, the rate of cell breakdown increased significantly until all the structure is degraded. This means that the penetration of solvent in the tissue, the rate at which oil was removed from the peel is solely dependent on the heating time. The result (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), can be explained by the fact that the rate of oil separation from the plant material is affected by availability of the relative essential oils in pore what make up the oil; rather it is influenced by their solubility in the liquid phase. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that it should take time that could still be trapped within the tissues of the plant (
