<p id="p0075" class="p">In order to investigate the extraction yield of orange peels, they were crushed and treated by steam explosion processes in the range of 3–15 bars and 15–480 seconds. In addition, the extraction yield of essential oil by steam explosion is also compared with a hydro-distillation method. In this study, the pretreatment time, pressure and the concentration of the chemicals component are considered as treatment variable factors, and the effects of the treatment is measured using the produced essential oil.</p>
