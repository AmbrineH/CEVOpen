<p id="p0095" class="p">The best temperature and pressure range for the steam explosion process was in the range of 8–12 bars and 260–240 s, respectively. The temperature increased due to increasing pressure, the process time must reduce because peels are burned. So the efficacy of temperature is as a variable depending on the pressure. Therefore, in comparison with the hydro-distillation method, the yield increased and the extraction time decreased (

In the following section, the comparison of the essential oils extracted from the two methods completely reveals the effect of the process parameters on the chemical compositions.
