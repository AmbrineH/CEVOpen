<p id="p0090" class="p">The improved and optimized conditions of extraction operation were determined with the goal to maximize and minimize the extraction yield. It was hence calculated as an optimum value of extraction yield of 1.34 ± 0.011 (ml), with the pressure of 10 bar and a total time t equal to 240 s. Higher values of time of treatment slightly reduced the value of extraction yields (0.58–1.24 ± 0.011 ml in 480 s) as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>. An extraction yield was attenuated after a peak as a function of the total time. During the process time (240–480 second), in a constant pressure (10 bar), the essential oil is reversed from the pores to the extraction medium (

 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>), while the yield of extracted oil dropped sharply at too low pressure. It is probably because volatile component and essential oils did not have enough time to cross the cell wall and mass transfer (

 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). To justify this process behavior can be said that agitation of the surrounding solvent (vapor) normally allows the transport of solute from the product surface to the outside by convection (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Balasubramaniam et al., 2016</xref>). By adding a vacuum step, the efficient exchange surfaces achieve a higher rate than the flat surface. Also, the decompression creates a larger temperature discrepancy between the two steps only before and after decompression. Indeed, the pressure difference is the dynamic force in the change in the pore size with time. The rate of change of pore size is thus proportional to the pressure discrepancy between the inside of the pore and the external medium.
