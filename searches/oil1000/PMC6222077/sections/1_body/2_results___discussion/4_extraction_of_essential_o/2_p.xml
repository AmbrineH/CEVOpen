<p id="p0085" class="p">The steam explosion pretreatments of orange peels were performed in a pilot plant. The hypothesis was to reduce time and increase the yield of essential oil using higher pressure and also explosion process, compared to the traditional hydro-distillation method. In this work, a central composite experimental design was applied to investigate the effect of the total time (t) and pressure (P) as independent parameters as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The essential oil extraction yields were considered as the main response parameter. These parameters were appropriate to represent respectively mechanical and thermal aspects of steam explosion process. Then, the performance of two methods was compared.
