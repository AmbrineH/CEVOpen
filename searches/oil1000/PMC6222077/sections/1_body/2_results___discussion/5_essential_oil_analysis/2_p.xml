<p id="p0100" class="p">Citrus peel oils are characterized by complex mixtures containing mostly terpenes as well as oxygen-containing compounds. For most citrus fruits, peel oils consist almost exclusively in the form of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other aliphatic hydrocarbons. Limonene is a clear, colorless liquid hydro-carbon classified as a cyclic monoterpene, and was the major component in oil of citrus fruit peels and it used as a functional index of ripeness in GC-MS analyses.</p>
