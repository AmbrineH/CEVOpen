 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2009</xref>), limonene was observed as the main constituent (77.49 %) in the peel oil of sweet orange, followed by myrcene (6.27 %), α-farnesene (3.64 %) and γ-terpinene (3.34 %). The main compounds in C. sinensis from Uganda and Rwanda were limonene (87.9 and 92.5 %), myrcene (2.4 and 2.0 %), α-pinene (0.5 and 2.4 %) and linalool (1.2 and 0.9 %) (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Njoroge et al., 2009</xref>). In every oil, limonene, α-pinene, sabinene and α-terpinene were the major compounds (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Njoroge et al., 2005</xref>). As shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, in essential oil, extraction of hydro-distillation had 13 compounds, including 86.05% hydro-carbon monoeters and 0.2% non-terpene compounds such as aliphatic hydro-carbons, aldehydes, and esters. The main ingredient in this essential oil was limonene 77.39%, myrcene 6.08%, and linalool 5.13 % in 16.75, 15.61 and 18.09 (min) in RT (Retention time) respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In essential oil, the extraction of steam explosion (10 bars, 34 min) had 10 compounds, which accounts for 97.8% of the total essential oil, was identified. This organic oil contains 94.49% hydrocarbon monoterpenes and 0.20% non-terpene compounds such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and esters. The main ingredients in monoterpene: Limonene 89.13%, Myrcene 3.14%, and Nonane 2.0% in 8.40, 7.28, and 4.85 (min) in RT (Retention time), respectively (
