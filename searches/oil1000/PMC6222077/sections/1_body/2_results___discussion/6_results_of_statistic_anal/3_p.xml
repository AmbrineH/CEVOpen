 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The ANOVA results isolated from the predictive model display that the main linear effects due to individual control factors such as pressure, time coded as P, T respectively, was all significant variables, the observed P-values &lt;0.05 in the numerical analysis. The regression equation for the accurate prediction of the values of the dependent variable is used as follows:
 <disp-formula id="fd1" class="disp-formula">
  <label class="label">(1)</label>Y = 0.159 + 0.757 X
  <sub class="sub">1</sub> + 0.316 X
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>
