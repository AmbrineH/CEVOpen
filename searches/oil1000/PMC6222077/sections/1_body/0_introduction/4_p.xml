<p id="p0020" class="p">Through the use of steam to mediate the extraction, it is possible to hold little conditions and gain better extraction. Steam explosion is a valuable and important technology to open up the biomass fibers, to enhance the healing of waste and different useful compounds from plants. The steam contacts a admixture and targets the substance(s) which has the high boiling point. The steam carries the desired substance(s) into another vessel through a condenser. The product, i.e. the mixture of hot vapors will, if let to pass through a cooling system (vacuumed tank), condense to form a liquid in which the oil and water include two separate layers (

The organic part may be an essential oil and other volatile compounds. This process subjects the product to fast transition from high steam pressure to hoover. This transition induces a quick evaporation of water and unstable compounds. It is also discussed as pretreatment procedure for the production of solid biofuel pellets to increase the calorific value and to improve the pelletizing properties of the biomass (
