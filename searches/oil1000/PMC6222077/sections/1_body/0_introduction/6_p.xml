<p id="p0030" class="p">The principle of this work was to get better an efficient process for extraction of essential oil from orange peel through a thermo-mechanical extraction technique developed in steam explosion process. This process is based by subjecting the product to a fast transition from the high steam strain chamber to a vacuum tank. For such products as citrus peels, the purpose became a upkeep of perfume coupled to an alveolate texture of the dried product. So, this technique used for the separation of essential oil from the solid material. An integrated technique for steam extraction accompanied via volatiles sampling and analysis from the essential oils of the citrus peels become explored. There have been two situations to overcome in the extraction from solid plant resources: that of releasing the essential oils from a solid matrix and letting it diffuse out efficiently in a manner that can be scaled-up to commercial volumes. In the direction of this give up, the impact of various parameters, such as pressure and extraction time at the extraction yield was investigated and the experimental outcomes display that all of these time, were significant parameters affecting yield. In addition, extraction of essential oil of drying peels was approved using hydro-distillation and their performance was compared to the steam explosion. The quality and comparison of its content were then based on the effect of test variables validated by GC-MS analysis.</p>
