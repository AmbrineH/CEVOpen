<p id="p0025" class="p">In this work, we investigated that processing by steam explosion increase the total diffusivity of the liquid in peels and improve the supply of the liquid in the citrus peels. The essential oil removal based on this research is an appealing substitute to typical techniques of essential oil extraction, such as hydro-distillation or isolation with solvents. Moreover, in comparison to the steam explosion and hydro-distillation, the quick time contact between peels and the heated zones of equipment avoids the loss and degradation of unstable and thermolabile compounds (
