<p id="p0135" class="p">In order to recover wastes from citrus processing, a thorough study was carried out on dried orange peels. It is significant to note that the natural organization of some plants such as citrus peels prevents an easy essential oil extraction. We first extracted the essential oils hydro-distillation and steam explosion. The extraction performed by hydro-distillation showed that mechanical process, in this case grinding, was necessary. Therefore, in the steam explosion mechanical (illustrated by the pressure) and thermal (illustrated by the steaming time t) processes can be combined for this specific material. Pre-treatment by the steam explosion can improve extraction yields and kinetics. The swelling of the cells enabled a improved kinetic extraction in conditions of diffusivity and starting accessibility. Investigations with a steam explosion at industrial scale equipment could be realized for industry tests. This process can have a lot of potential as a supportable alternative for the industry since it allows recovering citrus by-products. In addition to this study compared a mathematic model based on single plate particle description to predict the behavior of steam explosion and hydro-distillation process.</p>
