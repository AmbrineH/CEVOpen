<p id="Par33" class="p">The composition of the ROEO is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> (percentage of each compound, Retention Time (RT) and Retention Index (RI)). Thirty-six compounds, corresponding to 99.9% of the total oil, were identified in the ROEO, according to their elution order on a DB-5MS column. ROEO contained a complex mixture of compounds. In fact, monoterpene hydrocarbons, with 62.28%, were the most important classes of compounds present in ROEO (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Other classes, oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, were also found in smaller amounts, 21.72% and 12.18%, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The remaining compounds were identified in traces. The major components of ROEO were 1,8-cineole (23.56%), camphene (12.78%), camphor (12.55%), β pinene (12.3%), γ-terpinene (7.56%) and caryophyllene oxide (5.02%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
