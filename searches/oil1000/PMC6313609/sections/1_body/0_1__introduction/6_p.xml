<p class="p">In this review, we discuss the efficacy of volatiles (single compounds) and essential oils (EOs, group of compounds) produced by plants to control food-borne bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria</italic>) and fruit pathogens (mainly 
 <italic class="italic">Botrytis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum</italic>) on extending the shelf life of small fruits, such as strawberries (
 <italic class="italic">Fragaria</italic> Ã— 
 <italic class="italic">ananassa</italic> Duch), raspberries (
 <italic class="italic">Rubus</italic> spp.), blueberries (
 <italic class="italic">Vaccinium</italic> spp.) and grapes (
 <italic class="italic">Vitis vinifera</italic> L.). We also provide insight into their in vitro, in vivo (in storage) and In situ (in the field) applications, and their mechanisms of action. A summary of the papers reviewed is presented in
