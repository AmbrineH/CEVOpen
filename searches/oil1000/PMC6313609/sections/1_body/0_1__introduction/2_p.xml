<p class="p">Standard small fruit production practices discourage growers from washing fruits after harvest and during storage. This may contribute to the buildup of food-borne bacteria and may pose a food safety risk to consumers since small fruits are eaten fresh. Also, small fruits have a very short shelf life due to their susceptibility to spoilage pathogens, physiological disorders and mechanical injury [
