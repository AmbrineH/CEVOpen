<p class="p">Six and nine-carbon volatiles are produced in plant tissues in response to wounding in LOX (liposygenase) and HPL (hydroperoxide lyase) pathways. In addition to their role in aroma biosynthesis, products of LOX and HPL pathways, have antimicrobial and antifungal activities and may have a role in plant-pathogen interactions. Some have also shown a stimulatory effect on some pathogenic fungi. In
