Essential oil treated fruits were found to have higher amounts of sugars, flavonoids, anthocyanins, organic acid and phenolic compounds. The increase in phenolic content may have led to increased oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and decreased fruit spoilage in essential oil treated strawberries [
