<p class="p">The reviewed articles suggest that most of the essential oils do not leave off-flavors or off-odors on intact fruits at the minimum inhibitory concentrations, especially when stored fruits finish their ripening process. However, there is variation between fruit species and cultivars and each commodity has to be tested individually. For example, Neri et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], reported that stone fruits were more sensitive to (E)-hex-2-enal injury than pome fruits and showed off-flavor, probably because they absorb more (E)-hex-2-enal than pome fruits.
