 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] reported strawberry weight loss and other side effects by (E)-hex-2-enal. Walter et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported excessive water loss from detached grape branches (in the laboratory, but not in the field) exposed to thyme and massoialactone, and phytotoxicity on grape flowers in the field. Also, incorporation of bergamot essential oil in chitosan coating resulted in brown-colored grapes during storage [
