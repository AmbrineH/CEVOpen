<p class="p">Very few studies have reported on the sensory characteristics of fruits treated with essential oils. Neri et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] reported off-odors in peach and nectarine fruits treated with (E)-hex-2-enal described as a “green” (leafy) and “butyric” aroma. However, off-odors decreased during ripening and nothing was perceived after ripening. No fruit off-odors were observed in peach and nectarine fruits treated with carvacrol or citral. Aloui et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] reported complete absence of off-flavors and off-odors in dates treated with citrus essential oils. Serrano et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] treated cherries with eugenol, thymol or menthol and reported no sensory effects. However, cherries treated with eucalyptol generated off-flavors. Prasad &amp; Stadelbacher [
 <xref rid="B55-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], reported that acetaldehyde treated strawberries did not show any off-flavor at a concentration of 1%, but showed off-flavor at 4%.
