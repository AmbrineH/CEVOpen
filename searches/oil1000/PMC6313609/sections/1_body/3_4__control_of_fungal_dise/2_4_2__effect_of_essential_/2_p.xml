<p class="p">Essential oils have also been tested on grape diseases. In a laboratory study, Walter et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] found that EOs from clove (
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry</italic>), thyme, and massoialactone (derived from the bark of the tree 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptocarya massoia</italic> R.Br.) significantly reduced necrotic lesions on grape leaves caused by 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> when treated with thyme, and massoialactone. In a separate study, Valero et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] showed that thymol or eugenol (volatile from clove) reduced the loss of sensory quality and microbial spoilage of grape in modified atmosphere storage.
