<p class="p">In this review, the efficacy of essential oils (plant-based multi-compounds) and single compound volatiles was discussed in in vitro, in vivo (in storage) and In situ (in the field) conditions. Despite the importance of fresh fruits food safety, there are not many research articles on the effectiveness of essential oils to control bacteria populations on small fruits, which suggests the need for research in this area. Many research articles discussed the positive effects of volatiles and essential oils in in vitro conditions on media-grown fungal populations with a large variation in their efficacy and their minimum inhibitory concentrations. Most of these variations were related to the vapor pressure of volatiles. </p>
