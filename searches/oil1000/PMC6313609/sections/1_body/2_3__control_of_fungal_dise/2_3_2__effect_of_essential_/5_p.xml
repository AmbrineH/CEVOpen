 <italic class="italic">Capsicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Allium</italic> genera were the most effective and inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> spore germination after 48 and 24 hours, respectively. Among 49 essential oils tested, red thyme (

 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon martini</italic> (Roxb.) Will. Watson), clove buds (
 <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry</italic>), and cinnamon leaf (
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> Blume) greatly inhibited germination of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> spores at the lowest concentration tested (0.78% dilution; initial concentration was not provided). The essential oils with high antifungal activity and the highest frequency were: cineole, limonene, α-pinene, β-myrcene, camphor and β-pinene [
