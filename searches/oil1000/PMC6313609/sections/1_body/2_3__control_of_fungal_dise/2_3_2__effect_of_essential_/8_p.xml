<p class="p">Bhaskara Reddy et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] reported that, there is a significant difference between the antifungal activity of two clones of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> (Laval-1 and Laval-2) against two strawberry storage pathogens (
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus stolonifer</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic>). Oil from Laval-2 clones showed higher antifungal activity in vitro and decay control action in vivo which is mainly due to its higher carvacrol, thymol and linalool contents. Lemongrass oil reduced germ tube length and spore germination in 
 <italic class="italic">R. stolonifer</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Colletotrichum coccodes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> [
