<p class="p">To our knowledge, only one study reported the application of slow-release hexanal in postharvest fungal control in small fruits. To develop a controlled release mechanism, hexanal was incorporated into a polymer (Î²-cyclodextrin) and then evaluated in vitro against 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. alternata</italic>. Hexanal was fungistatic on all three pathogens and fungicidal on 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> was more responsive to hexanal than the other two pathogens. The data suggested that a slow-release compound provided a more uniform volatile dose during storage and was more effective in reducing postharvest diseases [
