<p class="p">Different concentrations of hexanal are effective against fungal growth. Caccioni et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] believed that, the actual vapor pressure rather than the concentration of volatiles determines their effectiveness. Therefore, the effectiveness of hexanal depends on its vapor pressure (effective concentration), its initial amount and the tested fungus. In essential oils, the antifungal activity strongly depends on the proportion of the individual components [
