<p class="p">The fact that different natural compounds have a different antifungal profile suggests that different modes of action exist. In human pathogens, several mechanisms of actions have been reported for antifungal activity of natural plant compounds. Sivakumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] reported that chalcones (aromatic ketons found in a few plant species) are able to disrupt fungal cell wall formation and cell lysis by inhibiting synthesis of the cell wall polysaccharide 1,3-beta-D-glucan. They can also interrupt cell division by inhibiting the conversion of tubulin into microtubules [
