<p class="p">Gardini et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] posited that hexanal is not soluble in water and therefore in the culture medium. However, Almenar et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] showed that PDA medium absorbed hexanal and prevented 
 <italic class="italic">A. alternata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> growth (3.0 and 3.3 Î¼L respectively). Therefore, if media can absorb henxanal, we hypothesize that fresh produce can also absorb small amounts of volatiles and extend their shelf life by extruding it.
