<p class="p">The saturation status of volatile compounds seems to also affect their efficacy with unsaturated compounds being more reactive than saturated ones. Hamilton-Kemp et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and Andersen et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] demonstrated that (E)-hex-2-enal (unsaturated aldehyde) was more effective against 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. alternata</italic> hyphal growth than hexanal (saturated aldehyde). Arroyo et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] showed that aldehydes ((E)-hex-2-enal and hexanal) which are less saturated than alcohols and esters, are more effective in fungal inhibition. In contrast, among the alcohols tested, (E)-hex-2-en-1-ol, and (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol which are less saturated than hexan-1-ol, showed lower antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> mycelial growth [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The reason could be due to a different reaction of 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> to volatiles compared to 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. alternata</italic> as was mentioned by Almenar et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Arroyo et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] studied the conidial cells of 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> treated with (E)-hex-2-enal by transmission electron microscopy. They observed that cell components were highly disorganized and cell wall and plasma membrane were disrupted, resulting in lysis of organelles and cell death.
