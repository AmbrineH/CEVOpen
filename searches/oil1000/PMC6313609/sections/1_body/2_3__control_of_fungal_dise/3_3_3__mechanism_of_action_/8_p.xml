<p class="p">Aldehydes, another group of volatiles, inhibit fungal cell division by reacting with, and inactivating sulfhydryl, the functional group involved in fungal cell division. Some aldehydes (such as cinnamaldehyde, citral and perillaldehyde) are good electron acceptors and form a charge transfer complex with electron donors present in fungal cells, thus interfering with fungal metabolism [
