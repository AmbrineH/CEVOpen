<p class="p">In this regard, Kulakiotu et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] reported cell protoplast secretion without initial cell wall disruption in mycelial hyphae of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> exposed to volatiles of grape (
 <italic class="italic">Vitis labrusca,</italic> cv. Isabella) resulting in cell wall deformation. Hyphae from the control treatment was healthy, possessing conidiophores with abundant conidia [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The mechanism of action of volatiles inhibiting hyphal growth and their effect on membranes needs further investigation. Thymol and carvacrol also showed antimicrobial activity against natural grape yeasts in red wines via damage to the membrane, leakage of cytoplasmic content and finally inhibition of erogosterol biosynthesis [
