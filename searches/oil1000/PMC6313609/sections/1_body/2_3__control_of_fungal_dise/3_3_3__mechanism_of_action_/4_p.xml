 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] reported that 
 <italic class="italic">C. acutatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cinerea</italic> responded similarly meaning hyphal growth was inhibited by aldehyde but not terpenes. However, they suggested that more cautious interpretation is needed as variable culture conditions and organism strain may affect the results.
