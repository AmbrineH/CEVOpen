<p class="p">Most of the studies on the application of natural volatiles and essential oils (EOs) to control foodborne pathogens, such as

 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-06-00104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] studied chitosan coating mixed with six different essential oils in vitro to control 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium digitatum</italic> in blueberries during storage. Carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde had high antimicrobial capacity and were selected for in vivo studies to control blueberry pathogens.
