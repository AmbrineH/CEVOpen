  <title class="title">Objective</title>
  <p class="p">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of rapeseed and linseed oil supplementations on performance and meat quality of lambs.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec class="sec">
  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p class="p">The experiment was conducted on 18 growing (100-day-old) lambs of 19.7±1.9 kg live weight, assigned to 3 groups of 6 animals each. Control lambs were fed meadow hay and concentrate alone. Experimental animals additionally received rapeseed or linseed oils at a dose of 50 g/d. The lambs were slaughtered at an average body weight of 35.7±0.5 kg.</p>

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p class="p">The dressing percentage was higher in lambs fed rapeseed oil. Total saturated fatty acids (SFA) and C15:0, C16:0, C17:0, C21:0, C24:0 were lower in 
   <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle (MLD) in lambs fed linseed oil. Supplementation of diet with linseed oil decreased concentrations of total monounsaturated fatty acids and C16:1, C17:1, C18:1 
   <italic class="italic">cis-9</italic> in MLD. The concentrations of 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and C18:3 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>, C20:5 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> in MLD were higher in lambs fed linseed oil than in other groups. Oils supplementation to diets resulted in increased concentration of C22:6 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> in MLD. The inclusion of linseed oil into the diet increased the contents of total PUFA, 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA and C18:3 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>, C20:5 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>, C22:6 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> in 
   <italic class="italic">semitendinosus</italic> muscle in comparison to control. A tendency towards a lower n:6/n:3 ratio in MLD was observed when lambs were supplemented linseed oil.

  <title class="title">Conclusion</title>
  <p class="p">The supplementation of linseed oil to diets seems to reduce the concentration of SFA and increase the concentration of 
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA. The 
   <italic class="italic">n-6</italic>/
   <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> ratio is an important nutritional factor, and its value has been favorably decreased below 2, thereby achieving an important target related to human health. Due to these changes carcass fatty acid profile was improved, and so enhanced lamb meat healthy properties.
