<p class="p">Linseed oil supplementation reduced SFA (C15:0, C16:0, C17:0, C21:0, C24:0) in MLD, but decreased only C24:0 concentration in MS. Linseed oil supplementation lowers SFA levels, especially C15:0, C16:0, and C17:0, which is desirable, because this FA is the major hypercholesterolemic FA and it is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes [

 <xref rid="b23-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], decreased SFA in muscles of ruminants fed linseed oil in the ration was presumably caused by 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> synthesis inhibition by a higher percentage of exogenous FA in the metabolic pool. Additionally, SFA reduction in muscles derived from lambs fed linseed oil may also reflect an incomplete biohydrogenation process, as an effect of the high consumption of unprotected fats rich in linolenic acid. Czauderna et al [
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] reported a reduction in the concentration of SFA in lamb 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">biceps femoris</italic> muscles after supplementing control diet with linseed oil. These authors suggested that the oil stimulated peroxidation damage and/or catabolism of FA. Our results are consistent with those of Gallardo et al [
 <xref rid="b22-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], who observed a greater decrease in C15:0, C16:0, C17:0, and C24:0 concentrations in intramuscular fat of lambs sucking ewes and receiving diets supplemented with linseed oil than in the control animals. On the other hand, Ebrahimi et al [
 <xref rid="b13-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] did not find significant changes in SFA concentration in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of goats fed diet with different levels of linseed oil.
