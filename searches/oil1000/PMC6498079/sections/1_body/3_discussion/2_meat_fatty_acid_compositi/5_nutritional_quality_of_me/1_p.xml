<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> and PUFA/SFA ratios are used to evaluate the nutritional value of fat for human consumption. The n:6/n:3 ratio is strongly dependent on the FA profile of the ration fed to ruminants. This ratio is particularly beneficial in the meat of ruminants that consume forages or oilseed with an increased C18:3 content [
 <xref rid="b2-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Lowering the 
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic>/n:3 coefficient in food production has been recommended to prevent or modulate certain human diseases, and it should range between 1 and 4 [
 <xref rid="b4-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Our results were within this range, but the n:6/n:3 ratio found in MLD and MS was the lowest when lambs were fed linseed oil. These results are consistent with findings of Jer√≥nimo et al [
 <xref rid="b28-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], who reported that the n:6/n:3 ratio in MLD of lambs was significantly decreased when dietary sunflower oil was replaced with linseed oil. In the group with linseed oil, 59.55% of total 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA were long chain 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA (C20:3, C20:5, and C22:6). Ebrahimi et al [
 <xref rid="b13-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] believed that this could be important considering that health benefits of 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA are predominantly associated with long chain 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA, as C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> metabolism is restricted in humans.
