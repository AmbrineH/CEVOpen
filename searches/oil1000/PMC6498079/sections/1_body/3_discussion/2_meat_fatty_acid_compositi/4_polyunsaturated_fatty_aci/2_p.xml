<p class="p">In our experiment, there was a decrease in the amounts of C20:3

 <xref rid="b29-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], this could be explained by the lower total FA concentration in the grass-based diet, allowing long chain phospholipid FA to dominate total lipids. Hence, it cannot be precluded that in our study the amount of total FA in meadow hay varied, all the more that lamb fattening lasted more than 50 days.
