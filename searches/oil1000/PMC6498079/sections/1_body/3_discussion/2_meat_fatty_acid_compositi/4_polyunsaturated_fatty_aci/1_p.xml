<p class="p">Lipids in vegetable oils are characterized by a high content of USFAs. Feeding vegetable oils, such as linseed, rapeseed or fish oils decreases SFA concentration in meat and increases the content of valuable PUFA especially ALA, EPA, DHA. Feeding strategies that induce a decrease in saturated lipids and an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> FA of intramuscular fat would improve the value of lamb meat. Conversion capacity of C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> to health-promoting long chain 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA is limited in humans [
 <xref rid="b2-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], which reinforce the significance of its dietary supply. The increase in the concentration of long chain 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA coincided with increase in dietary C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> concentration of linseed oil rations. This pattern was consistent with other trials where lambs were fed oils rich in C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> [
 <xref rid="b28-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="b13-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Lambs fed diet containing linseed oil accumulated a significantly higher amount of total 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA in their muscles than lambs fed other diets. Long chain 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA in muscles are metabolic products of C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>. Competition between C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> and C18:2 
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic> for desaturation and elongation enzymes may affect the conversion to long chain derivatives, while the high concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA is likely due to the preference of these enzymes for C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>. On the other hand, Bessa et al [
 <xref rid="b12-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] and Gallardo et al [
 <xref rid="b22-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] showed that diet supplementation with linseed oil, high in C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>, was coupled with decreased amounts of long chain 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA in 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus thoracis</italic> and intramuscular fat, suggesting an inhibition of C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> metabolism. Bessa et al [
 <xref rid="b12-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] explained that this inhibition could have been caused by the repression of gene expression mediated by linolenic acid.
