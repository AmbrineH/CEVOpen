<p class="p">Ruminant meat is an important dietary component of human diets. Lamb and beef meat have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases due to their high content of saturated fatty acid (SFA) [
 <xref rid="b1-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The formation of large SFA is a result of the biohydrogenation process in the rumen during which bacteria convert unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) to SFA. So, the fatty acids (FA) occurring in the rumen are highly saturated and take part in the absorption as well as deposition of the fat in muscles. Nevertheless, such meat may be also a good dietary source of some nutrients with health benefits, including certain FA, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAâ‰¥C20) as well as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers. In addition, in a review by Chikwanha et al [
