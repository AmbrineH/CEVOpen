<p class="p">Some nutritional aspects, for example FA profile of the ra tion, lipid supplementation source, forage type as well as the forage/concentrate ratio in the diet are main driving factors of ruminant meat [
 <xref rid="b2-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In ruminants some sources of FA such as ground oilseeds [
 <xref rid="b8-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], whole oilseeds [
 <xref rid="b9-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="b10-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], extruded oilseeds [
 <xref rid="b11-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] have already been studied. It was shown that the FA profile and concentration of CLA in meat may be affected by the form of the provided lipid. However, experiments evaluating kinds of oils are scarce [
 <xref rid="b12-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="b13-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and the exact influence of particular form of fat on FA profile of lamb and beef meat is limited.
