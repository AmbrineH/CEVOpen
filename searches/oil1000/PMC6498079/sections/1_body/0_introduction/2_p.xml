<p class="p">The decrease in SFA and increase of health-beneficial FA (PUFA and CLA) contents have been an important objective of ruminant meat studies. According to WHO/FAO [
 <xref rid="b4-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], the ratio of PUFA and SFA is a significant indicator for nutritional evaluation of fat, with a recommendation of about 0.40. Beneficial effects of PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA, C20:5 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, C22:6 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>) acids, include anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombotic actions [
 <xref rid="b5-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. It is essential to increase the consumption of EPA and DHA in human diets, because the synthesis of these FAs from dietary Î±-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>) is very restricted.
