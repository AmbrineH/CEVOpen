Afterwards, non-carcass components, gastrointestinal tracts and viscera were removed. Selected internal organs (liver, heart, and kidneys) were weighted. Carcasses were kept at 4°C for 24 h and a simple dissection of their right halves was carried out. Thereafter, carcasses were split into commercial cuts, i.e. loin, shoulder and leg; selected cuts were weighted. The samples of
