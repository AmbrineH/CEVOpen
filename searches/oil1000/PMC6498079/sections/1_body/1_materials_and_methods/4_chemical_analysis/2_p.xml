<p class="p">Lipids from oils and muscles were extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1), according to Folch et al [
 <xref rid="b18-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. After filtration through a filter paper, 800 μL of filtrate was transferred into glass vials. Thereafter, vials were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen stream in a heating block at 50°C. The samples were saponified with 1.5 mL of 0.5 M KOH in methanol in a heating block at 75°C. Next, the samples were esterified with 3.0 mL of 4% solution of SOCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in methanol. Methyl esters were extracted with 1.0 mL of n-heptane and salted out with NaCl to separate the organic layer. Subsequently, 300 μL methyl esters were transferred into glass vials and 600 μL of n-heptane was added. The vials were kept at −30°C until fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) analyses. The FAME were separated and quantified using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame-ionisation detector (FID), injection port and a BPX70 fused silica capillary column (120 m ×0.25 mm i.d.×0.25 μm film thickness [SHIM-POL, Izabelin, Poland]). Helium was used as the carrier gas, operated at a constant pressure of 223.4 kPa and flow rate of 1 mL/min. Injector and FID temperatures were maintained at 200°C and 240°C, respectively. FAME profile was analysed using the temperature gradient programme in a 1-μL sample at a split ratio of 10:1, as described by Czauderna et al [
 <xref rid="b19-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The analysis started at 70°C for 4 min increasing at a rate of 12°C/min to 150°C, which was maintained for 6 min; then increased at 8°C/min to 168°C, maintained for 27 min and increased by 0.75°C/min to 190°C and maintained for 10 min; then increased again at a rate of 1.8°C to 210°C, maintained for 15 min; elevated at a rate of 6°C/min to 234°C, which was kept for 4 min and finally increased at a rate of 6°C/min to 236 and maintained for 20 min. FAME peaks were identified by comparison with Supelco 37 Component FAME Mix (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA) and CLA standard mix (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis MO, USA).
