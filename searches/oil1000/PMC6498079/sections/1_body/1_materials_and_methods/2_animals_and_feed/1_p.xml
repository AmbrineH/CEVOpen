<p class="p">The study was conducted on 18 growing (100-day-old) male Corridale lambs of 19.7±1.9 kg live weight. The animals were assigned to 3 groups of 6 lambs each (according to initial body weight) in a randomized complete block design. The animals were housed in individual pens on wheat straw with separate facilities for feeding. Control animals were fed a basal diet containing meadow hay, concentrate – crushed barley and soybean oilmeal and vitamin-mineral mixture (Polfamix - OK, Trouw Nutrition, Poland); experimental lambs were fed a basal ration and 5% rapeseed or linseed oils. Oils were stored out of direct sunlight at 4°C and supplements were mixed into the concentrate. Dietary compositions are given in

 <xref rid="t2-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Daily rations were offered in two equal portions at 8:00 and 16:00. The lambs had free access to water and blocks of salt containing microelements. Since animals were provided with a limited amount of feed, no orts were observed.
