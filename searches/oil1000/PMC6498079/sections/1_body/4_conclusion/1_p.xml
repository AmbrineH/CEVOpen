<p class="p">According to the results of the present study, FA profile in muscles was depended on oils supplemented to lamb diets. Additionally, the supplementation of linseed oil to diets seems to reduce the concentration of SFA and increase the concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA, particularly ALA, EPA, and DHA in meat. The 
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> ratio is an important nutritional factor, and its value has been favorably decreased below 2, thereby achieving an important target related to human health. Due to these changes carcass FA profile was improved, and so enhanced lamb meat healthy properties.
