The addition of rapeseed oil to the diets significantly decreased C15:1 concentration (p = 0.006) in MLD in comparison to control and linseed oil rations. Moreover, the addition of linseed oil to lamb diets significantly increased C24:1 contents (p = 0.003) in MS than in control and did not influence other MUFA (p&gt;0.100) (
