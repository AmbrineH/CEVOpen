<p class="p">The concentrations of ALA (p&lt;0.001), EPA (p = 0.010) and total 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA (p = 0.011) in MLD were significantly higher when linseed oil was provided in comparison to control and lambs fed rapeseed oil (
 <xref rid="t5-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). In turn, the content of C20:3 in MLD was significantly lower (p = 0.001) in animals fed linseed oil than in control ones. Oil supplementations to animal diets caused significantly increased concentration of DHA (p = 0.018) in MLD when compared to the control diet. The addition of linseed oil to the diets significantly increased concentrations of ALA (p&lt;0.001), EPA (p = 0.007) as well as total 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> PUFA (p = 0.001) and sum of PUFA (p = 0.004) in MS compared to control and rapeseed oil groups (
 <xref rid="t6-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Further, the addition of oils to the rations significantly increased DHA concentration in MS (p = 0.008).
