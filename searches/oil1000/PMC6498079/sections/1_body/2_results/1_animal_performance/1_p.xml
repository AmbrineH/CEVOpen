As expected, crude fat content and feed unit of maintenance and meat production were higher for oil-supplemented than control ration. Furthermore, the contents of CP, crude ash and starch as well as NDF and ADF (as g/kg DM) were lower for oil-supplemented than control diet. Daily DM intake was higher when oils were supplemented in comparison to the control ration (1.05 vs 1.00 kg DM/d).
