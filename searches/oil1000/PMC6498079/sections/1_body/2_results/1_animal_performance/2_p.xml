<p class="p">Lambs in different oil supplementation treatments were similar in terms of ADG (p = 0.816) and feed conversion ratio (p = 0.982) (
 <xref rid="t3-ajas-18-0482" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Significantly higher (p = 0.039) dressing percentage (DP) and a tendency towards increased hot carcass and right half carcass weights (p = 0.100 and p = 0.060, respectively) were recorded in lambs fed the rapeseed oil diet. The weights of carcass components, i.e. loin (p = 0.718), shoulder (p = 0.472), and leg (p = 0.378), did not change significantly when oils were supplemented.
