 <italic class="italic">P. dodecandra</italic> showed its ability for treatment of ascariasis, gonorrhea, malaria, rabies, jaundice, eczema, and it was also used as abortifacient [

According to our literature survey, many phytochemical studies on this plant have been performed, and a type of triterpenoid saponins, which had the molluscicidal activities and were named lemmatoxins after Aklilu Lemma, an Ethiopian scientist, were the major compounds isolated [

 <italic class="italic">P. dodecandra</italic> in Ethiopia, that differed in gender or location. Therefore, the present study will focus on the chemical composition of aromas and essential oils from this important Ethiopian medicinal plant, and the antimicrobial properties of essential oils will also be studied.
