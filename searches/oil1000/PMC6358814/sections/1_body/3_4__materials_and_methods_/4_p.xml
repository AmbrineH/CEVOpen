<p class="p">GC-MS analysis of the oils and aromas were carried out using an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), fitted with a HP-INNOWax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). This chromatograph was coupled to a mass spectrometer-detector (model Agilent 5973N, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Gas chromatography condition: the temperature was programmed at 50 °C for the first three minutes, increased at a rate of 5 °C/minute to 180 °C, then at a rate of 10 °C/minute to 250 °C and held isothermal at 250 °C for the next ten minutes; The injector temperature was 250 °C; The injected volume was 1 μL for oil; Helium was used as carrier gas; Flow rate was 0.8 mL/min with a split ratio of 2:1 (aromas) or 10:1 (oils); Mass spectrometry condition: EI ionization mode, 70 eV, scan range 20–450 amu, ion source temperature was 230 °C, quadrupole mass spectrometer temperature was 150 °C. Individual components were identified by matching their mass spectra with those of the spectrometer data base (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA; Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, USA). For quantification purposes, relative area percentages were used without the use of correction factors.</p>
