<p class="p">The aromas of plant leaves were captured by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) using a 75 μm carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) fiber. For this purpose, powdered leaves were loaded into a 20 mL vial. After 40 min of exposure under 85 °C, the fiber containing the extracted aromas was then injected into the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and kept in the injector for 3 min under 250 °C.</p>
