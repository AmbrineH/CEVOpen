<p class="p">In the present study, we investigated the chemical composition of aromas and essential oils of four 
 <italic class="italic">P. dodecandra</italic> samples which differed in collection place or gender, and a comparison of the essential oil and aroma components between the four plant samples was also performed. This analysis revealed that aldehydes and ketones, such as sulcatone, 2-nonanone, benzaldehyde and phytone, are the major components in the aromas. It also indicated that phytone, phytol and hexadecanoic acid were prominent in the essential oils. Such a difference in chemical composition is probably due to the different extraction methods used for the aromas and essential oils. It should also be mentioned that only six terpenes, which are usually prominent in most of the aromas or essential oils of other plants, were detected in the four 
 <italic class="italic">P. dodecandra</italic> samples.
