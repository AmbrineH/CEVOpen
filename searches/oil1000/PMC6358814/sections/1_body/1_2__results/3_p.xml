<p class="p">Sixty components in total were identified from the four essential oils, and only three compounds (phytone, pentacosane and hexadecanoic acid) were identical. This indicates that the four plant samples were widely different. Main constituents of essential oil of sample P-1 (Arebi endod) were phytol (21.56%) and hexadecanoic acid (23.87%), among other nineteen components comprising 64.61% of the total oil. Ten and twenty-two components were identified from the essential oils of sample P-2 (female) and P-3 (male), comprised 66.48% and 69.64% of the total essential oils, respectively, and only six components are same for these two plant samples. The major components of essential oils are phytone (21.23%) and hexadecanoic acid (20.07%) for sample P-2, and phytone (17.41%) and phytol (26.29%) for sample P-3. Thirty-six compounds, comprised 67.98% of the total essential oil, were detected from sample P-4, and main constituents of the essential oil of sample P-4 were (+)-spathulenol (9.07%) and hexadecanoic acid (13.54%).</p>
