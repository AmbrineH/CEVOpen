<p class="p">A total of ninety-one constituents were detected from all the four aromas samples, and only six components: sulcatone, benzaldehyde, β-ionone, β-ionone epoxide, phytone and dihydro- actinidiolide were common to all of them. This means that the four plant samples are widely different. Thirty compounds were identified from the aromas of sample P-1 (Arebi endod), comprised 93.92% of the total aromas, with predominance of aldehydes and ketones (49.63%). Benzaldehyde (25.99%) and benzeneethanol (17.11%) were the main constituents identified. Plant sample P-2 (female) and P-3 (male) were collected from the same place and they are just different in gender. Sample P-3 was given the local name ‘mekan endod’, which means it is the endod that can’t give seed or fruit. Thirty-seven and forty-two components were identified from the aromas of sample P-2 and P-3, which comprised 87.12% and 88.37% of the total aromas, respectively, and twenty-four components are same for these two samples. Aldehydes and ketones are predominant in both sample P-2 (78.26%) and P-3 (54.25%). Plant sample P-4 was also given the local name ‘mekan endod’, the same as sample P-3, but they differed in collection site. Forty-six components were identified from the aromas of sample P-4, which comprised 94.01% of the total aromas, and acetic acid (11.27%), benzyl alcohol (6.21%) and 3-methylbutanoic acid (5.31%) were the major constituents. Comparison between sample P-3 and P-4, which are same in gender but different in collection place, showed that only fourteen components were same in the two plant samples, which comprised 30% of the total forty-six compounds of aroma of sample P-4.</p>
