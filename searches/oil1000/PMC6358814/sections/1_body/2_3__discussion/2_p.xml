<p class="p">The presence or absence of constituents in the aromas or essential oils composition is difficult to explain. Phytone, a dominant and behaviorally active component in male orchid bee fragrances [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], was found to be the only compound that existed in both aromas and essential oils of all four plant samples. 2-Tridecanone, 2-tetradecanone, Î²-ionone, phytone and phytol were detected in both the aroma and essential oil of sample P-3, and only phytone was identified from aroma and essential oil of sample P-2. One sesquiterpene, (+)-spathulenol, and other ten components were common in both the aroma and essential oil of sample P-4. The differences in chemical composition between the aromas and essential oils may be due to the different extraction methods (HS-SPME and steam distillation). Compared with steam distillation, HS-SPME is obviously better owing to more components being extracted, higher retrieval matching and sensitivity, and it can be used for the comparison between same plants of different place or plants from the same genus.
