  <p id="Par1" class="p">Chagas Disease caused by 
   <italic class="italic">Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection, is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases (NTD), without an effective therapy for the successful parasite eradication or for the blocking of the disease’s progression, in its advanced stages. Due to their low toxicity, wide pharmacologic spectrum, and potential synergies, medicinal plants as 
   <italic class="italic">Lippia alba</italic>, offer a promising reserve of bioactive molecules. The principal goal of this work is to characterize the inhibitory properties and cellular effects of the Citral and Carvone 
   <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> chemotype essential oils (EOs) and their main bioactive terpenes (and the synergies among them) on 
   <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> forms.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">Twelve 
   <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> EOs, produced under diverse environmental conditions, were extracted by microwave assisted hydrodistillation, and chemically characterized using gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry. Trypanocidal activity and cytotoxicity were determined for each oil, and their major compounds, on epimastigotes (Epi), trypomastigotes (Tryp), amastigotes (Amas), and Vero cells. Pharmacologic interactions were defined by a matrix of combinations among the most trypanocidal terpenes (limonene, carvone; citral and caryophyllene oxide). The treated cell phenotype was assessed by fluorescent and optic microscopy, flow cytometry, and DNA electrophoresis assays.

  <p id="Par3" class="p">The 
   <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> EOs displayed significant differences in their chemical composition and trypanocidal performance (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0001). Citral chemotype oils were more trypanocidal than Carvone EOs, with Inhibitory Concentration 50 (IC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of 14 ± 1.5 μg/mL, 22 ± 1.4 μg/mL and 74 ± 4.4 μg/mL, on Epi, Tryp and Amas, respectively. Limonene exhibited synergistic interaction with citral, caryophyllene oxide and Benznidazole (decreasing by 17 times its IC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub>) and was the most effective and selective treatment. The cellular analysis suggested that these oils or their bioactive terpenes (citral, caryophyllene oxide and limonene) could be inducing 
   <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> cell death by an apoptotic-like mechanism.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">EOs extracted from 
   <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> Citral chemotype demonstrated significant trypanocidal activity on the three forms of 
   <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> studied, and their composition and trypanocidal performance were influenced by production parameters. Citral, caryophyllene oxide, and limonene showed a possible induction of an apoptotic-like phenotype. The best selective anti-
   <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> activity was achieved by limonene, the effects of which were also synergic with citral, caryophyllene oxide and benznidazole.
