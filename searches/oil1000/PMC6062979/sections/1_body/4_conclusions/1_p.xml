<p id="Par100" class="p">In this work, a range of growth, plant, and extraction parameters were found to significantly influence the chemical composition and trypanocidal activity of essential oils isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> Citral and Carvone chemotypes. 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> Citral chemotype oils, extracted under known and controlled conditions, presented significant trypanocidal activity on three cyclic 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> forms: epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and amastigotes. Assays using pure solutions of the main terpenes that constitute 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> EOs, confirmed an association among parasitological activity and the presence of citral and caryophyllene oxide. Tests using EOs extracted from Carvone chemotype (rich in carvone and limonene), and their most important components, established an antagonistic relationship between carvone and limonene in their trypanocidal performance. Nevertheless, in this study, the best anti-
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic>, and most selective, activity was achieved by limonene. Citral, caryophyllene oxide, and limonene exhibited the induction of a possible apoptotic-like phenotype. In the synergistic interaction tests, limonene also improved the trypanocidal performance of citral, caryophyllene oxide, and even BNZ, on the three parasitic forms studied. The best synergic terpene activity was displayed by the limonene and caryophyllene oxide combination. These results should be confirmed by further pre-clinical studies and could be of interest for the development of alternative and adjuvant treatments improving the tolerance and parasitological efficacy, and broadening the spectrum of the effects, of the current conventional therapies for late phases of Chagas Disease. In such research, 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> EOs represent a renewable source for commercial exploitation of these terpenes.
