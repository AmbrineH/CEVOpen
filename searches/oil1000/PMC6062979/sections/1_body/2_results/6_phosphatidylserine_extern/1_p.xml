<p id="Par87" class="p">A flow cytometry analysis was carried out to determine the general mechanism of cell death. As expected, untreated Epi showed high viability rates (99.7%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>), whereas the various terpene treatments (48 h at 2xIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) caused high percentages of cell death, with 95.7, 89.2, 78.4, and 95.9% for cayophyllene oxide, limonene, citral, and the combination limonene:BNZ, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0001). No treatment showed statistically significant levels of negative SYTOX + positive Annexin V (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05), except the apoptosis positive control (15 day-old parasite culture) (13.6%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5f</xref>). On the other hand, all the treated cultures displayed high percentages of positive SYTOX and positive Annexin V. These results suggest a possible trigger of a late apoptosis mechanism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
