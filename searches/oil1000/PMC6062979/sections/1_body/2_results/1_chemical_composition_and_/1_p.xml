<p id="Par78" class="p">This work studied the trypanocidal properties of 12 EOs isolated from Citral and Carvone 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> chemotypes produced under an array of standardized conditions for planting, collecting and extracting of the vegetal material. A typical chromatographic profile for each chemotype essential oil, obtained by mass spectra and linear retention indices, is showed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">b</xref>, for Carvone and Citral oils, respectively. The corresponding peak assignment of these chromatograms are listed in Table
