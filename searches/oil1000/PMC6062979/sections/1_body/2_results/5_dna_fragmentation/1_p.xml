<p id="Par86" class="p">A possible endonuclease activation triggered by studied compounds (oils, terpenes or their combinations) was assessed through agarose gel DNA electrophoresis and TUNEL analyses. DNA degradation was observed by band disappearance in agarose gel (data not shown) and confirmed through green fluorescence on nuclei and kinetoplasts from Epi forms treated for 48Â h with double doses at IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (2xIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of limonene, caryophyllene oxide, and the mix limonene:BNZ; with percentages of 94, 99, and 98, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). Non-significant fragmentation was observed on untreated Epi (Fig.
