 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic>, this monoterpene was selected as a fixed-compound of a pharmacological interaction matrix among terpenes and BNZ. This matrix was assembled taking the IC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>], all the evaluated interactions were found to be synergic on both extra and intracellular forms of the parasite (except limonene with carvone, with ΣFIC = 1.10 and 1.04, on Epi and Tryp, respectively) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows these pharmacological relations as isobolograms of the mean FIC of each combination. The highest synergy was exhibited by limonene/BNZ combinations (Epi: ΣFIC = 0.44; Tryp: ΣFIC = 0.42; Amas: ΣFIC = 0.58) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), with the best trypanocidal performance achieved by the 4xIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> limonene:½IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> BNZ mixture (4 times IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> limonene plus one half of the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of BNZ), which reduced by 14, 16, and 17 times the BNZ IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> on Amas, Epi, and Tryp, respectively. Despite its good performance, this combination also resulted in an increased cytotoxicity on Vero cells (ΣFIC = 0.54). On the other hand, limonene with caryophyllene oxide represented the second-best combination by anti-parasitic efficacy (Epi Σ FIC = 0.49; Tryp Σ FIC = 0.45; and Amas Σ FIC = 0.71), while offering an additional advantage of reduction of the individual cytotoxicity of each terpene on Vero cells (ΣFIC = 1.22) (Table
