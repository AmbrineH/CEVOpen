<p id="Par85" class="p">The morphological changes induced by the treatments studied (EOs, terpenes, or BNZ, and their combinations) were analyzed by optical and fluorescent microscopy using phase contrast, and nuclear specific (DAPI) and mitochondrial membrane potential (Mitotracker Red CMXRos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]) stains. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, some of the tested treatments induced significant changes on parasitic morphology such as: spherical cell conformation, reduced cytoplasmic volume (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>, DIC), mitochondrial membrane potential deplection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>, MitoTracker), and formation of a nuclear speckled/condensation pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>, DAPI). In one unique finding, the caryophyllene oxide treatment also caused a flagellum to be lost. Conversely, 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> cells treated with BNZ displayed cellular edema and loss of cellular membrane integrity, but with conserved mitochondrial energetic potential (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Under the same conditions, Vero host cells did not present visible morphological alterations (data not shown).
