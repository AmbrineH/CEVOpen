<p id="Par91" class="p">In this work, we tested the trypanocidal and cytotoxic activity of 12 EOs, derived from two different plant chemotypes (Citral and Carvone) of 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba,</italic> which were produced under controlled conditions of growth (geographic location, cultivation environment, and soil), plant parameters (age and part), material state (fresh or dry) and extraction conditions (time). These standardized procedures were prepared taking into consideration the recognized high phenotypical plasticity of the plant in response to genetic, environmental, and production parameters [
