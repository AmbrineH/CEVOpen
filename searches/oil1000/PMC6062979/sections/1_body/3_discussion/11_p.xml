<p id="Par98" class="p">It is important to add that the parasite cells treated for 48Â h with some of the studied compounds (A23 oil, citral, caryophyllene oxide, limonene, and the mixture of limonene and BNZ) evidenced typical characteristics of apoptosis, such as cytoplasmic blebbing, cell shrinkage, flagellum absence, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, condensation of the nuclear chromatin, and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Also, the treatment of parasites with caryophyllene oxide or limonene (alone, in combination, or with BNZ) led to positive results in TUNEL assays (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). Correspondingly, an impairment of membrane potential (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and the externalization of phosphatidylserine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) were observed on 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> cells treated with citral, limonene, and caryophyllene oxide. These results suggest a possible activation of an early apoptosis mechanism that rapidly progresses to late apoptosis (positive SYTOX plus positive Annexin V) accompanied by DNA fragmentation. In trypanosomatids like 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania donovani, T. brucei</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi,</italic> these same characteristics have been reported in parasites suffering calcium imbalance and oxidative stress (by ROS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>], mitochondrial enzyme knockdown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>], or treatment with sterols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. In these studies, the previously mentioned features were associated with a possible programmed cell death such as apoptosis or autophagy [
