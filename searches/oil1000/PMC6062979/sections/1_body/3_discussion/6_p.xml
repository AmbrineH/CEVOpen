<p id="Par93" class="p">With respect to citral, several studies on cancer and immune cell line models have demonstrated its interesting biological properties. As an anti-tumoral, this monoterpene exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects, in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] and this cell growth inhibition was ascribed to the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis pathways (through p53 activation triggered by an ROS increase) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. In addition, citral has also been described as anti-inflammatory agent. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, this terpene was found to suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory markers such as NLRP2 (NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 2), Interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-1β [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>], Tumoral Necrosis Factor (TNF) α [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>], as well as to activate the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) γ dependent-Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) promotor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that over a range of different cells, the expression of COX2 is regulated in a variety of ways; playing an important role in tumoral genesis, inflammation, development, and circulatory homeostasis. In these activated macrophages, citral also blocks the genic expression of the LPS-induced Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>] and, consequently, the production of Nitric Oxide (NO). It is thought that this inhibition could suppress transcriptional activation and the translocation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ƙB). These results suggest that citral is an anti-inflammatory agent whose effects could be associated with NF-ƙB suppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>], indicating that this compound may be a promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory conditions like Chagas Disease.
