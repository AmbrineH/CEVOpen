<p id="Par88" class="p">In Chagas Disease, the pathogen-specific treatments – such as BNZ – should be prescribed for acute cases and for younger patients with little or no evidence of established cardiomyopathy [

This absence of an association between parasite clearance by BNZ and the clinical progression of heart disease has been ascribed to both the restricted activity of the treatment in the inflammatory and fibrotic cardiomyopathy lesions, as well as the irreversibility of this damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Thus, alternative approaches for Chagas infection management should aim to control not only the parasite load, but also all the factors associated with cardiomyopathy progression (oxidative stress and immune effectors, among others) [
