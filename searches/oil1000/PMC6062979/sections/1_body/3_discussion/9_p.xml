<p id="Par96" class="p">Another major 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> terpene studied herein was limonene. This monoterpene is one of the main components of the Carvone chemotype oils. Due its beneficial pharmacological characteristics such as: low toxicity (used as food additive for decades) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>], high bioavailability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], and selective anti-tumoral effect on a variety of cancer cell lines (leukemia, lymphoma, prostate, hepatic, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and breast, among others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]); several research efforts have been undertaken with respect to this monoterpene. Interestingly, on a prostate cancer model, limonene caused apoptotic programmed cell death by the induction of a selective oxidative stress on tumoral cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. As for protozoa, cancer cells are highly vulnerable to cell death induced by pro-oxidant agents (such as limonene) due their high metabolism and their deficient antioxidant mechanisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. In this study, limonene was the best trypanocidal and most selective terpene with the lowest inhibitory doses (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 9.0, 28.7, and 41.8 μg/mL on Tryp, Amas, and Epi, respectively). However, this good performance was not replicated when 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> forms were treated with oils rich in carvone and limonene (
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> Carvone chemotype EOs displayed higher IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> levels on Epi = 88.2 μg/mL, Tryp = 44.9 μg/mL, and Amas &gt; 150 μg/mL) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Interestingly, carvone was the least effective trypanocidal terpene, with the lowest values of cell death percentage induction and highest IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). These results were associated with the strong antioxidant capability previously ascribed to this monoterpene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. Accordingly, a possible antagonism seems likely between limonene and carvone (which was present in the oil mixture in levels close to 42%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Pharmacological interaction tests confirmed that the presence of carvone in the 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> Carvone chemotype oils, impaired the limonene’s trypanocidal performance on 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> Tryp (ΣCIF: 1.04 μg/mL) and Epi (ΣCIF: 1.10 μg/mL) forms (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In further assays, limonene presented a synergistic pharmacological interaction with the other bioactive 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> terpenes (citral and caryophyllene oxide), and with BNZ, exhibiting ΣFIC values &lt; 0.8 μg/mL on the three parasite forms analyzed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In combination with BNZ, limonene caused a significant decrease of the BNZ-IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, by 14, 16, and 17 times on Amas, Epi, and Tryp, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>).
