 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> Epi (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> Epi/mL) and TDC (5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) in the exponential growth phase were plated in a 96-well standard microplate in LIT medium (at 28 °C) and in D-MEM medium (at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere), respectively. Both cultures were supplemented with 10% FBSi. For the trypanocidal assays, the EOs or their terpenes were added at varying concentrations (3.7 to 100 μg/mL) and incubated at the same culture conditions for 72 (Epi) or 24 h (Tryp). The growth inhibition was estimated by light microscopy through a differential count using the Trypan Blue (Gibco) dye exclusion technique. The results were expressed in terms of Inhibitory Concentration 50 (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) or the concentration at which parasite growth is inhibited by 50%. For Amas assays, a monolayer of Vero cells (3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cel/mL) was infected with TDC in a 1:3 cell:parasite ratio and incubated for 24 h until Amas development occurred. Then, these intracellular forms were exposed for 120 h to EOs or terpenes in a treatment applied in two doses (at 0 and 48 h), under the same conditions described above. Growth inhibition analysis was assessed in Giemsa-stained films using light microscopy to determine the infected and uninfected cell percentage in a total of 300 cells. Cells without treatment and those treated with BNZ were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.
