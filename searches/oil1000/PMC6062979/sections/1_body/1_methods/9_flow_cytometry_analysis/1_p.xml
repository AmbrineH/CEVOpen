<p id="Par76" class="p">For cell death characterization, an Annexin V/Dead with SYTOX® Green (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) kit was used following the procedure specified in the manufacturer’s instructions. The phosphatidylserine externalization was determined by employing a recombinant Annexin V conjugated to the Orange Fluorescent phycobiliprotein R-PE, and to the necrotic cells using SYTOX™ Green nucleic acid stain. Briefly, 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> Epi per mL were treated with 2xIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for 48 h, washed, and suspended in 1X Annexin-Binding Buffer. Next, R-PE Annexin V and SYTOX® Green Stain were added and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and 95% humidity, and analyzed in a FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer (provided by Dr. Marcos López from Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia), with 488 nm/575 nm Excitation/Emission filters for R-PE and 503 nm/524 nm Excitation/Emission filters for SYTOX.
