<p id="Par71" class="p">Vero cells (3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cel/mL) were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere and at 95% humidity for 24 h to ensure the formation of a confluent monolayer. After this time, the cells were treated with the EOs or their terpenes in four different concentrations (11.1, 33.3, 100, and 300 μg/mL). Thereafter, the lineages were incubated for 70 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere and re-incubated 2 more hours with WST-1 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), after which Optical Density (OD) measurements were analyzed by spectrophotometry. The cytotoxicity percentage was calculated using [(OD
 <sub class="sub">450nm</sub> Control – OD
 <sub class="sub">450nm</sub> treatment) / OD
 <sub class="sub">450nm</sub> treatment)] × 100. The results were expressed as Cytotoxic Concentration 50 (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>).
