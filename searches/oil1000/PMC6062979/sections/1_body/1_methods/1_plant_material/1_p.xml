<p id="Par67" class="p">In this study, specimens of the Citral and Carvone chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia alba</italic> (Miller) N. E. Brown (Verbenaceae) were planted in the National Research Center for Agroindustrialization of Aromatic Medical and Tropical species (CENIVAM, in Spanish) located in Bucaramanga, Santander, Colombia, at an altitude of 960 m above sea level. The formal identification of the plant specimens used in this study was provided by Prof. Jorge Luis Fernández Alonso and the vouchers were deposited at the Colombian National Herbarium (Universidad Nacional de Colombia) under Herbarium Codes COL480750 and COL512077, for Carvone and Citral chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic>, respectively. A range of environmental and production conditions were used in order to produce 76 EOs with possible diversity in their main compounds. In this regard, the vegetal material was grown, collected, and extracted under the following factors. 1) season: defined as dry (January to March, 26.3 °C temperature, with 68.9% relative humidity, and 1.05 mm/day precipitation) and rainy (April to November, mean temperature of 24.5 °C, relative humidity of 81.3%, and 4.13 mm of daily precipitation); 2) 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> chemotypes (53 from Carvone and 23 from Citral); 3) part of plant harvested (root, stem, fresh and mature leaves, and flowers); 4) vegetal material conditions (fresh and dry); and 5) extraction time (from 30 to 90 min).
