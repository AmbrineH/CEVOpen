<p id="Par73" class="p">A matrix of pharmacological interactions between limonene (the most selective terpene) and the other major EO terpenes was created for the three cyclic forms of 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi,</italic> using the fixed-ratio isobologram method, as described previously by Fivelman et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] with some modifications (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In the interaction matrix, the estimated IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for each terpene was used as fixed-value for the combinations. In addition, a mixture of limonene and BNZ was also evaluated.
