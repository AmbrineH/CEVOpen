<p id="Par69" class="p">The terpenes S (+) carvone, D (+) limonene, (−) caryophyllene oxide, and citral were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The reference medication BNZ (Radanil®, Roche) was donated by Santander’s State Secretary of Health, and purified by Dr. Leonor Yamile Vargas, from the Environmental Chemistry Program at Universidad Santo Tomás de Aquino (Bucaramanga). Concentrations ranging from 1.85 to 50 μg/mL were used for epimastigote (Epi) and amastigote (Amas) assays and 0.39 to 3.12 μg/mL for trypomastigote (Tryp) assays. The oils (at a density of 0.9 g/mL) and terpene stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO)), to get a 10% (

Working solutions (3.7 to 300 μg/mL) were diluted immediately prior to use with Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT, Becton Dickinson, FL, USA) media and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Life Technology, CA, USA) for
