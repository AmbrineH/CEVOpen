<p id="Par70" class="p">Vero lineage derived from African Green Monkey Kidney (Vero, ATCC CCL-81) was used for selectivity index determination and for Tryp and Amas production. These cells were grown on DMEM (Life Technology, CA, USA) media, pH: 7.4; supplemented with 10% of inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBSi), 1000 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin; and incubated at 37 °C with 90% humidity and a 5% CO

 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> I (TcI) SYLVIO-X10 strain, were donated by Dr. Marcos López-Casillas, from Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia and grown in LIT medium (Merck) supplemented with 10% FBSi, and incubated at 28 °C. The Trypomastigotes Derived from Cells (TDC) were obtained by infection of a confluent monolayer of Vero cells with 12 day-old stationary growth phase Epi and incubated under the same conditions described above for Vero cells.
