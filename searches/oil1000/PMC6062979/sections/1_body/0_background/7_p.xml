<p id="Par66" class="p">The principal goal of this work is to characterize the inhibitory properties and cellular effects of the Citral and Carvone 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> chemotype EOs and their main bioactive terpenes on 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and amastigotes cyclic forms. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was determined for each of these compounds, and possible pharmacologic interactions were defined by a matrix of combinations of the trypanocidal compounds (from Carvone chemotype: limonene and carvone; and from Citral chemotype: citral and caryophyllene oxide). The phenotype of the parasites and mammal cells treated with EOs or terpenes was followed by fluorescent and optic microscopy, flow cytometry, and DNA electrophoresis assays.
