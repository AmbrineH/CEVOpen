 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> microbial broth was incubated in tubes containing 50 μL of decreasing concentrations of the oil (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 and, 0.63 μL EOs per tube). The MIC was estimated as the lowest EOs concentration that inhibited any visible microbial growth [

To determine the MLC, 0.1 ml of the cell suspensions from the tubes showing no growth were sub-cultured on nutrient agar plates for bacteria and on malt agar plates for yeast to find out if such inhibition was reversible or permanent. The MLC was calculated as the highest EO dilution (lowest concentration) at which no growth occurred on the plates. Three repetitions of each treatment were made.
