<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of the EOs was determined by the agar disc diffusion method as follows: active microbial suspensions were made from 24-h-old agar plates using sterile saline solution up to a concentration of approximately 1–2 x 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The microbial suspension was spread on the surface of Mueller Hinton agar (MHA, Oxoid) plates using a sterile cotton swab in order to have uniform microbial growth. Under aseptic conditions, filter paper discs (diameter 6 mm, Whatman paper No.1, Oxoid) were put on the agar plates (one disc per Petri dish, in order to avoid any possible additional activity), then 10 μL of each EO dilutions (corresponding to 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.63 μL EOs per disc) were put on the discs. The control discs contained 10 μL of methanol. The inoculated plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h to allow microbial growth. Microbial inhibition zones were measured using a digital calliper and given in millimetres (mm). Six repetitions of each treatment were made.
