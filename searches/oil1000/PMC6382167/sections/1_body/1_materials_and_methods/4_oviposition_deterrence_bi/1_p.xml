<p class="p">One hundred and fifty 10- to 14-day-old unsexed adults of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sericata</italic> were put in a 75 cm × 75 cm × 115 cm cage (model BugDorm-2400 model of Insect Rearing Tent) with net on the sides and mesh ends at the front. Oviposition was stimulated by polyethylene embedding moulds filled with lamb meat (5 g) mixed with 1 mL of water to prevent desiccation. The meat was gently flattened down and treated with a glass nebulizer with 100 μL of 0, 2, 5, and 10% ethanol solution of the EO, equal to 0.4, 1, and 2 μL cm
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup>. Four groups each of them composed of four meat-moulds treated with the four different EO concentrations (0, 2, 5, and 10%) were put at each corner of the cage about 10 cm from the edge. A beaker containing 500 mL of water, covered by a net, was put in the cage to increase humidity. The eggs laid onto the meat were counted, 3 and 24 h after the start of the test, under a dissection microscope. Large aggregates of eggs were counted by an analytical balance equipped with a piece-counter feature. The test was performed in three replicates. The cages were placed under a bank of fluorescent lamps to provide even lighting and kept at about 23°C and 75% RH.
