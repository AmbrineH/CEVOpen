<p class="p">The chemical composition of the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> was analysed by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectroscopy (GC-EIMS). The analyses were performed with a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with a HP-5 capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector. Analytical conditions: injector and transfer line temperatures 220°C and 240°C respectively; oven temperature programmed from 60°C to 240°C at 3°C/min; carrier gas helium at 1 mL/min; injection of 0.2 μL (10% hexane solution); split ratio 1:30. Constituents identification was based on comparison of retention times with those of authentic samples, by comparing their LRIs with the series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hydrocarbons and using computer matching against commercial (NIST 2014 and Adams 2007) and home-made library mass spectra (built up from pure substances and components of known oils and mass spectra literature data) [
