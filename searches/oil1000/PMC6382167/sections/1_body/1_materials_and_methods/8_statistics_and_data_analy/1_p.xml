<p class="p">The median lethal dose (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of the EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sericata</italic> adults was calculated by Log-probit regression. Significant differences between the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of the two EOs were determined by estimating the confidence intervals of relative median potency (RMP). The differences were considered statistically significant when values in the 95% confidence interval of relative median potency analyses were â‰  1.0. The percentages of oviposition deterrence, ovicidal activity, and residual AChE activity were arcsine transformed prior to statistical analysis and processed using GLM with one factor (EO) and dose as covariate. 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was used for the significance of differences between means. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of AChE activity (the inhibitory concentration needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity, negative Hill slope) were calculated by nonlinear regression to a four-parameters logistic equation (variable Hill slope). The differences in the sizes of the inhibitory zones formed by the EOs against different microbial strains were tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test and the means were separated by Dunn-Bonferroni pairwise comparisons. Data were processed by SPSS 22.0 software (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, North Castle, New York, USA) and by GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The individual data points behind means and variance measurements for the quantitative analyses presented in the tables are available in
