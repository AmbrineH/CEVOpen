<p class="p">To evaluate the toxicity of the EOs against eggs of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sericata</italic>, fifty freshly laid eggs (0–12 h old) were placed in a Petri dish (5 cm Ø) the lower surface of which was covered with a black filter paper (Hahnemüehle black filter paper, grade 551) treated with 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 5.0%, 10.0%, and 20.0% EtOH solutions of the EOs equal to 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.40, 0.80, and 1.60 μL cm
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup>. As control, 50 eggs were placed on filter paper treated with 100 μL of EtOH only. In all of the treatments, before placing the eggs, the ethanol was evaporated by exposing the treated paper to an airflow for 3–5 min and, then, the paper was wetted with 0.4 mL of water. The tests were performed at room temperature (about 23°C). Egg-hatching was recorded after 48 h. Four replicates per concentration were performed.
