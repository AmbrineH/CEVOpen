An aliquot (300 mg) of adult insects were homogenized in 4 mL of buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mM NaCl. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,000 g at 4Â°C for 15 min and the supernatant containing AChE was filtered through glass wool to remove any excess lipid. The total protein content was quantified by the Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad) and the extracted AChE was used in the AChE assays.
