<p class="p">Inhibition of AChE was determined by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] with few modifications using acetylthiocholine (ACh) as substrate. The protein content of the AChE extract was diluted to 0.1 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and the reaction mixture consisted of 500 μL of diluted AChE extract (which contained 0.05 mg protein mL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and 50 μL of EOs for each concentration (2, 5, 25, 50, 100, 125, and 250 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> dissolved in 5% (v/v) acetone). Controls were prepared by adding acetone at the same concentrations and without EOs. The tube was set in incubator at 25°C for 5 min before adding 100 μL of 0.01 M 5,5’-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; dissolved in phosphate buffer pH 7.0) and 2.4 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The mixture was gently stirred and incubated for another 10 min at 25°C before adding 40 μL of 75 mM ACh (dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 8.0), then the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 25°C. The activity of AChE was measured by spectrophotometry using an Ultrospec 2100 Pro spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Ltd, England) at 25°C by the increase of absorbance at 412 nm. Inhibition percentage of AChE activity was calculated as follows:
