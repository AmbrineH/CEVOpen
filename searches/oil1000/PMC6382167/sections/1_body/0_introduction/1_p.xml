<p class="p">Myiasis, the parasitic infestation of live mammals by fly larvae (maggots), is an extension of the carrion-feeding habits of blowflies [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Gravid females of myiasis-inducing flies such as botfly (Oestridae) and blowfly (Calliphoridae) are attracted and stimulated to lay their eggs on open wounds or even natural body openings of living mammals’ body by a variety of cues, predominantly olfactory ones [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. On hatching of the eggs, the larvae invade the broken skin and feed on the host’s living or dead tissues and body fluids [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Myiasis, is a worldwide severe medical and veterinary problem. In humans, it is a complication of neglected wounds [

 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Particularly in hospitals, the feeding activities of larvae can rapidly lead bedridden patients to develop cutaneous lesions, further oviposition, debilitation, and death. In addition, blowflies can act as carriers of pathogenic bacteria [
