<p class="p">In this trial, EOs extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium nubigenum</italic> (Kunth) Kuntze and 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill (Lamiaceae) were chemically analyzed and tested in laboratory bioassays for toxicity and oviposition deterrence against 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sericata</italic>. In addition, the physiological mechanisms underlying the toxicity of EOs were investigated by enzymatic inhibition tests as well. Given that blowflies are well-known carriers of harmful microorganisms, the antibacterial and antifungal properties of the EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella abaetetuba</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which are common pathogens to mammals, including sheep, were analyzed as well.
