<p class="p">In this study, we tested the EOs extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic>. While 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> is a well-known aromatic plant, the EO of which has been investigated in many trials in the past, only a few reports have been published about the composition of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> [

 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Monoterpenes, particularly the oxygenated ones, seem to be the main components in all the reported essential oil compositions of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> specimens. Ruiz et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] hydrodistilled samples of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> from Ecuador and the EO was mainly rich in oxygenated monoterpenes, the most abundant of which was carvacryl acetate (38.1%). This was followed by carvacrol, accounting for 29.0%. Gilardoni et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] also described the composition of the EO extracted from both dried and fresh plants from Ecuador and the specimens had a pulegone chemotype (37.11 and 72.79% in the dried and fresh samples, respectively). In the dried sample, it was followed by menthone with a relative abundance of 11.57%, whilst, only traces of it could be found in the fresh sample, where the second most abundant compound was linalool (7.81%).
