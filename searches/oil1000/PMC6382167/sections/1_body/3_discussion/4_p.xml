<p class="p">In this trial, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> was found to be more effective than that of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> also in terms of oviposition deterrence. Even though both the EOs did almost completely deter oviposition for up to 3 h after the treatment, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> was the most persistent one maintaining a good oviposition deterrence activity even at the lower dose after 24 hours after the treatment. In keeping with our results, a strong oviposition deterrence was also previously observed for the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dracunculus</italic> against the blowfly 
 <italic class="italic">Calliphora vomitoria</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and for 
 <italic class="italic">Lucilia cuprina</italic>, in media treated with 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. In comparison, the effectiveness of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> (OD% = 72.61 at 2% EO) seems to be in line with those of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">annua</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dracunculus</italic> EOs (OD% = 69.31 and 96.77, respectively, at 2.5% EO). The different effectiveness of the two EOs indicates that the EOS oviposition deterrent effect may depend not only on the different chemical composition of the EOs but also on the target species. Moreover, the complexity of the insectsâ€™ sensory system makes it difficult to understand how the chemical information encoded in the deterrent molecules is perceived by the insect (through olfactory, gustatory or other receptors on the ovipositor or perhaps tarsi) and triggers its behavioural response.
