<p class="p">Extensive evidence suggests that the observed antimicrobial effect of the EOs is due to their interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms. The hydrophobicity of the EOs [
 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] enables their chemical components to accumulate in cell membranes, interfering with their structures and increasing their permeability [

 <xref rid="pone.0212576.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. In fact, such toxic effects (and most likely their toxicity to insects) can be due to a large number of different chemical components of the EOs, the synergistic or antagonistic effects of which do not always let the actual biological effect correlate with the type and quantity of the main components of the EOs [
