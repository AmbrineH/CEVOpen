<p class="p">Flystrike flies usually lay their eggs near wounds or on moist, attractive areas of the sheep. Such preference for wounds and the ability of the larvae to abrade and penetrate in the tissues makes these flies also a source and carrier of microbial infections. EOs can prevent the spread of pathogens through their well-known antimicrobial activity. As expected, we found that

 <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> showed to have clear toxic, bacteriostatic and mycostatic activities against several pathogens. In particular, we found that the Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">abaetetuba</italic> was the overall more resistant pathogen. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the susceptibility of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">abaetetuba</italic> to essential oils of aromatic plant. However, Sahu [

 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">abaetetuba</italic> was susceptible to ethanolic extracts of four 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> species and a clear antimicrobial effect of EOs against

 <italic class="italic">albicans</italic> to essential oils. This is consistent with previous trials that found anti-candida properties in plants used in the Brazilian traditional medicine [
