 <p class="p">Cutaneous myiasis is a severe worldwide medical and veterinary issue. In this trial the essential oil (EO) of the Andean medicinal plant species 
  <italic class="italic">Clinopodium nubigenum</italic> (Kunth) Kuntze was evaluated for its bioactivity against the myiasis-inducing blowfly 
  <italic class="italic">Lucilia sericata</italic> (Meigen) (Diptera Calliphoridae) and compared with that of the well-known medicinal plant species 
  <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill. The EOs were analysed and tested in laboratory for their oviposition deterrence and toxicity against 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">sericata</italic> adults. The physiology of EO toxicity was evaluated by enzymatic inhibition tests. The antibacterial and antifungal properties of the EOs were tested as well. At 0.8 μL cm
  <sup class="sup">-2</sup>, both EOs completely deterred 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">sericata</italic> oviposition up to 3 hours. After 24 h, the oviposition deterrence was still 82.7% for 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> and the 89.5% for 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic>. The two EOs were also toxic to eggs and adults of 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">sericata</italic>. By contact/fumigation, the EOs, the LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values against the eggs were 0.07 and 0.48 μL cm
  <sup class="sup">-2</sup> while, by topical application on the adults, LD
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were 0.278 and 0.393 μL per individual for 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> EOs, respectively. Inhibition of acetylcholine esterase of 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">sericata</italic> by EOs (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 67.450 and 79.495 mg L
  <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic>, respectively) suggested that the neural sites are targets of the EO toxicity. Finally, the observed antibacterial and antifungal properties of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">nubigenum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">angustifolia</italic> EOs suggest that they could also help prevent secondary infections.
