  <p class="p">The PCA plot of the scores produced by the 10 sensor responses to the headspace of carrageenan coated trout fillets plus essential lemon oil (ACTF) along the first two principal components. The number in parentheses indicates the proportion of the total variance explained by each principal component. The abbreviations near the clusters are ACTF0d = carrageenan coated trout fillet day 0 of storage; ACTF3d = carrageenan coated trout fillet day 3 of storage; ACTF6d = carrageenan coated trout fillet 6 days of storage; ACTF9d = carrageenan coated trout fillet 9 days of storage; ACTF12d = carrageenan coated trout fillet 12 days of storage. Results are representative of three trout analyzed for each experimental group.</p>
