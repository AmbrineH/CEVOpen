Analysis was carried out on the control and coated fillets (UTF = uncoated fillets; CTF = coated trout fillets; ACTF = active coated trout fillets; d = day) during the storage time (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days). Î²-actin was used as an internal marker. Results are representative of three trout analyzed for each experimental group. </p>
