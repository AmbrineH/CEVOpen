 <p> The principal components analysis (PCA) plot of the scores produced by the 10 sensor responses to the headspace of uncoated trout fillets (UTF) along the first two principal components. The number in parentheses indicates the proportion of the total variance explained by each principal component. The abbreviations near the clusters are UTF0d = uncoated trout fillet day 0 of storage; UTF3d = uncoated trout fillet day 3 of storage; UTF6d = uncoated trout fillet day 6 of storage; UTF9d = uncoated trout fillet day 9 of storage; UTF12d = uncoated trout fillet 12 days of storage. Results are representative of three trout analyzed for each experimental group. </p>
