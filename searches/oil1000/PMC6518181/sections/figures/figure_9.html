 <p> ATR-FTIR absorption spectra in the region 4000–650 cm −1 of uncoated (UTF), coated (CTF), and coated with ELO (ACTF) trout fillets, after 12 days of storage at 4 °C. The spectrum of trout fillet at 0 day is also shown. Spectra were baseline corrected and normalized for Amide I. Spectra are representative of three trout analyzed. </p>
