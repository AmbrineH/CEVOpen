 <p> ATR-FTIR second derivative of the absorption spectra in the region 1700–1600 cm −1, of uncoated (UTF) ( A), coated (CTF) ( B), and coated with ELO (ACTF) ( C) trout fillets, after 12 days of storage at 4 °C. The comparison of the spectrum of trout fillet at 0d and after 6 days of storage is shown in ( D). 1 = 1628 cm −1 peak; 2 = 1652 cm −1 peak; 3 = 1687 cm −1 peak. Spectra are representative of three samples. d = day. </p>
