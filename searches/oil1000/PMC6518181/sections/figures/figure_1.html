 <p> Hematoxylin–eosin staining of transversal sections of trout fillets. ( A) uncoated trout fillet at the beginning of the experiment (UTF 0 day); ( B) uncoated fillet after a period of 12 days of storage (UTF 12 days); ( C) coated fillet after 12 days of storage (CTF 12 days). ACTF gave similar results to CTF. Scale bars: A, B: 40 μm; C: 20 μm. Sections are representative of three trout analyzed for each experimental group. </p>
