 <p> Diagram of the ratio between amide III peak (1305 cm −1) and the pyrrolidine peak (1451 cm −1) of uncoated (UTF), coated (CTF), and coated with ELO (ACTF) trout fillets, after 12 days of storage at 4 °C. Results are representative of three trout analyzed for each experimental group. Different letters on the columns indicate statistically different values ( p &lt; 0.05); d = day. </p>
