<p class="p">Samples of 1 cm in length were taken from the central area of the fillet and placed in 2-metilbutane extra pure (Acros Organics, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) for 5 s and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. At least three fillets were analyzed for each group. Frozen samples were serially cut on a cryostat (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) in transversal and longitudinal sections of 10 μm. The sections were placed on slides and stained with common hematoxylin–eosin histochemical dyes. Hematoxylin staining (3 min) was followed by rinsing with deionized water and Tap water (to allow stain to develop). Acid ethanol was used to distain. Then, eosin staining (30 s) was carried out and was followed by rinsing with ethanol and Xylene. Coverslip slides were put in position by using Permount and allowed to dry. Slides were observed at an optic microscope (Leica DMRA2, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and images were acquired and photographed using a DC300F digital camera.</p>
