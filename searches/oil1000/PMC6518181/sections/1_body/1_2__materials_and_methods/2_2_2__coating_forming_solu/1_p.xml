<p class="p">Food-grade carrageenan (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St Louis, MO, USA) was used in the coating formulations. Preliminary tests carried out in this laboratory with 0.5, 1, and 2% of carrageenan were carried out for the optimal coating formulation. One percent carrageenan gave the best results in terms of gel strengthand was therefore used for the successive coating formulation. The gel strength was evaluated with the Rowerbal method [

 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], 1% of essential lemon oil (ELO) was used in the carrageenan coating formulation. ELO was kindly provided by SSEA—Experimental Station of Essential Oil and Citrus Products—Reggio Calabria (Italy). ELO characterization has been reported in Socaciu et al. [

Carrageenan solution was prepared by mixing 1 g of carrageenan with 100 mL of distilled water and stirred at a temperature of 100 °C until the mixture became clear. Before gelation (at ~30 °C) 1% of ELO was mixed with the prepared carrageenan solution and stirred thoroughly. Trout fillets were divided into three groups and underwent to the following treatment. Group 1: uncoated trout fillets (UTF). Group 2: trout fillets coated with 1% carrageenan (coated trout fillets—CTF). Group 3: trout fillets coated with 1% carrageenan containing 1% ELO (active coated trout fillets—ACTF). Fillets were then stored in a refrigerator at 0–4 °C. During the 12-day storage, samples were randomly taken every 3 days for analyses.
