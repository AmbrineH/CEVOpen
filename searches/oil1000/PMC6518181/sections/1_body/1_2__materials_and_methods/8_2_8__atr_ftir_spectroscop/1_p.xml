<p class="p">Trout fillets were frozen, lyophilized, minced, and placed directly on the germanium piece of the infrared spectrometer with constant pressure applied. In the case of coated trout fillets, the coating was removed before the lyophilization. The pressure of the ATR-FTIR acquisition was 80 ± 2 psi. The FTIR spectra were recorded in the mid-IR region (4000–650 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) at resolutions of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with 32 scans using Perkin Elmer FTIR Frontier coupled with DTGS (deuterated tri-glycine sulphate) detector (Perkin-Elmer Inc., Norwalk, CT, USA). Air background spectrum was recorded before each sample. Three samples for each group were analyzed and each sample was analyzed in triplicate. The spectra were baseline corrected and normalized on amide I.
