<p class="p">TBARS was evaluated according to Thiansilakul et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The ground sample (0.5 g) was homogenized with 2.5 mL of solution containing 0.375% thiobarbituric acid (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), 15% trichloroacetic acid (
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic>), and 0.25 M HCl. The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath (95–100 °C) for 10 min until it turned into a pink color, cooled with running tap water and centrifuged at 3600 g at 25 °C for 20 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm. A standard curve was prepared using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane at concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 ppm. Absorbance of TBARS was measured at 532nm and TBARS were calculated and expressed as mg malonaldehyde/kg sample.
