<p class="p">Proteins from trout fillets were extracted with Lysis buffer (220 mM D-Mannitol, 70 mM Saccharose, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mMTris, pH 7.4, containing protein inhibitors 2 mM PMSF, 1 mM pepstatin A, 2 mM trypsin inhibitor from chicken egg white). Fillets were homogenized with ultra-turraxT25 (IKA-labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) for three times at 500 rpm, 800 rpm, and 14,000 rpm for 10 min/each. The supernatants were collected and underwent protein determination with the Bio-Rad dye protein assay (Bio-Rad laboratories Inc., Perth, UK). Samples were boiled at 98 °C for 10 min in loading buffer (50 mM trisHCl pH 6.8, 100 mM β-mercaptaethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% blue bromophenol, 10% glycerol). The proteins were separated on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 4% stacking gel in 1% Tris-glycine buffer (0.025 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) in a miniprotean cell (Bio-Rad) at 130 volts for 2 h. The separated proteins were electro transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with transfer buffer (39 mMTris base, 0.2 M glycine, and 20% methanol, pH 8.5), in a minitransfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 100 volts at 4 °C for 2 h. Membranes were incubated at 4°C for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 1% PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% dried, nonfat milk with antibodies raised against domain III/IV of titin (N-terminal/Z-domain) (MABT75; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and polyclonal antibodies against β-actin (A5060, Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St Louis, MO, USA) as internal marker, overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:500. The incubation with the secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) was carried out for 1h at RT. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence with the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with Chemidoc (Bio-Rad). A prestained molecular weight ladder (Novex Sharp protein standard, LC5800, Invitrogen, Hilden, Germany) was used to determine the protein size. Western blotting bands were quantified by Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software version 4.6.1. </p>
