<p class="p">Values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) calculated using MS Excel. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to estimate significant differences (

To isolate the group or groups that differ from the others Multiple Comparisons versus Control Group (Holm–Sidak method) was used. For Electronic Nose, six independent measures were performed for each sample, with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3. Correlation Matrix (CM) of data was performed by using the Win Muster software. CM shows the quantitative assessment of classes severability. Values of discrimination index (DI) were in the range of 0 and 1. Values lower than 0.5 show poor severability of classes, while higher values indicate worthy severability of classes (Volpe et al. 2014) [
