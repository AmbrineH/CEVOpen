<p class="p">Peroxide value (PV), expressed as meq of free iodine per kg of lipids, was performed according to the method Cd 8–53 (AOCS, 1998) of the American Oil Chemists’ Society (AOCS). Briefly, 1.0 g of lipid sample was treated with 25 mL of solvent mixture (chloroform/acetic acid 2/3). After shaking the mixture, 1 mL of saturated potassium iodide solution was added. The mixture was kept in the dark for 5 min, thereafter 75 mL of distilled water was added under stirring. Starch solution (0.5 mL, 1%
