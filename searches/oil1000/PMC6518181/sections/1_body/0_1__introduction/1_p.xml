<p class="p">Fish is among the most perishable food commodities whose quality declines as a result of a complex mix of biochemical, chemical, physical, and microbiological phenomena. It is estimated that ~10% of the fishery and aquaculture products is lost due to degradation (FAO report, 2018). Of primary concern is the development of off-flavors and odors caused by the production of ammonia, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, and other volatile amines, whose high levels lead to undesirable organoleptic characteristics [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Other volatile molecules which are mainly produced during the spoilage process are hydrogen (H2) “odorless”, methane (CH4) “odorless”, ammonia (NH3) “quaint pungent”, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) “rotten eggs”, and phosphane (PH3) “rotten fish”. The Electronic Nose has been efficiently used to detect the molecules arising during decomposition of fish flesh, even when odorless [

 <xref rid="B3-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Not less critical is the oxidation of fat, one of the most important mechanisms leading to food spoilage, causing changes in taste and odor and deterioration of muscle texture [
