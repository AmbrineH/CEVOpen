<p class="p">In a previous paper by the same authors, the effectiveness of an edible active carrageenan coating and carrageenan coating incorporating essential lemon oil in slowing down the microbial growth and preserving the fatty acid profile of fresh trout fillets stored at 4 °C, has been described [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In this study, we extend our investigation using a combination of methods to assess the effectiveness of edible carrageenan coatings with or without the addition of essential lemon oil to delay the decay of muscle structure, lipid peroxidation, and olfactory characteristics of rainbow trout (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) fillets stored at 4 °C up to 12 days. All the methods used are in agreement and indicate the coating formed by carrageenan added with ELO, as the best method to lengthen the shelf-life of trout fillets. Moreover, the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is confirmed as a useful tool to assess the trout fillet modifications in a rapid and cost-effective fashion.
