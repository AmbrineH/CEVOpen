<p class="p">The employment of carrageenan coating and carrageenan coating enriched with ELO extended the shelf life of trout fillets stored at 4 °C. In particular, trout fillets coated with the carrageenan coating enriched with essential lemon oil are preserved better than uncoated and coated with carrageenan alone fillets. Uncoated fillets showed a more disaggregated muscle structure due to the increase of the inter muscle fiber space. The peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances increased in coated samples more slowly than in uncoated samples during the storage period. The electronic nose analysis showed that trout fillets coated with the carrageenan coating maintained the olfactory characteristics better than the uncoated ones. All together, carrageenan coating enriched with ELO was the best to preserve the morphological, physical–chemical, and olfactory characteristics of the fresh trout fillet. The obtained results can be a major interest topic about processing and storage of a high perishable food such as fresh fish. </p>
