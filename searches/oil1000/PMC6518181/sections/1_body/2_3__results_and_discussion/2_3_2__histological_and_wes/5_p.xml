<p class="p">We observed neither variations of titin expression nor degradation during the storage period, both in the control and coated fillets (CTF and ACTF). Our results are in agreement with a previous study by Hernandez-Herrero et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Gadus morhua</italic>) during ice storage only when the fish was in advanced decomposition. The evidence that trout fillets coated with carrageenan and carrageenan plus ELO were well preserved suggests that the presence of the coating with or without the ELO delays the degenerative processes. Such outcome may be related to the oxygen barrier properties of edible films and coatings. Carbohydrates, such as carrageenan, are indeed excellent barriers to oxygen, because of their tightly packed, ordered hydrogen bonded network structure. Moreover, the addition of antioxidants, such as vitamins and essential oils, can entail further protection due to the enhancement of the oxygen barrier properties of the film and coating [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Meyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] found that carrageenan coatings extended the shelf life of poultry pieces by acting as an oxygen barrier. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the coating used in this study protected the muscle from the oxidative processes that induce the production of free radicals, which are in turn responsible for muscle and intramuscular tissue susceptibility to proteases, with consequent postmortem tenderization of fish muscle [
