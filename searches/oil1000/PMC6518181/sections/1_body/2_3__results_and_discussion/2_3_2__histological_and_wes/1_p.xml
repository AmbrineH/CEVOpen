 <xref rid="B37-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. It has been proposed that in fish the post mortem modifications on the muscle structure and consistency are mainly due to the degradation process of the tissues between myomers rather than the muscle tissue. Ando and coworkers [

 <xref rid="B38-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] demonstrated by light and electron microscopy that postmortem tenderization of rainbow trout muscle is mainly due to the disintegration of collagen fibers and the extracellular matrix in the connective tissues. In this study, both transversal and longitudinal sections of rainbow trout fillets were carried out in order to evaluate the muscle morphology. Three samples, belonging to different trout, for each treatment (UTC, CTF, and ACTF) were analyzed up to 12 days of storage at 4 Â°C. Transversal sections showed a compact structure with the muscle fibers firmly associated with the connective tissue at the beginning of the experiment (

The progression of the storage period accompanied to the modification of the fillet structure with a consequent muscle fiber disorganization both in the control and coated (CTF and ACTF) samples. In particular, the muscle fibers gradually detached from the myocommata and the distance between myofibers increased, providing the tissue with a loose aspect. However, looseness was more pronounced in the control (
