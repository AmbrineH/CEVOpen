<p class="p">The smell is an important sensorial attribute of a food, not only because it is a sign of pleasantness, but also because odor, usually unpleasant, is due to microbial and biochemical alterations during food storage [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. It is therefore important to define the olfactory characteristics of a food, as an indication of microbial and biochemical deterioration. The electronic nose is a quick and reliable method for measuring the olfactory footprint of a food. The electronic nose is made up of electronic sensors capable of detecting volatile chemicals and is able to translate these substances into a recognizable and classifiable models capable of discriminating different types of samples [

 <xref rid="B49-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] highlighted the correlation between the olfactory footprint and bacteriological composition during the deterioration of cold-smoked Atlantic salmon. In this study, we have detected the olfactory foodprint of trout fillets stored at 4 Â°C up to 12 days, without and with carrageenan coating, and carrageenan coating plus ELO.
