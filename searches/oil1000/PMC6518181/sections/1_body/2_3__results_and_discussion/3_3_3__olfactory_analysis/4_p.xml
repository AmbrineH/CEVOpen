<p class="p">The DIs of the samples UTF 6d, UTF 9d, and UTF 12d correlated to UTF 0d are significant; whereas the CMs of CTF and ACTF treated samples did not show any significant value. It is possible to argue that CTF and ACTF preserved samples retained olfactory characteristics better than UTF samples during the evaluation period. The values of DIs of ACTF 3d, ACTF 6d, and ACTF 12d correlated to ACTF 0d were lower than CTF 3d; CTF 6d and CTF 12d correlated to CTF 0d.</p>
