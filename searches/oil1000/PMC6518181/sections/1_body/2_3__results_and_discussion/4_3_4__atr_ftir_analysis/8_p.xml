<p class="p">The storage period of the trout fillets at 4 °C in the absence of coating shows the decrease in the intensity of the peak at 1628 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The peak at 1652 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> shows an increase in intensity at 6 and 9 days, and a decrease at 3 days of storage. The 1687 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> peak shows limited variations in intensity, while a shift from 1687 to 1685 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was detected. In the presence of carrageenan, there were variations in both intensity and wavelength of the peaks at 1628 and 1652 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In the trout fillets coated with carrageenan and ELO, the peaks at 1628 and 1652 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> appeared, at all days of storage, very similar to trout fillets at 0 day, with the exception of the trout fillets at 12 days of storage, when both peaks appeared less intense in comparison to trout fillets at 0 day. The peak at 1687 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of the trout fillets at 9 and 12 days of storage showed a shift with respect to the fillets at 0 day and 3 and 6 days of storage. The comparison of the trout fillet spectra at 0 day and after 6 days of storage at 4 °C showed how in the presence of coating and coating plus ELO, the profiles were superposable to 0 day, while the profile of the untreated trout fillets clearly differed in the peak at 1628 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> showing a decrease in intensity, in the peak at 1652 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> showing an increase in intensity and in the peak at 1687 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> showing a shift at 1685 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Variations in intensity and shift of the peaks related to the secondary structure of fish tissue proteins have been reported during the surimi gelation [
 <xref rid="B66-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy showed a significant decrease in the α-helix /β-sheet ratio in surimi after 2 years of storage at −20 °C [
 <xref rid="B67-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Recently, the rearrangement of protein hydrogen bonding has been reported during surimi gelation, involving a partial change of α-helix of myosin into β-sheet, β-turn, and random coil [
 <xref rid="B68-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. In this study, the decrease in the 1628 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> peak intensity during the prolonged storage at 4 °C, in both uncoated and coated trout fillets, may indicate modifications in the β-sheet structure, also confirmed by the shift of the 1687 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> peak. The 1652 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> peak seems to be more stable, indicating a substantial maintaining of the α-helix structure.
