<p class="p">To analyze lipid content and structure, particular attention was given to the spectral region of 2800–3100 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and, in particular, to the variation of the peak absorbance at 3011, 1743, 1451, and 1305 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The peak at 3011 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is usually considered a marker of peroxidative processes [

 <xref rid="B58-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], and therefore its increase is indicative of a higher amount of peroxidized fatty acyl chains. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00113-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref> are reported representative spectra of the peak absorbance in UTF up to 12 days. Spectra are normalized for amide I. It can be seen that the 3011 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> peak is slightly visible at 0 day, while it becomes more pronounced with the progression of the storage time. Similarly, the peak at 1743 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, associated with peroxidation of fatty acid chains [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], increased over time of storage.
