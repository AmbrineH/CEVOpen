<p class="p">FTIR spectroscopy is a tool used to study the secondary structure of proteins [
 <xref rid="B62-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. In fact, the derived analysis of the amide region I, between 1600 and 1700 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, provides information about the α and β structure of proteins [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. In particular, vibrational components in the area of 1620–1640 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are indicative of a β-sheet structure. The antiparallel β-sheet structure can also be identified by the presence of vibrational components in the area of 1670–1695 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, while α-helical conformation gives rise to infrared absorption in the range of 1650 to 1658 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B64-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. However, it is necessary to obtain a good discrimination of the peaks in the area of the amide I through the calculation of the second derivative that amplifies the vibrational component separation [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. The alterations in the frequency and intensity of the vibrational components or peaks are able to provide valuable information on the secondary structure and may reveal conformational changes deriving from the interaction of the protein with other molecules and with the surrounding chemical environment (pH, temperature, solvents, detergents, etc.) [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. In this study, the second derivative of trout fillets at 0d highlights three peaks in the amide I region at the wavelengths of 1628, 1652, and 1687 cm
