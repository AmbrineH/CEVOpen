 <xref rid="B56-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], the integrity of the collagen triple helix can be monitored by analyzing the ratio of the absorbance of the amide III and the peak corresponding to the stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine rings. The amide III band is indeed related to CN stretching and NH, and is involved with the triple helical structure of collagen [
 <xref rid="B61-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The integrity of the collagen secondary structure may be verified when the value of the ratio is greater than or equal to the unit. Changes in this absorption ratio indicate significant structural alterations in the collagen triple helix. In this study, the value of the ratio between amide III peak (1305 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and the pyrrolidine rings peak (1451 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) found at 0d was 1.00. The ratio decreased in UTF over time reaching a value of 0.65 after 12 days of storage. In the CTF and ACTF trout fillets the decrease in the ratio was less pronounced, reaching values of 0.76 and 0.85, respectively, after 12 days (
