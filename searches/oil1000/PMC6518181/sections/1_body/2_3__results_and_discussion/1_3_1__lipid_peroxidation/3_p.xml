<p class="p">Trout muscle tissue is rich in lipids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Among lipids, both free fatty acids and triglycerides are subject to oxidation, although the former are oxidized more readily. Considering that the lipid content of fresh trout is ~2.121 Â± 0.06 g, the content of peroxide is equal to 0.8 meq/kg of lipids at time zero, while the sample peroxide values were respectively 8.6 meq for UTF, 5.3 for CTF and 4.0 for ACTF after 12 days of preservation. Peroxide values in the uncoated trout fillets ranged from 0.8 to 8.6 meq/Kg of lipids with a maximum at 9 days equal to 9.32 meq/kg.
