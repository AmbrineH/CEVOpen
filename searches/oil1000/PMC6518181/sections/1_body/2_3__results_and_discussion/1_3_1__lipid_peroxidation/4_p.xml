<p class="p">Peroxide values in CTF fillets ranged from 0.8 to 5.3 meq/Kg of lipids, while in ACTF fillets ranged from 0.8 to 4.2 meq/Kg of lipids. Peroxide values were significantly lower in CTF and ACTF than in UTF. This outcome shows that the active coating slows down the development of lipid peroxidation in trout fillets stored at 4 °C. These results are in agreement with previous studies [
