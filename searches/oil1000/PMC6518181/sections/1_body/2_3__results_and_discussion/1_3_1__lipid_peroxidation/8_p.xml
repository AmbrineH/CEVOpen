<p class="p">A substantial increase in TBARS was observed in UTF samples with respect to CTF and ACTF trout fillets. The higher efficacy of ACTF with respect to CTF, in slowing down the production of TBARS was probably due to the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of ELO [

 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] reported that the incorporation of ELO into gelatin film could strengthen the antimicrobial and antioxidative characteristics of the film, resulting in an increase of the qualities and the shelf-life of the sea bass refrigerated fillets. It has also been reported that ELO is effective as a free radical scavenger and metal chelating agent. The antioxidant properties of essential oils have been ascribed to different mechanisms: impediment of radical chain initiation, binding of transition metal ion catalysts, decomposition of peroxides, and interaction with the free radicals [
