<p class="p">Rats’ hind paws were challenged with 0.1 mL carrageenan (1% in 0.9%, sub-planter). They showed an inflammatory reaction, as recorded by an increase in paw thickness measured hourly for 5 h and then at 24 h post injection. The increase peaked at 4 h post injection to reach 4.1 ± 0.26 mm over baseline readings (paw thickness measured before carrageenan injection). On the other hand, rats pretreated 1 h earlier with the extract (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently attenuated the increase in edema thickness values, represented as a decrease in the area under the time curve (AUC
 <sub class="sub">0-24</sub>), by 33 and 55% of control values, respectively (

Additionally, the latter response was more pronounced than that achieved in rats treated with the standard anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac (20 mg/kg, p.o.), which showed only a 40% reduced edema thickness compared to control rats.
