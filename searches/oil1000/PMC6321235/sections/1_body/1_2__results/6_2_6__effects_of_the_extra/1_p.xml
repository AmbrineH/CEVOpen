This increase was almost 7-fold as compared to saline injected controls. This effect was attenuated by pre-treating the mice with the extract (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) 1 h prior to acetic acid injection by 74 and 78%, respectively. Additionally, the reference standard, diclofenac, achieved a 60% lower reading compared to control mice (
