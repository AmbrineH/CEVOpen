<p class="p">Initially, we investigated the ability of the extract to inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro, to find out whether the extract would exhibit anti-inflammatory activities or not. Interestingly, the extract exhibited promising activities, and the inhibition of COX-1 by the extract was comparable to that of diclofenac. The extract inhibited COX-2 with half the potency of celecoxib. Moreover, the extract inhibited LOX in vitro with nearly double the potency of zileuton, the reference LOX inhibitor (
