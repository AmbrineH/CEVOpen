<p class="p">Several phenolic acids were reported in the extract. Among them, three new compounds were tentatively annotated based on their retention times, molecular weights, and MS/MS fragmentation. For instance, compound 22 exhibited a molecular ion peak at [M − H]
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 397, and main fragment ions at 193, 175 and 160. The latter fragments are characteristic of ferulic acid, thus, the compound was assigned to ferulic acid acyl-glucoside (

 <sup class="sup">−</sup>
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> at 411, and main fragment ions at 193, 175, and 160. The difference between compound 22 and 30 was 14 amu (methyl group), thus, the latter was assigned to ferulic acid propionyl-glucoside (
