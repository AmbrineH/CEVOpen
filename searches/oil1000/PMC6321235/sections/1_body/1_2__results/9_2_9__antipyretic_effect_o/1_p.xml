 <xref rid="molecules-23-03238-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, mice injected with 30% Brewer’s yeast suspension (1 mL/100 g, s.c.) showed an increased rectal body temperature (38.36 ± 0.1) when measured 18 h post injection. Mice treated with the extract (200 mg/kg, p.o.) did not show any significant changes in rectal temperature over the whole period of experiment, which lasted 24 h. However, increasing the dose of the extract to 400 mg/kg showed fast and significant reduction in rectal temperatures compared to vehicle treated mice, starting 30 min post treatment (
