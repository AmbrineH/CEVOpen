<p class="p">In this work, the phytochemical profile of a methanol extract from 
 <italic class="italic">A. zerumbet</italic> leaves was comprehensively characterized using HPL-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 37 secondary metabolites were characterized. In addition to common phenolic acids such as cinnamic acid, isoferulic acid, eucomic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, and sinapic acid, four new ferulic acid derivatives were tentatively annotated. Additionally, several flavonoids, among them apigenin, pinocembrin, kaempferol-3-
