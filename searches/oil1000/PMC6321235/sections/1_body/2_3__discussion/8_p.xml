 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03238" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Brewerâ€™s yeast-induced pyrexia is caused by increasing the synthesis of prostaglandins, and therefore is used as a common model for the screening of active antipyretic drugs from natural and synthetic origins [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-03238" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The present study showed that the high dose level of the extract significantly attenuated rectal temperature of yeast-induced febrile mice, and its effect was even more potent than acetaminophen (150 mg/kg), the well-known antipyretic drug. The effect of the extract may be attributed to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus. This was also confirmed by the ability of the extract to inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 in our in vitro study.
