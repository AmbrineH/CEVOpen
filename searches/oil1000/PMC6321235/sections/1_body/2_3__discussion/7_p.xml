<p class="p">During the acute cellular phase of inflammation, infiltration of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, from the blood into the tissue occurs. These neutrophils release oxygen-derived free radicals, among them hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions (O

Another suggested mechanism by which the extract could inhibit the inflammatory response to carrageenan is the inhibition of the cellular phase by reducing the recruitment of neutrophil to the inflammation site. This idea was supported by the ability of the extract to decrease the number of leucocytes in the peritoneum of mice challenged with carrageenan. The previous effect may be attributed to the free radical scavenging power of the extract and the potent antioxidant activity of polyphenols [
