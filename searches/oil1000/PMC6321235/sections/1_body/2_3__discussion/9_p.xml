<p class="p">The present study also investigated the anti-nociceptive activity of the extract by two methods. These methods included chemical nociception in the test model of acetic acid-induced writhing, and thermal nociception in the hot plate test. The hot plate test is a typical model to evaluate narcotic analgesia or central anti-nociceptive effects. The anti-nociceptive potential of the extract was shown by hot plate test (significant only 3 h post treatment), while nalbuphine, the narcotic anti-nociceptive standard, had a significant effect at all time points. It is assumed that the extract has a peripheral anti-nociceptive effect, but a less potent central anti-nociceptive effect than nalbuphine.</p>
