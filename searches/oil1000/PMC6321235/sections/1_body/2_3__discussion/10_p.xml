<p class="p">The writhing test is often used to evaluate the peripheral anti-nociceptive activity of drugs. Acetic acid causes secretion of endogenous pain mediators, thus stimulating the neurons responsible for pain sensation [

In this study, the low dose level of the extract demonstrated solid anti-nociceptive effects in the acetic acid-induced writhing test in mice. This result suggests that the extract has peripheral anti-nociceptive properties and they might be attributed by blocking the release of endogenous inflammatory mediators such as leukotriene, prostaglandin, serotonin, and histamine. This assumption was supported by the ability of the extract to inhibit both COX and LOX in the in vitro study. The biological activity data suggest that the anti-inflammatory and different anti-nociceptive effects of the
