<p class="p">Carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema occurs in two phases, an early vascular phase and a late cellular phase, in which different mediators operate sequentially to produce the inflammatory response. Histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin represent the first detectable mediators in the early phase of carrageenan-induced inflammation, while the release of prostaglandins (PGs) is characteristic of the late phase of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-03238" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In the present study, the extract was capable of inhibiting COX-1 and thus the production of PGs. These results would explain the ability of the extract to subside carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema. It was reported recently that the second accelerating phase of edema was not only attributed to the increased production of PGs, but also correlated to the induction of COX-2 in the hind paw. Therefore, we studied the effect of the extract on COX-2. The extract has a potent inhibitory effect on COX-2, and its effect was comparable to celecoxib, a well-known COX-2 inhibitor.
