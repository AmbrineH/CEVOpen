<p class="p">Furthermore, the extract was more potent on acetic acid induced vascular permeability in mice than diclofenac. In this model, acetic acid causes an increase in the level of histamine in peritoneal fluids, serotonin, and prostaglandins, which leads to vasodilation of blood vessels and an increase in vascular permeability in the peritoneal cavity [
