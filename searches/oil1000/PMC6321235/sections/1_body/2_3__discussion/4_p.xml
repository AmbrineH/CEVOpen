<p class="p">We also tried to confirm the anti-inflammatory properties of the leaf extract, and to investigate its mechanism of action. Therefore, we used another model of inflammation, the carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration into peritoneal cavity in mice. The extract exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect against carrageenan induced leukocyte migration into the peritoneal cavity in mice. The highest used dose (400 mg/kg, p.o.) exerted a similar effect to that of diclofenac. </p>
