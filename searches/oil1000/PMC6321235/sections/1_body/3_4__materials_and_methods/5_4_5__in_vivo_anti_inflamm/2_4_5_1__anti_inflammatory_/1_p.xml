 <italic class="italic">A. zerumbet</italic> extract (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.), or diclofenac (20 mg/kg, p.o) were given to the rats 1 h before carrageenan challenge. Next, carrageenan solution (1% in 0.9% NaCl, 0.1 mL) was injected into the sub plantar tissue of the rat hind paw. The paw thickness (mm) was measured before and after the carrageenan injection, at hourly intervals for 5 h and then at 24 h, using a caliper ruler. The area under the changes in paw thicknessâ€“time curve for the whole observation period of 24 h was calculated to demonstrate the cumulative anti-inflammatory effect of the extract.
