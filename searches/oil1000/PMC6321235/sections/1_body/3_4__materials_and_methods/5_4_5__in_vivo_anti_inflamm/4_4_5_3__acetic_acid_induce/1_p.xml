<p class="p">The acetic acid-induced vascular permeability test was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-03238" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Briefly, mice were treated with the extract (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.), diclofenac (20 mg/kg), or vehicle. 1 h later, the tail vein was injected with 0.2 mL Evans blue (0.25% solution in normal saline). After 30 min, acetic acid (0.6% in normal saline, 1 mL/100 g) was injected in the peritoneal cavity of the mice. Another group of mice was injected with normal saline only, and served as a control. After another 30 min, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The abdominal cavities were washed with 3 mL saline, and the washings were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The vascular permeability is proportional to Evans blue dye content of the supernatant that was detected at 610 nm using a plate reader (BioTeK, Vt, USA).
