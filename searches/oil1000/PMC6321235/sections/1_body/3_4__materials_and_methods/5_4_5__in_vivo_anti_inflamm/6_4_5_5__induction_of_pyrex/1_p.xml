<p class="p">Pyrexia was induced in mice as described previously, with modifications [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03238" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Briefly, initial body temperature of the rectum was recorded for each mouse using a lubricated digital thermometer. Next, Brewer’s yeast suspension was prepared in normal saline (30%), and then the yeast suspension (1 mL/100 g) was injected subcutaneously behind the neck. 18 h later, the rectal temperature was recorded again (T
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>), and mice that showed a temperature higher than T
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> by at least 0.5 °C were included in the study. Pyretic animals were then treated with the extract, paracetamol (150 mg/kg) or vehicle. The rectal temperature was recorded again at 30 min, 1, 2, 3 and 24 h posttreatment.
