<p class="p">The ability of the extract to inhibit leukocyte recruitment to the peritoneal cavity after carrageenan injection was investigated as described previously [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-03238" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Briefly, Swiss albino mice (average weight 25–30 g, n = 5–6/group), were treated with the vehicle (1 mL/100 g, p.o.) as a control group, or the extract in two different doses (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.), or the standard compound diclofenac (20 mg/kg, p.o.). 30 min later, 0.1 mL carrageenan solution (500 μg/mice) or 0.1 mL sterile saline was injected intraperitoneally. The animals were euthanized after 3  h, and the peritoneal cavity was rinsed using 3 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mM (EDTA). The total leukocyte count was determined in the peritoneal cavity wash using a hemocytometer, and expressed as number of cells/mL.
