<p class="p">Swiss albino mice weighing 25–30 g (n = 5–6/group) received the extract (200 mg/kg, p.o.), the vehicle (10 mL/kg, p.o.), or the reference compound nalbuphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). After 1 h, the mice response to heat-induced nociceptive pain was assessed individually by placing on a hot plate heated at 55 ± 1 °C. The latency until mice showed first signs of discomfort (licking of the fore and hind paws, hind paw lifting, or jumping) was recorded, before (baseline) and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h following different treatments.</p>
