 <p> Effect of treatment with two dose levels (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) of A. zerumbet or the reference standard, diclofenac (20 mg/kg, p.o.), on carrageenan-induced (1% suspension, 0.1 mL/rat) hind paw edema in rats. Edema thickness (mm) was measured before and every hour for 5 h, and at 24 h after carrageenan injection. Results represent the AUC 0-24 after 24 h and are expressed as mean Â± S.E.M. (n = 5). * p &lt; 0.001 vs. control values. </p>
