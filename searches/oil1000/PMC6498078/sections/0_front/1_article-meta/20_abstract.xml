  <p class="p">The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of essential oil mixture (EOM) supplementation on rumen fermentation characteristics and microbial changes in an

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p class="p">Three experimental treatments were used: control (CON, no additive), EOM 0.1 (supplementation of 1 g EOM/kg of substrate), and EOM 0.2 (supplementation of 2 g EOM/kg of substrate). An 
   <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> fermentation experiment was carried out using strained rumen fluid for 12 and 24 h incubation periods. At each time point, 
   <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), neutral detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD), pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N), and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, and relative microbial diversity were estimated.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p class="p">After 24 h incubation, treatments involving EOM supplementation led to significantly higher IVDMD (treatments and quadratic effect; p = 0.019 and 0.008) and IVNDFD (linear effect; p = 0.068) than did the CON treatment. The EOM 0.2 supplementation group had the highest NH
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N concentration (treatments; p = 0.032). Both EOM supplementations did not affect total VFA concentration and the proportion of individual VFAs; however, total VFA tended to increase in EOM supplementation groups, after 12 h incubation (linear; p = 0.071). Relative protozoa abundance significantly increased following EOM supplementation (treatments, p&lt;0.001). 
   <italic class="italic">Selenomonas ruminantium</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Ruminococcus albus</italic> (treatments; p&lt;0.001 and p = 0.005), abundance was higher in the EOM 0.1 treatment group than in CON. The abundance of 
   <italic class="italic">Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens</italic>, fungi and 
   <italic class="italic">Ruminococcus flavefaciens</italic> (treatments; p&lt; 0.001, p&lt;0.001, and p = 0.005) was higher following EOM 0.2 treatment.

  <title class="title">Conclusion</title>
  <p class="p">The addition of newly developed EOM increased IVDMD, IVNDFD, and tended to increase total VFA indicating that it may be used as a feed additive to improve rumen fermentation by modulating rumen microbial communities. Further studies would be required to investigate the detailed metabolic mechanism underlying the effects of EOM supplementation.</p>
