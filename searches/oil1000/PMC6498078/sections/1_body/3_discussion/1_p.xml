<p class="p">The EO supplementation in ruminant diets can change rumen microbial activity and fermentation characteristics because of their antimicrobial activity. Dorman and Deans [
 <xref rid="b3-ajas-18-0652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] also reported that the inconsistent rumen fermentation results following the dietary addition of EO might be attributed to the type and structural configuration of EO when different kinds of EO are administrated together. Therefore, numerous researchers have been developing new EOM candidates for useful modulation of rumen environment. In this study, newly developed EOM containing eugenol, thymol, and cinnamaldehyde was evaluated for efficacy to improve rumen fermentation pattern by
