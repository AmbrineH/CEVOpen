<p class="p">Regardless with increased digestibility, total VFA and those proportions after 24 h incubation were not changed by EOM supplementation. We expected that total VFA concentration would increase because the increase in nutrient digestibility and changes of central ruminal bacterial abundance were observed at 24 h incubation. Several studies reported that total VFA concentrations or their proportion were not affected by the supplementation of EO [

We postulated that the increase in protozoal abundance by EO addition might be linked with the increase in fiber digestibility without changes of VFA production because they engulf feed particles and ruminal bacteria thereby the bacterial fermentation contribution to VFA production would be impaired [
