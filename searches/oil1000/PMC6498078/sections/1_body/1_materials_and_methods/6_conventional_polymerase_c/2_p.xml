<p class="p">Real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed on a CFX 96 Touch system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, lnc. USA). Reactions were performed in triplicate with reaction volumes of 20 μL using optical reaction plates sealed with optical adhesive film. Each reaction mixture contained 0.5 μL 10 mM dNTP Mix (BioFACT, Daejeon, Korea), 2 μL 10× buffer (BioFACT, Korea), 1 μL 40 ng genomic DNA, 1 μL forward primer (10 pmol), 1 μL reverse primer (10 pmol), 0.1 μL Taq polymerase (BioFACT, Korea), 1 μL Evagreen (SolGent Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea) and 13.4 μL PCR grade water. Real-time PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as follows: initialization for one cycle at 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles each for denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 30 s; and final elongation at 72°C for 5 min. Fluorescence was recorded at the end of each denaturation and extension step, and specificity of amplicon was confirmed via dissociation curve analysis of PCR end products by increasing the temperature at a rate of 1°C after every 30 s, from 60°C to 95°C. The threshold cycle (
