 <xref rid="b16-ajas-18-0652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="b17-ajas-18-0652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and presented in 
 <xref rid="t1-ajas-18-0652" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to validate the specificity of the primer in 50 μL reaction volumes using AccuPower PCR PreMix K-2013 (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea), by adding 2 μL each of forward and reverse primers, 2 μL of genomic DNA and 44 μL of PCR grade water. Reactions were performed using a C1000 Thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) under the following conditions: initialization for one cycle at 95°C for 10 min; 35 cycles each for denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 30 s; and final elongation at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 1.5% agarose gel impregnated with Staining STAR (DYNEBIO INC, Seongnam, Korea), to confirm a single specific band and the absence of primer dimer products.
