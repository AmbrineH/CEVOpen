<p class="p">A complete randomized block design was used for the experiment, with treatment as the main effect. Three experimental treatments were used, i.e., control (CON, no additive), EOM 0.1 (1 g EOM/kg of experimental substrate), EOM 0.2 (2 g EOM/kg of experimental substrate). The amount of EOM added was determined based on the manufacturerâ€™s recommendation.</p>
