The experimental substrates were dried at 60°C for 96 h, and ground in a cyclone mill (Foss Tecator Cyclotec 1093, Foss, Hillerød, Denmark) fitted with a 1 mm screen, for later use. A commercial EOM (NOVATAN, Techna, France) was used in this study as a feed additive. According to the manufacturer, the main constituents in the EOM were cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and eugenol.</p>
