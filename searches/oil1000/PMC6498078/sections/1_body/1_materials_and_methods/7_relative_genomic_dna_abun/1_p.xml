<p class="p">To evaluate the efficiency (E) of amplification of each primer set, a 6-point standard curve and a nontemplate control (NTC) were run for each sample to test the relative expression levels. The standard curve was generated using genomic DNA (40 μg/reaction mixture), which was serially diluted. Amplification efficiency was calculated from the slope of the standard curve generated by plotting the threshold cycle (
