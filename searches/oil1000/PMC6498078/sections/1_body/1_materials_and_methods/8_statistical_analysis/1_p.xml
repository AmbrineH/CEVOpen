<p class="p">Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.3 (SAS institute Inc., NC, USA). The fixed effect in this model was a feed treatment. Orthogonal contrast was used to analyze linear and quadratic effect when the level of EOM supplementation increased. Differences among treatments were compared using Tukey’s range test if a significant effect was observed. Statistical significance was declared at p&lt;0.05 and a trend was speculated at 0.05≤p&lt;0.10.</p>
