 <italic class="italic">In vitro</italic> batch culture fermentation was carried out using rumen fluid, which was collected before the morning feeding from two cannulated Korean native cattle heifers (body weight 450±30 kg) at Center for Animal Science Research, Gyeongsang National University, Korea. Animals were fed a diet consisting of 600 g/kg timothy hay and 400 g/kg of a commercial concentrate mix. The rumen contents were mixed, transferred into a thermos bottle, and immediately transported to the laboratory. Rumen contents were strained through 4 layers of cheesecloth and mixed with 3× volumes of

Approximately 0.9 g DM of the ground experimental substrate and a corresponding quantity of EOM for each treatment were moved into pre-weighed filter bags (F57, Ankom Technology, Macedon, NY, USA). All bags were heat-sealed and transferred into empty 125 mL serum bottles, to which 50 mL of rumen fluid and buffer mixture were transferred accompanied by continuously flushing with O

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas. The bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps and incubated on a rotary shaker (JSSI-300T, JS Research Inc., Gongju, Korea) at 125 rpm, for 12 and 24 h at 39°C. Three replicates were prepared for each treatment and each incubation time. After each incubation period, the three replicates of each treatment were removed from the incubator, and total gas production was measured using a pressure transducer (Sun Bee Instrument Inc., Seoul, Korea) as described by Theodorou et al [

Subsequently, the bottles were immediately placed on ice and the caps were opened to stop the fermentation; the filter bags were removed from bottles and rinsed with flowing water until the water ran clear. The pH of the culture fluid was measured using a pH meter (FP20, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA). Sample fluid (5 mL) was stored at −80°C until rumen microbial population analysis. The remaining culture fluid was then centrifuged at 15,000×

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N) concentrations. The washed bags were dried at 55°C for 48 h and weighed to measure 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> DM degradability (IVDMD). The NDF content was assessed for the weighed bags using a modified version of the micro-NDF method proposed by Pell and Schofield [
 <xref rid="b15-ajas-18-0652" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] to evaluate 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> NDF degradability (IVNDFD).
