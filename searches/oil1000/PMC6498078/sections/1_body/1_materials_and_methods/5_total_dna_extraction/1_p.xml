 <italic class="italic">g</italic> and 4°C for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the remainder was resuspended in 800 μL of 1× phosphate-buffered saline solution to wash the pellet. This was recentrifuged (16,000×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>, 4°C, 5 min) and the supernatant was discarded. Total DNA was extracted from the washed pellet using a NucleoSpin DNA Stool kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH Co. KG, Düren, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and purity of total DNA were measured using a NanoDrop (ND-1000, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).
