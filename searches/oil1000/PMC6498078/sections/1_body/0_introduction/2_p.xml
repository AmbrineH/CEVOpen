<p class="p">In the previous studies, the separate use of individual EO (eugenol, thymol, and cinnamaldehyde) in an

Therefore, the use of essential oil mixtures (EOM) containing various EO has been widely assessed for the modulation of rumen fermentation, and the type and quantity of the EO in an EOM are the most important factors that determine their capability for modulating rumen fermentation [

Novatan (Techna, CouÃ«ron, France), a commercial EOM, has been developed for reducing excessive protein degradation in the rumen through the synergetic activity of EO (eugenol, thymol, and cinnamaldehyde) and microminerals (Na, Zn, and Mn) [
