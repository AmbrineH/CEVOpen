<p class="p">The addition of newly developed EOM to an 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> batch culture affected ruminal fermentation characteristics and microbial fold changes. An increased IVDMD and IVNDFD were observed when EOM was added. It was suggested that the newly developed EOM may be used as a feed additive to improve rumen fermentation. Further studies are required to investigate the detailed metabolic mechanism underlying the effects of EOM supplementation.
