<p id="Par4" class="p">In the follow-up to the earlier study, we added a superhydrophilic–underwater-oleophobic aluminium mesh to the multiphase liquid-separation system; this mesh could be used for successive separation of four-phase solution mixtures under gravity. The superhydrophilic–underwater-oleophobic mesh, superhydrophobic–superoleophilic mesh, and superhydrophobic–superoleophobic mesh of the system were designed to repel liquids with surface tensions (

Therefore, liquids with surface tensions of ≤21.6 mN/m, 21.6–32.0 mN/m, 32.0–50.8 mN/m and ≥50.8 mN/m could be separated from each other. Four liquids, whose surface tensions represent these target separation ranges—water (H

 <sub class="sub">5</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">12</sub>; 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sl</sub> = 15.8 mN/m)—were selected for this study. During the separation, diiodomethane, which was repelled by the superhydrophobic–superoleophobic, superhydrophobic–superoleophilic, and superhydrophilic–underwater-oleophobic meshes, was collected in the first beaker; water, which was repelled by the superhydrophobic–superoleophobic and superhydrophobic–superoleophilic meshes, was collected in a second beaker; 1,2-dichloroethane, which was repelled by the superhydrophobic–superoleophobic mesh, was collected in a third beaker; and pentane was collected in the fourth beaker after passing through the superhydrophobic–superoleophobic mesh. Furthermore, the meshes exhibited high separation efficiency for multiple four-phase liquid mixtures and excellent structural stability. In addition, a surface with regions of three different types of wetting was fabricated with a patterning technique to demonstrate that multiphase liquids can be separated by a single mesh. We believe that the information obtained in this study could greatly simplify the successive separation of many four-phase mixtures.
