<p id="Par3" class="p">To separate a multiphase liquid mixture whose components have similar surface energies, the surface of the separation system must be designed to allow accurate control of its wettability. More specifically, the filter should exhibit opposite wettability by the components in the mixture

 </sup>. In our earlier study, we fabricated aluminium meshes that could sequentially separate three different liquids from a mixture without any external assistance

 </sup>. However, we also discovered that a difference of 40 mN/m among components with surface energy in the range of 32.0–72.0 mN/m was too wide for efficient separation of the liquids. We believe that a novel mesh with superhydrophilicity–underwater-oleophobicity would allow successive separation of a liquid mixture with surface energy in the range of 32.0–50.8 mN/m in a simple, efficient, and economical manner. With this mesh, effective separation can be expected when the range of surface energy is reduced by half, and the difference between the surface tensions of individual components is limited to &lt;20 mN/m. Studies have shown that a superhydrophilic material can trap water on rough surfaces, and the trapped water greatly weakens the contact between oil and the superhydrophilic material, creating a superhydrophilic–oleophobic surface with low adhesion to the mesh
