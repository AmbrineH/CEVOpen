 </sup>. However, oil–water separation is not sufficient to meet the complex requirements in many industrial sectors, and successive separation systems for multiphase or organic liquid mixtures are needed. For example, successive separation processes are often necessary in various chemical applications such as anhydrous heterogeneous chemical reactions

 </sup>. However, because the continuous separation of multiphase liquids with small differences in surface energy is more difficult than the separation of liquids with large surface-energy differences, it has not been widely studied, and efficient execution of multiphase liquid separation remains a challenge.
