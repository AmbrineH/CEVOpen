<p id="Par12" class="p">Aluminium meshes with a pore size of 300 µm (50 mesh) were used as the substrates. First, an aluminium mesh was dipped in 3 M HCl solution at 80 °C for 30 s to form microstructures. Then, the microstructured aluminium mesh was anodized in 0.3 M oxalic acid solution at 26 °C under a constant current of 2.5 A for 25 min using a circulator (Lab Companion, RW-0525G) to form nanostructures on the microstructures. After complete washing and drying of the fabricated aluminium mesh, the mesh was ready for use. Three meshes with the same structure were coated with water to impart superhydrophilic–oleophobic characteristics for the preparation of a superhydrophobic-superoleophilic coating with OTS and a superhydrophobic-superoleophobic coating with HDFS.</p>
