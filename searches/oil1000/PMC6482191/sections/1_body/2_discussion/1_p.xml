<p id="Par11" class="p">A novel superhydrophilic–underwater-oleophobic mesh was successfully fabricated, and a multiphase liquid-separation system was fabricated using superhydrophilic–underwater-oleophobic, superhydrophobic–superoleophilic, and superhydrophobic–superoleophobic meshes for gravity-driven multiphase liquid separation. AFM images, EDS, contact-angle, and sliding-angle measurements demonstrated that these surfaces possessed the proper surface roughness and wettability required for efficient selective separation. The system showed high collection rates (≥98%) and high content ratios (≥96%) for various liquid mixtures. These results indicate that the fabricated meshes were chemically robust against various kinds of liquids that usually require filtration. In addition, we observed excellent collection rates (≥98%) and content ratios (≥92%) in 50 cycles of repeated separation. By adjusting the chemistry of the surface, we demonstrated that multiple liquids could be separated by one mesh whose patterned surface was modified to have heterogeneous wettability. Therefore, the present study is expected to contribute towards the development of advanced innovative liquid-separation systems with promising application in many practical situations.</p>
