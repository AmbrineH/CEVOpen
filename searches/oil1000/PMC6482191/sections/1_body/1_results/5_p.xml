 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(a)</xref>, the multiphase liquid-separation system used in our present work was quite simple. Before the liquid mixture was poured over the first mesh, the underwater-oleophobic mesh was pre-wetted with water, which was an essential step for successful separation. The liquids used in the separation experiments were pentane (with blue dye), 1,2-dichloroethane (with red dye), water (with green dye), and diiodomethane (natural yellowish colour). When the liquid mixture was poured into the separation system, the constituent liquids quickly passed through each mesh and collected in the accompanying beaker. The collection rate of each organic liquid mixture was calculated by the liquid collection rate coefficient (

 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic> is the collection rate, 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> is the mass of the liquid before separation, and 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">b</sub> is the mass of the liquid after separation. In order to more accurately evaluate the separation ability of the process, the content ratio of each collected liquid was measured. Separation experiments were performed using the 50, 100 and 200 meshes to demonstrate the separation efficiency according to mesh pore size. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> shows the collection rate and content ratio of the meshes with various pore sizes. It is clear that a mesh with a smaller pore size had a higher separation efficiency. Smaller pore sizes, however, are weak against physical forces, but the resulting increase in separation efficiency of a mesh is negligible. To verify the separation efficiency of the prepared filter, various organic liquid mixtures were prepared and separated using the same process. The first mixture consisted of water, diiodomethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and pentane; the second mixture consisted of water, diiodomethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and hexane; and the third mixture consisted of water, diiodomethane, chloroform, and pentane. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(b,c)</xref> show the collection rate and content ratio for separation of the four mixtures using the underwater-oleophobic, superoleophilic, and superoleophobic meshes, which all showed collection rates of &gt;98% and content ratios of &gt;96%. To evaluate the reusability of the prepared meshes, the efficiency of multiphase liquid separation was also investigated according to the number of separation cycles. The results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(d,e)</xref> show that the prepared meshes exhibited separation efficiencies that were not attenuated even after 50 cycles; the separation efficiencies of ≥92% suggest that the meshes were highly reusable and sufficiently stable.
