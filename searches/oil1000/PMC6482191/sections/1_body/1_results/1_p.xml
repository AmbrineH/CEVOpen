 </sup>. In particular, the hierarchical microscale and nanoscale structures of the meshes play important roles. The surface roughness of the microstructures formed by acid etching and anodizing of an aluminium mesh was investigated by analysing atomic force microscope (AFM) images of its surface. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows representative AFM three-dimensional views of the pristine and treated aluminium meshes, as well as their topographic height profiles. It can be clearly seen that the etching and anodizing processes resulted in a significant increase in the surface roughness, commonly represented by
