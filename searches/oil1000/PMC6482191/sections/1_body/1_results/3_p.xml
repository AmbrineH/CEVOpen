<p id="Par7" class="p">Our previous work proved that the fabricated hierarchical microcube–nanohole structured meshes (pore size: 300 µm) had superhydrophobic–superoleophobic and superhydrophobic–superoleophilic properties (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). In order to evaluate the performance of the meshes (pore size: 300 µm) in liquid separation, we further investigated their underwater wettability by oil. The wettability of the other two meshes with different pore sizes is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3(a)</xref> shows the wetting behaviour of diiodomethane on the mesh prepared after different coating cycles. The prepared prewetted mesh was underwater-oleophobic, with oil contact angles above 160°. In addition, the sliding angle was only 5.6° for the optimized mesh obtained after 10 coating cycles, indicating its low oil-adhesion property. The uncoated underwater-oleophobic mesh was hydrophilic in air and trapped water in the mesh. The trapped water increased the oleophobicity by reducing the contact area between the oil droplets and the mesh surface. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3(b)</xref> shows the wetting of the mesh surface by various oils. The contact angles of all oil droplets were greater than 154° and the sliding angles were less than 8°. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, the best as-prepared prewetted underwater-oleophobic mesh was used in the subsequent experiments.
