<p id="Par10" class="p">In order to create a patterned surface with multiple wettability in one mesh, the surface was modified by an alkyltrichlorosilane coating and UV photopatterning, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6(a)</xref>. The hierarchical microcube–nanohole structured mesh was first dipped in an OTS coating solution. The OTS-coated mesh was then exposed to UV light through a photomask. The alkyl chain of OTS at the irradiated sites was completely decomposed by photochemical reactor after 2 h of UV exposure

 </sup>. HDFS coating and patterning were performed using similar procedures. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6(b)</xref> shows an optical image of the developed patterned surface with heterogeneous surface energies. The surface consisted of an HDFS-coated area (superhydrophobic–superoleophobic) (I), an OTS-coated area (superhydrophobic–superoleophilic) (II), and an uncoated area (superhydrophilic–underwater-oleophobic) (III). Thus, if the coating materials on the hierarchical microcube–nanohole structured mesh were selected in terms of the desired wettability for the target solutions, a patterned surface with a wide range of wetting properties could be obtained. In addition, by simply changing the order of the patterns on the surface, the four liquid mixtures could be separated by only one mesh. All these results demonstrate that this system with underwater-oleophobic, superoleophobic, and superoleophilic meshes exhibited excellent separation efficiency and will contribute to the development of advanced multiphase liquid separation for practical applications.
