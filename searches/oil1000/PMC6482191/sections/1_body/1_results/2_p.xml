 </sup>. After an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) coating was formed on the underwater-oleophobic mesh, an additional carbon peak was observed in the spectrum, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2(b)</xref>. The atomic ratio of carbon increased to 22.66%. The survey spectrum shows peaks corresponding to three elements—Al, C, and O—which indicate that OTS was successfully absorbed on the surface of the aluminium mesh. Unlike the ED spectrum of the uncoated underwater-oleophobic mesh and OTS-coated superoleophilic mesh, the ED spectrum of the superoleophobic aluminium mesh surface, obtained by coating a clean aluminium mesh with heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2,-tetrahydrodecyl trichlorosilane (HDFS), exhibits an additional fluorine peak corresponding to an atomic ratio of 7.07%.
