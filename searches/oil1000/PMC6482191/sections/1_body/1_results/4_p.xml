The liquids used in the separation test were water, diiodomethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and pentane. When the mixture of liquids was poured over the superoleophobic mesh, water, diiodomethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane were retained, while the pentane component passed through. Thereafter, with selective permeation of 1,2-dichloroethane through the superoleophilic mesh, the residual 1,2-dichloroethane was separated from the retained water and diiodomethane. After that, water passed through the underwater-oleophobic mesh, but diiodomethane was blocked. No immiscible liquid was observed after the complete sequence of filtration processes. Because the liquids used in the test can be replaced with other liquids, the fabricated mesh can be used to sequentially separate various mixtures of four immiscible liquids.
