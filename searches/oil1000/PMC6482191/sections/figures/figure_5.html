 <p> ( a) Separation of various liquid mixtures; the liquid mixtures consisting of diiodomethane (with originally yellow), 1,2-dichloroethane (with red dye), water (with green dye), and pentane (with blue dye) were effectively separated by the as-prepared meshes. ( b) Collection rate and ( c) content ratio of various liquids separated by 50 mesh. ( d) Collection rate and ( e) content ratio of liquids that were separated from the multiphase liquid mixture versus the cycle number. </p>
