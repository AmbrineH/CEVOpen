 <p> ( a) Schematic illustration of multiphase liquid separation. ( b– d) Separation process of multiphase liquid mixture consisting of water (H 2O), diiodomethane (CH 2I 2), 1,2-dichloroethane (C 2H 4Cl 2), and pentane (C 5H 12): ( b) the separated H 2O was collected and no other liquids were observed; ( c) C 2H 4Cl 2 was separated from the newly prepared H 2O—CH 2I 2—C 2H 4Cl 2 mixture; ( d) after addition of a small quantity of water to the mesh, the separated CH 2I 2 was collected from the newly prepared H 2O–CH 2I 2 mixture. </p>
