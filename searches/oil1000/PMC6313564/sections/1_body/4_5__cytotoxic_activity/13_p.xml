 <xref rid="B94-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] and monoterpenoidsâ€™ cytotoxic activities may produce alterations of lipidic fractions and consequently changes in membrane properties. Different EOs or their main components have been shown to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in human cancer cells. In these cells, EOs can provoke both mitochondrial membrane depolarization [

Additionally, as visible by SEM observations, the permeabilization of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes leads to cell death by apoptosis and necrosis (
