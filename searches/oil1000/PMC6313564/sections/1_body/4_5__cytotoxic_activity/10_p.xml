 <italic class="italic">Mentha suaveolens</italic> plants that were collected in various regions of Morocco contained from 65% to 90% of monoterpenes, oxides, terpenic, and terpenic ketones in their EOs. Recently, Mangone et al. [

In this study, the researchers evaluated the cellular metabolism of cancer cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after different treatment with EOs at different times of incubation. Moreover, morphological and ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy analysis were performed to understand the EOsâ€™ cytotoxic action against SKBR3 human cancer cells (

 <italic class="italic">Mentha suaveolens</italic> EO for 24 h at 0.003 mg/mL are shown. Cells appeared damaged on the plasma membrane, with many superficial alterations.
