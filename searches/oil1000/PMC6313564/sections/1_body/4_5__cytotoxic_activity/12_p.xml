In studies of cancer cells, electron microscopes are instruments that produce a largely magnified image by using electrons instead of light to form an image. TEM and SEM microscopies allow us to study the ultrastructural details of biological samples, and in this case, it is possible to see the changes induced by treatment with several types of agents such as drugs and natural products as EOs. Moreover, it allows us to study the development of any pathological situations, as well as any changes in environmental conditions.
