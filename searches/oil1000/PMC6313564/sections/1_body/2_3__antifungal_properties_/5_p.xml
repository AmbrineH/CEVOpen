 <xref rid="medicines-05-00112-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> EOs against some human pathogenic fungi. The genus that has been most investigated was 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., followed by dermatophytes and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. suaveolens</italic> EOs have been studied more than 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. longifolia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. pulegium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">M. cervinia</italic>. The method that has been more frequently used was a microbroth dilution, rather than disk diffusion.
