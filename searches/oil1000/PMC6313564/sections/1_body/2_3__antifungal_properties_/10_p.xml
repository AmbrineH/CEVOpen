<p class="p">Indeed, Soković et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] reported the fungistatic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> in the macrodilution and microdilution methods, with values of MIC of 1335 μg/mL to 2670 μg/mL in ethanol and 445 μg/mL to 1335 μg/mL in Tween against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. and dermatophytes. In addition, Sokovic et al. reported the antifungal activity of some main compounds, such as 1–8 cineole, menthol, limonene, and carvone, as shown in 
 <xref rid="medicines-05-00112-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Better activity was reported for 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Similar results were reported by Khoury et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>], with values of MIC of 512 µg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">Tricophitum rubrum,</italic> while high values of MIC were reported by others [
 <xref rid="B62-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] ranging from 2% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> to 3% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> and corresponding to about 1780 μg/mL to 2670 μg/mL. Adam et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] reported antifungal activity from 25 mm to 40 mm for disk diffusion and 0.25 μg/mL for microbroth dilutions. 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> EO possesses greater fungistatic activity than 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> EO against dermatophytes.
