 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. is the most frequent pathogen in humans and animals. Azole-resistant Candida and Aspergillus species are the pathogens that are responsible for nosocomial or food-borne infections. Although

 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>. There is emerging evidence from different parts of the world of the increasing resistance of 
 <italic class="italic">CA</italic> and non-
 <italic class="italic">CA</italic> species to antifungal agents such as triazoles and echinocandins, which are used in medicinal practice [
