 <italic class="italic">M. pulegium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. cervina,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. suaveolens</italic> have been used to evaluate antifungal activity against different species. Their antifungal activity was evaluated by a variety of different protocols. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of a drug that prevents the visible growth of a microorganism. It can be determined by culturing microorganisms in liquid media. Other studies have also reported the disk diffusion method (DDA), which measures the sensitivity of microorganisms to antibiotics by culturing microorganisms on solid growth media surrounding the sources of the drug.
