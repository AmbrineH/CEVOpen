<p class="p">The biamperometric antioxidant capacity assay also uses the redox couple ABTS+/ABTS. The ABTS cation radical (ABTS+) [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], which absorbs at 743 nm (giving a green color), is formed by the loss of an electron by the nitrogen atom of ABTS. In the presence of Trolox (or another hydrogen-donating antioxidant), the nitrogen atom quenches the hydrogen atom, causing the solution’s decolorization. ABTS can be oxidized by potassium persulfate [
