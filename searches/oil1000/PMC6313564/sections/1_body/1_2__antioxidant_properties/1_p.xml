<p class="p">In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the consumption of EOs as natural antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B16-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. It is well-known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause damage to cellular macromolecules, and they are implicated in the development of many human diseases. Under many pathological conditions the oxidation–reduction (redox) potential imbalance cannot remove excessive amounts of ROS [

Excessive nitric oxide (NO) production and increased levels of prooxidant species may lead to damage and poor perfusion of the vital organs of the host, contributing to multiple organ failure; thus, to counteract this response, antioxidant pathways are activated [
