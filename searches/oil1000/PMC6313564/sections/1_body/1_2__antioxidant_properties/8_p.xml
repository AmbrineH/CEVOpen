<p class="p">Recently, similar results were confirmed by Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], specifically the action of peppermint EO as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, and the potential for it to be an antioxidant at concentrations ≥200 μg/mL. da Silva Ramos et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported an antioxidant activity of 79.9 ± 1.6% and IC

 <xref rid="B32-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] have described low antioxidant activity. More probably, the antioxidant actions of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> may be due to the presence of phenolic constituents in its leaves, including rosmarinic acid and different flavonoids such as rutin, naringin, eriocitrin, luteolin, and hesperidin, which are present in aqueous extracts [

 <xref rid="B34-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], but not in the essential oil. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> EO is associated with increased levels of intracellular ROS, which is indicative of an apoptotic process [
