 <italic class="italic">Mentha suaveolens</italic> Ehrh is a communal wild plant that is found near streams, bogs, and humid places. There are different subspecies, each including several varieties. El-Askary et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] reported a potent antioxidant activity in vivo, which was about 96% relative to vitamin E, while Ferreira et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] described the AChE inhibitory capacity as higher than 50% in the essential oil fraction of 
 <italic class="italic">M. suaveolens</italic>. The antioxidant capacity in this case is due to piperitone oxide being present at 88% [
 <xref rid="B45-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Other authors have reported no relevant antioxidant activity for this species [
 <xref rid="B46-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Some 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> spp. have not been assessed for antioxidant activity as yet. 
 <xref rid="medicines-05-00112-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> reports antioxidant information about
