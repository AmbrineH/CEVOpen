<p class="p">The main reaction occurring in spectrometric techniques is between a radical, radical cation, or a complex and an antioxidant molecule donor of a hydrogen atom. DPPH is a stable free radical, and the assay is based on electron transfer that produces a purple solution in ethanol, with an absorption band with a maximum of around 520 nm. When DPPH reacts with a hydrogen donor, it generates the reduced molecular form (DPPH), and the purple color disappears. The antioxidant concentration is linearly correlated with the absorbance diminution. The standard antioxidant used is Trolox. The standard curve was linear between 25â€“800 mM Trolox [
