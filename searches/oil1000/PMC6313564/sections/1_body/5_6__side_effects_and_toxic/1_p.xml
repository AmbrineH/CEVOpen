<p class="p">Numerous publications describe the toxicity of EOs, especially for humans, because despite them being natural substances, whether they are safe is not certain. They are produced by plants in order to protect themselves from parasites and insects, and prevent germination during the winter. For these reasons, they could be toxic for human use, and they should always be used with caution. Toxicity can be local or systemic, which is due to the composition of EOs. At first, the composition of EOs must be verified by gas chromatography because composition and toxicity vary according to different factors such as the seasonal period in which they are collected, the ecotype, the part of the plant from which they are extracted, and the place where the oils are harvested [

The risk assessment of EOs for human consumption is very important, particularly for vulnerable populations such us children and pregnant women. Unfortunately, unlike with typical regulated drugs, rigorous scientific tests have not been established for the safety of EOs. Toxicology studies in mice have revealed that
