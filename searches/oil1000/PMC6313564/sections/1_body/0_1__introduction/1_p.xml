<p class="p">Plant essential oils (EOs) are produced predominantly using steam distillation, but can also be generated using fermentation, crushing, extraction, hydrolysis, and airing [
 <xref rid="B1-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. EOs are used extensively in cosmetics in many different aspects as perfumes, in antiseptic applications, and in domestic cleaning products [

 <xref rid="B3-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. They are volatile liquids or semi-liquids [
 <xref rid="B4-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] that are limpid, but are rarely colored, and are soluble in organic solvents. All of the organs of the plants can synthesize EOs, which are stored in secretory compartments as cavities, canals, epidermic cells, or glandular trichomes. EOs are complex mixtures of terpenoides containing sesquiterpene and monoterpene, and their oxygenated derivatives. EOs may also incorporate a variety of other molecules such as fatty acids, oxides, and sulfur derivatives [
 <xref rid="B5-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Both the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid families, which are sometimes identified as the principal constituents of several EOs, can constitute 85% of the total concentration of the oil. There are about 3000 well-recognized EOs, of which 300 are widely sold [
 <xref rid="B6-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Various factors influence the chemical compositions of EOs, such as their geographic location, the seasonal period in which they are collected, the soil composition and cultivation method, their storage, and the oil extraction method [

 <xref rid="B8-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The high level of interest in research regarding EOs is due to their many biological and medical properties [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-05-00112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. They are generally recognized as safe, and they can act synergistically with other compounds, which are promising factors for their use as bioactive compounds [
