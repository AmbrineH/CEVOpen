<p class="p">Our understanding of the beneficial effects of dietary EPA and DHA on human health has been based largely on three main lines of evidence including epidemiological studies, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and laboratory studies investigating biochemical and molecular mechanisms that have provided considerable mechanistic support to the in vivo approaches [

 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Based on all the evidence, many recommendations for EPA and DHA intake for a healthy human diet have been produced by a large number of global and national health agencies and associations, and government bodies [

 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The recommendations of over 50 organizations were compiled by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega 3 s [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and, based on the most commonly recommended dose for cardiac health (500 mg/person/day), the total demand for n-3 LC-PUFA can easily be calculated (500 mg/day × 365 days × 7 billion) to amount to over 1.27 million tonnes [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In contrast to the considerable research into the benefits of dietary n-3 LC-PUFA, EPA and DHA, on human health, and the amelioration of several pathological conditions [

 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], which has resulted in the plethora of dietary recommendations [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], few studies on humans have even considered where all the n-3 LC-PUFA would come from if the dietary recommendations were followed by the human population. However, three studies have attempted to calculate the difference between the demand to satisfy human physiological requirements and the actual available supply of EPA and DHA [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,

 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. While the calculation of human requirements (demand) is relatively simple, calculating the available supply of n-3 LC-PUFA is not, and requires various assumptions and estimates [see 2]. However, despite this, all three studies came to the same conclusion, that the available supply of n-3 LC-PUFA was insufficient to meet the demand to satisfy human requirements [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,

 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Indeed, in the journal issue, which was dedicated to n-3 LC-PUFA and that contained the latest study to calculate n-3 LC-PUFA supply [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], the editors chose to highlight the question “where will all the omega-3 fatty acids come from” in the journal editorial [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Therefore, while the supply of n-3 LC-PUFA can be optimistically estimated at just over 0.8 million tonnes indicating a shortfall of more than 0.4 million tonnes [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] or, more pessimistically the deficit in supply has been calculated at over 1 million tonnes [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], the fact that a significant gap exists is not in question irrespective of how it is calculated [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the relentless increase in the global population translates into ever-growing demand.
