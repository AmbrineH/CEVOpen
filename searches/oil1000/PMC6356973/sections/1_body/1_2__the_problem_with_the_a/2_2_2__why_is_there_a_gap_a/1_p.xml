<p class="p">The calculations of supply in Tocher [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] highlight that the limitation in availability of EPA and DHA is linked to their aquatic, predominantly marine, origin as oceans accounts for 96.5% of all water on earth. While a very recent study has revealed that n-3 PUFA can be synthesised 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> in some marine invertebrates [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], the vast majority is produced at the base of the marine food web in marine microbes, including predominantly microalgae [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], whereas terrestrial plants do not produce EPA or DHA [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Consequently, our supplies of n-3 LC-PUFA come from the oceans, the majority (almost 90%) from capture fisheries, whether as food fish or via fish oil and fishmeal, with relatively small additional amounts estimated from seafood by-products and recycling, unfed aquaculture and traditional macroalgal sources [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Therefore, while other animal-derived foods can contribute small amounts of n-3 LC-PUFA [
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], access to, and consumption of, fish and seafood is the major factor in determining how the diet of individuals and populations around the globe can satisfy n-3 LC-PUFA requirements. Indeed, a recent global survey of blood levels of EPA and DHA reported that “populations living on coastal regions of countries, and populations that traditionally rely on hunting, fishing and gathering for sustenance tended to have moderate to high blood levels of EPA+DHA” and concluded that, while there was considerable variability in blood levels of EPA+DHA, “the very low to low range of blood EPA+DHA for most of the world may increase global risk for chronic disease” [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In addition, public perceptions of fish, especially oily fish, leading to consumer resistance [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], as well and various lifestyle choices [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] can also impact intake of n-3 LC-PUFA. In consequence, a very large global study into consumption of dietary fats including 266 country-specific surveys, showed that the global mean consumption of n-3 LC-PUFA was 163 mg/day [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. While there was variation in n-3 LC-PUFA consumption at both regional and national levels [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], the mean value was well below the lowest recommended level for intake of around 250 mg/day [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. It is in this context that the fundamental, global lack of n-3 LC-PUFA to supply human needs for a healthy diet must be considered.
