<p class="p">All of the above represent further options for “harvesting” EPA and DHA, which is simply applying a 19/20th century approach. It is clear that we require entirely new (
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic>) supplies of EPA and DHA and this, in turn, requires completely different approaches. In other words, we must generate the EPA and DHA that we require, rather than simply recycle it. One approach has been to apply modern technology to “farm” the marine organisms (i.e., the microalgae) that make the EPA and DHA in the first place. While feasible, this option has required advances in industrial technologies to enable scale-up of fermentation of heterotrophic species and/or bioreactor-like culture of phototrophic species [
