<p class="p">As EPA and DHA are naturally produced essentially only in the marine environment, that has been an area of focus for efforts to find new sources. Such initiatives include other unexploited fisheries, such as mesopelagic fish species, or fishing down the trophic levels, including zooplankton such as krill or copepods. These options have been the subject of other reviews [

 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and further detailed review of these options is beyond the scope of this article. Suffice to say that, other than a relatively small commercial krill fishery that provides limited amounts of krill meal and oil, other marine options have, so far, not provided a solution to the problem of the supply of EPA and DHA [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Similarly, recycling activities such as extracting oils from the by-products of wild capture fisheries and aquaculture is already occurring, but is more an issue of efficiency in the use of existing, ultimately marine-derived, sources and not new supplies of n-3 LC-PUFA [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Therefore, while obviously desirable, recycling cannot be the solution to a problem that is only going to get bigger, i.e., the demand will constantly increase due to population growth, as increasing efficiency by reducing waste can only ever maximise the use of the existing, limited supplies.
