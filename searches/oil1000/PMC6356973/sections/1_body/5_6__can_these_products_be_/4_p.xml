<p class="p">Peer-reviewed data on trials investigating the use of oils from genetically engineered oilseed crops is fragmentary, being quite comprehensive in the case of GM Camelina, but more elusive in others. An early study showed that oil derived from an GM oilseed crop could be used in aquafeeds without any apparent negative effects related to “GM” [
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. While this was a stearidonic (18:4n-3)-containing oil from genetically engineered soybean, and so not a direct source of EPA or DHA, it at least proved the general concept. While information on trials involving oils derived from GM canola is sparse, recent conference reports indicate that they have both been used successfully in trials generally replacing the fish oil component in feeds for Atlantic salmon [

 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. In all these studies, the modified camelina oils have been used to replace both fish oil and vegetable oil, showing that they can directly replace all the added oil in feeds without negative impacts on fish growth or health. The most recent study showed that replacing both fish oil and rapeseed oil with a camelina oil containing &gt; 25% n-3 LC-PUFA doubled the EPA+DHA level in the flesh of the salmon compared to fish fed the current commercial standard feed [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], suggesting that this oil could restore levels in harvest-size salmon to those last seen more than a decade ago before the development of sustainable feeds with high replacement of marine ingredients [
