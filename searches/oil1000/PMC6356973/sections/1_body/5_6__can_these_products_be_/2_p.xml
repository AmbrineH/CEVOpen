 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00089-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> briefly summarises fish feeding trials using some potential new sources of EPA and DHA. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of all trials involving microalgal or GM sources of n-3 LC-PUFA. 
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00089-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> is restricted to the products listed in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00089-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, or similar, related materials tested as part of the development process, and limited to published and/or publicly available data. Further details of studies on the use of microalgal products, largely biomasses, in on-growing feeds, as opposed to larval feeds, was briefly reviewed recently [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In summary, there have been several trials with a variety of algal biomasses in recent years with generally positive results, although there are two caveats. Firstly, biomasses cannot directly replace the oil component of fish feeds due to the presence of protein and, especially carbohydrate (largely non-starch polysaccharide, NSP) and this can limit the total amount that can be incorporated into optimally balanced feeds without negative impacts.
