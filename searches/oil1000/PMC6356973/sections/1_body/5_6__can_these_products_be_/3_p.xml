However, when it comes to metabolic and physiological control and regulation, EPA and DHA both have important and different, albeit overlapping, roles. A detailed examination and appreciation of their respective roles in controlling metabolism (e.g., as ligands for transcription factors etc.) and also in inflammation, the key fundamental step in the response to any injury or infection and the immune system, is outwith the scope of this review, and is covered elsewhere [
