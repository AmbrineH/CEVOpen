<p class="p">Of course, ensuring that farmed fish can deliver high levels of EPA+DHA to human consumers would require much higher levels to be included in the fish feed. This would mean using the new sources not to replace some of the fish oil, but to replace the vegetable oil currently used in feeds. How to implement this strategy would depend upon the fish species. Fish with low flesh fat content, like many marine species, will require less dietary EPA+DHA to increase the proportions of these fatty acids in the flesh, which is good, but they will not deliver the same ‘dose’ of EPA+DHA to human consumers that an oily species like salmon can. However, for farmed salmon to deliver this high dose it requires high levels of EPA+DHA in the feed. This will not be possible with microalgal biomasses that cannot be incorporated into the feeds of salmonids, or marine fish, at the required high levels due to the presence in the biomasses of substantial amounts of carbohydrates that, irrespective of the exact type of carbohydrate, have very low nutritional value in carnivorous fish species with limited ability to utilise dietary carbohydrate of any type [
