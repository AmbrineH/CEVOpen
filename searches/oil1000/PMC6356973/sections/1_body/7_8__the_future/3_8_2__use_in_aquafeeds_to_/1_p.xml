<p class="p">While the initial priority may be to supply sufficient dietary EPA and DHA to ensure fish health and at least maintain current levels in farmed products [
 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], the ultimate goal should be to significantly increase dietary levels so that farmed fish can deliver similar or higher levels of n-3 LC-PUFA than wild fish. This will establish farmed fish as the best way by far for people to supplement their diets with “omega-3” and confirm fish as key components of a healthy balanced diet.
