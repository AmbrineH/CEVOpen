<p class="p">In contrast, oils with lower proportions of total n-3 LC-PUFA may be less than ideal for oily species like salmon in which flesh fatty acid composition closely reflects dietary fatty acid compositions. However, this may be less important in species that have lower levels of lipid in their flesh and where a greater proportion of EPA and DHA in flesh lipid will be present in phospholipids rather than in triacylglycerol [

Thus, the oils from other GM plants, which contain around 10â€“12% total n-3 LC-PUFA could arguably be best used in feeds for non-oily marine fish such as sea bream and sea bass, as well as crustaceans (shrimp and prawns). These oils are also characterised by being either predominantly EPA (BASF/Cargill) or DHA (Nuseed/CSIRO) that, as discussed briefly above, both have important but different metabolic and physiological roles. Assuming that some balance between these two key n-3 LC-PUFA is desirable, albeit precisely what the optimum balance might be is unknown, a blend of these two oils may be more beneficial than either individually, with a 1:1 blend probably a reasonable starting point.
