<p class="p">As alluded to above, microalgal biomasses can be included in feeds for carnivorous species to only a limited extent, at least partly due to the carbohydrate content that is relatively high, possibly 10–30% depending upon species albeit details of carbohydrate compositions are difficult to obtain for any the biomasses or

 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. Most, if not all, of the carbohydrate is assumed to be NSP, likely associated with the cell wall that, in addition to being indigestible may further impact digestion of other nutrients, and so generally only 5–6% of algal biomasses can be incorporated in feeds for salmon without compromising growth [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Fish species at lower trophic levels, specifically herbivorous/omnivorous fish such as carps, tilapia and pangasius, may have (slightly) better capacity to digest cell walls, if they have β-glucan components, due to the possible presence in the intestine of enzyme activities (e.g., cellulases), whether of endogenous or, more likely, microbial origin [
 <xref rid="B100-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. Therefore, if these species were more tolerant of algal biomasses, and able to better digest biomass, increasing bioavailability of protein, lipid and minerals [

However, these species are produced in huge tonnages and are important components of human diets in many parts of the world, especially Asia and Africa, and so improvement of their nutritional value through increased levels of DHA could benefit a very large number of people, many of whom have low levels of n-3 LC-PUFA in blood [
