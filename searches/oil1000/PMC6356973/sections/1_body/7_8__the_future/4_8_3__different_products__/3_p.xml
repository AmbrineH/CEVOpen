<p class="p">The high EPA+DHA oils such as the microalgal oil, Veramaris
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, and the oil from genetically engineered Camelina, would be ideal for improving the n-3 LC-PUFA content of oily species such as the salmonids, especially salmon, where flesh fat (muscle lipid) is dominated by triacylgycerol whose fatty acid composition closely reflects the fatty acid composition of the diet [
 <xref rid="B104-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. This is the most efficient way of passing the high levels of EPA and DHA in these products on to human consumers via farmed fish. With the microalgal oil, suitably high dietary levels of EPA+DHA would not necessarily require the oil to be included at 100% of the added dietary oil. Due to the high proportion of n-3 LC-PUFA in the microalgal oil, near twice the level found in southern hemisphere fish oil, a 50:50 blend with rapeseed oil could probably restore EPA+DHA levels in farmed salmon to that of a decade ago before the development of sustainable feeds [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. An alternative would be to just use one oil at 100% of the added oil and this is precisely what the GM Camelina crop was designed to provide. The modified camelina seed oil contains 20–25% n-3 LC-PUFA and, when used to replace both FO and rapeseed oil, the level of n-3 LC-PUFA in flesh was doubled, suggesting that it could restore levels in harvest-size fish to those of more than a decade ago, prior to the development of sustainable feeds [
