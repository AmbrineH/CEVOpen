<p class="p">The above discussion simply aligns biochemical/nutrient composition data of the various new sources of n-3 LC-PUFA with biological/physiological characteristics of aquaculture species and suggests some potential matches. While these considerations could clearly aid the efficient utilisation of EPA and DHA in the human food chain, it is acknowledged that market forces underpinned by many other economic and socio- and geo-political factors will be equally important drivers for the new n-3 LC-PUFA value chain. </p>
