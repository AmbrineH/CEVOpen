<p class="p">The above has demonstrated that the new sources can, to varying degrees depending upon precise fatty acid composition, supply EPA and/or DHA and, therefore, supplement the existing supplies of fish oil that will always be finite and limiting. But what exactly will be the future for all these varied products? How will they be used and how will their different origins and compositions affect their use? While this article has focused on the different biological and chemical characteristics of the new sources, they also vary in the way their use could be impacted by socio-economic and socio-political issues. While the microalgal products may have price implications associated with the relatively high cost of production [

Furthermore, the gap between supply and demand was based on the calculated ‘physiological demand’, which is different to ‘commercial demand’. The latter currently includes demand from the direct human consumption (capsule) market, as well as potential future demand from other animal feed (poultry and pig) sectors, but the main driver will likely continue to be the aquaculture sector. However, even within aquaculture, the use of the different new sources will not only be dependent upon biological and technical factors of feed formulation and manufacture, but also the overall aim and ambition of the sector, which is currently not clear and likely to be driven by market forces dependent upon availability of supply and cost.
