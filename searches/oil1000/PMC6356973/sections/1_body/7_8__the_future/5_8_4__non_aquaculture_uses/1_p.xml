<p class="p">As long as there is a limited supply, aquaculture will remain the ideal delivery system for n-3 LC-PUFA to human consumers. As well as fish and seafood being well appreciated by consumers as the traditional way to obtain these key nutrients, aquaculture production is generally far more efficient than any terrestrial animal production [
 <xref rid="B105-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Thus, highly efficient species such as Atlantic salmon [
 <xref rid="B106-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>] feed conversion ratio (FCR) of around 1.1 to 1.2 in commercial production, compared to ~2 for poultry, ~3 for pigs, and &gt; 6 for lamb and beef [
 <xref rid="B105-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. In addition, salmon show higher protein, energy and n-3 LC-PUFA retentions, and harvest and edible yields than terrestrial meat production [
 <xref rid="B105-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. However, there can be further options if there were sufficient supplies of n-3 LC-PUFA to support other animal feed uses as well as direct human consumption. Although not such an efficient way of utilising EPA and DHA, supplementation of feeds for monogastric animals like pigs, and poultry (broilers and layers), could increase n-3 LC-PUFA levels in pork [
 <xref rid="B107-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>], chicken [
 <xref rid="B108-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>] and eggs [
 <xref rid="B109-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>] as in the past when feeds for these animals often contained fishmeal [
 <xref rid="B110-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. Supplementation of feeds for ruminants such as cattle or sheep will only be sensible if good encapsulation methods were available to protect the fatty acids in the rumen and prevent loss by biohydrogenation [
 <xref rid="B111-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. Supplementation of other food groups with EPA and DHA is also a possible option especially after microencapsulation, and has been used with milk, cheese, yoghurt, bread and juice [
 <xref rid="B112-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>,
 <xref rid="B113-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. The more widespread availability of EPA and DHA in food may appear a long-term goal but one that has historically received attention in relation to human dietary requirements [
 <xref rid="B114-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. In 2011, the Omega-3 summit recommended a “Dietary intake of &gt; 1000 mg of n-3 LC-PUFA was needed if consuming a western-type diet”, which was indicating that current dietary recommendations [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] may be insufficient to ensure a balanced healthy diet [
 <xref rid="B115-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. This was further discussed at the recent 2018 Omega-3 Summit conference that held four key debate sessions, “Strategies for Increased use of n-3 LC-PUFA for Improving Health”, “Matching Omega-3 Requirements with Omega-3 Supplies”, “Strategies for the Industry to Improve the Global Intake of n-3 LC-PUFA” and “Strategies for Food and Food Ingredients Industry to Deliver n-3 LC-PUFA to Consumers Worldwide in a Sustainable Way” [
