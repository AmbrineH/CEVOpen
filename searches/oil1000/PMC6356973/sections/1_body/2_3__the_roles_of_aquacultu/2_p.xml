<p class="p">The limitation in the supply of EPA and DHA has been an issue in aquaculture for over 20 years. Initially the response was dictated by market forces that drove up prices of fish oil and fishmeal, which naturally balanced demand to the existing supply. Thus, as aquaculture and the required feed volumes expanded, the limited amount of fishmeal and fish oil was spread thinner and thinner across the feeds, with fish oil being increasingly replaced by vegetable oils devoid of n-3 LC-PUFA, but often containing high levels of n-6 PUFA [
