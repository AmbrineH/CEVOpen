<p class="p">However, this is not only an impact on human consumers, because it also has potential consequences for the health of farmed fish themselves [

Thus, just as n-3 LC-PUFA are essential components of a healthy diet in humans, so they are in all vertebrates, including fish, and therefore replacing these in the diet with n-6 PUFA is actually having the same effect in fish as has happened in humans, with diets now having an imbalance of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Therefore, it has long been appreciated that continued, progressive dilution of the levels of n-3 LC-PUFA in aquafeeds may impact upon the health of farmed fish, and so was an ultimately unsustainable strategy [
