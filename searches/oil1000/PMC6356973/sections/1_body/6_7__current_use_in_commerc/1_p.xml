<p class="p">Algal biomasses are already being used in commercial aquafeeds. ForPlus™ is currently being included in the formulation of a number of feeds produced by Alltech
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Coppens including for salmonids (e.g., the fishmeal and fish-oil-free “Neogreen” feed) and marine species, as well as broodstock diets for freshwater species, although the exact amounts incorporated in the feeds are unknown [

 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. The joint venture between Terravia and Bunge resulted in a new large fermentation facility being established at a Bunge site in Brazil processing sugarcane. This close association of algal production with the fermentation feedstock increased the production volume of AlgaPrime™ DHA enabling an agreement for Terravia/Bunge (now Corbion) to supply this product to the BioMar Group for inclusion in fish feed [

 <sup class="sup">®</sup> with a new fermentation facility being built in Nebraska to use US corn syrup as fermentation feedstock, with initial production capacity upon commercial release in 2019 projected to meet up to 15% of the total current annual demand for EPA and DHA by the global salmon aquaculture industry based on current inclusion levels [
