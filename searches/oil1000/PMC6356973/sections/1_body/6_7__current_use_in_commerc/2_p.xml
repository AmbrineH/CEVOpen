<p class="p">The development of GM

 <sup class="sup">®</sup> salmon are now being produced using microalgae, rather than GM yeast biomass, although the precise source and nature of the microalgal product is not known. While none of the GM oilseed oils are yet fully commercialised both the groups involved in developing GM canola are actively seeking approval for planting of the elite canola events they wish to commercialise through the publication in the USA of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) “Petition for non-regulatory status” [
