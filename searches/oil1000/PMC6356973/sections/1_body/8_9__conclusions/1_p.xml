<p class="p">The present review has highlighted the fundamental problem of inadequate supplies of n-3 LC-PUFA to satisfy human physiological requirements, briefly summarised the potential new sources of these key nutrients, and provided some analysis of how these new products could be used effectively. The overall conclusion is that all the new sources can have important roles to play in helping to support healthy, balanced diets for people. The variety of new sources of EPA and DHA coming to market will be highly beneficial as they can be targeted to different uses and, as they all find their niche markets, this could help to draw down prices making their widespread use increasingly feasible.</p>
