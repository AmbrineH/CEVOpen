<p class="p">While the omega-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n-3) acids, can be produced endogenously by humans and some fish species [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], their rate of biosynthesis is low and insufficient to meet physiological demands [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00089-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, EPA and DHA are well accepted as being essential components of a healthy, balanced diet, having beneficial effects on development especially of the neural system [

 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and in mitigating a number of pathological conditions [

 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, what is not so well known or appreciated is that these nutrients are in short supply [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. There is simply not enough available from all the traditional sources to satisfy human nutritional requirements, and aquaculture, both as a major user and provider of EPA and DHA, has been at the forefront in highlighting this gap between demand and supply, and driving the omega-3 research agenda [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In recent years, this has led to considerable academic and industry interest in developing entirely new supplies of n-3 LC-PUFA and this has resulted in various products that are already in production or likely to go forward to commercial production [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The present article briefly summarises the reasons behind the current gap in supply and demand, the role of aquaculture, the new products likely to be available commercially in the near future and longer term, and the opportunities and options these entirely novel sources of n-3 LC-PUFA can provide in helping to promote balanced and healthy human diets.
