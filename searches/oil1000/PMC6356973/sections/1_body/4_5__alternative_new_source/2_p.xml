<p class="p">The purpose of 
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00089-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> is simply to give the reader an appreciation of the range of potential new sources of EPA and DHA and how they differ in some key characteristics that may influence how they are used. In this context, there are essentially only two main options for 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> production of EPA and DHA, microalgae and genetically-modified oil producing organisms, particularly oilseed crops. The microalgal sources are currently largely derived from the production of Thraustochytrid species such as 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> and, occasionally, dinoflagellates like 
 <italic class="italic">Crypthecodinium cohnii</italic>, that can be produced heterotrophically by fermentation. This technology is scalable but limited mainly by the capex required to produce very large biofermentor facilities [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-00089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. A potential limitation with 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Crypthecodinium</italic> ssp. is that they generally produce only DHA and not EPA and, therefore, most of the microalgal products are only sources of DHA (
