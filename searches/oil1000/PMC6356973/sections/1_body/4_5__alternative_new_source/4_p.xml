<p class="p">As oils, the GM oilseed products have, like Veramaris
 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup>, the advantage of being able to be used in feeds as direct oil replacements. Production is also easily scalable as the infrastructure for the cultivation, harvest, processing, distribution, marketing and utilisation of vegetable oils is highly organised and well-established [

Depending upon the process of oil extraction it is possible that added value may be obtained by the production of seed meals containing residual n-3 LC-PUFA, which could be a commercial advantage supporting their use in animal feeds, within the normal limits for canola/camelina meals based on their other nutritional (and antinutritional) properties [

The GM oilseeds also provide a variety of fatty acid compositions including an EPA-only oil or several oils containing both EPA and DHA, from one containing high levels of both EPA + DHA, to oils that are predominantly EPA or DHA with lower amounts of the other n-3 LC-PUFA [
