<p class="p">One of the most commonly used cereal food products used in the manipulation of dietary influences of food related illnesses is pasta, mainly as it is already a relatively low glycaemic index food product and hence regarded as a healthy carbohydrate-rich food product [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. When considering the factors which effect the glycaemic response of an individual, the total starch content of the food is of great importance as this is the material converted into reducing sugar components and in turn affects blood glucose levels. Hence the consumption of starchy foods (especially those which have a high level of starch which is considered readily digestible) has been related to diseases such as obesity and diabetes [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Generally, the recommendation is to consume foods which exhibit low glycaemic responses in order to avoid the risks associated with diabetes and cardiovascular or even neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Two of the ways to manipulate the rate and extent of starch digestion is by altering the protein and oil content of foods as these tend to lead to a reduction in reducing sugar release post ingestion [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This may be linked to the possibility of forming amylose-lipid complexes when starch and lipids are combined [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Previously researchers have studied the effects of different food lipids, including butter, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, and olive oil of different degree of saturation and chain lengths, on the glycaemic response of bread [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Lipids significantly decreased the starch hydrolysis rate, and the formation of amylose–lipid complexes and protein–lipid complexes may be responsible for this observation [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The presence of protein in the food matrix may influence starch digestion by the encapsulation of starch granules into the protein matrix of the food [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The effect of meat protein interactions on the digestibility of pasta has been studied [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The researchers observed that starch–protein interactions increased with increasing levels of meat additions and accounted for decreasing glycemic responses. Also, interaction between starch–protein–phenolic compounds in the food product affect protein structure through precipitation and decrease the starch and protein digestibility [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The supplementation of pasta with other functional ingredients has received much attention. For instance, pasta has been fortified with protein-rich ingredients such as faba bean flour [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], meat [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], shrimp powder [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], green mussel powder (Perna canaliculus) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], barely flour [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], amaranth seed flour [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Eruca vesicaria</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], artichoke canning by-products [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], almond flour [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], and 
 <italic class="italic">Nannochloropsis</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. However, the nutritional properties of pasta enriched with partial replacement of semolina wheat flour by salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus tschawytscha</italic>) powder (SFP) is still unknown. Therefore, the present investigation aimed to evaluate the effects of salmon powder as an ingredient for pasta production and its contribution to in vitro starch, protein digestibility, and antioxidant activity.
