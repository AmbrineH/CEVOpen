<p class="p">The amino acid profile of the digested pasta material was evaluated using an Agilent 1100 series (Agilent Technologies, Walbronn, Germany) high-performance liquid chromatography machine as described previously [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The machine used a 150 Ã— 4.6 mm, C18, 3u ACE-111-1546, column and the amino acids were applied at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Detection was at an excitation of 335 nm and emission of 440 nm for primary amino acids. At 22 min, the detector was switched to an excitation of 260 nm, emission 315 nm to detect secondary amino acid such as proline. The amino acid results are expressed in milligram amino acids/g protein of the pasta sample [
