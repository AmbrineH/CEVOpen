<p class="p">The multi-enzyme technique was used for the determination of in vitro protein digestibility of cooked pasta samples [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. An amount of 50 mL of protein suspension was prepared in distilled water (6.25 mg of protein/mL), adjusted to pH 8 with a solution of 0.1 N HCL and/or 0.1 N NaOH, and placed on magnetic heating stirring block at 37 °C. The multi-enzyme solution (1.6 mg/mL Trypsin, 3.1 mg/mL chymotrypsin, and 1.3 mg/mL peptidase) was maintained in an ice bath and adjusted to pH 8.0 with 0.1 N HCL and/or 0.1 N NaOH. An amount of 5 mL of the multi-enzyme solution was then added to the protein suspension, which was maintained at 37 °C. The decrease in pH was measured after the addition of an enzymatic solution at every minute for period of 10 min using a digital pH meter (S20 Seven EasyTM, Mettler Toledo, USA). The percent protein digestibility (Y) was calculated by using Equation (1):
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Y = 210.46 − 18.10x
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where x is the change in pH after 10 min.
