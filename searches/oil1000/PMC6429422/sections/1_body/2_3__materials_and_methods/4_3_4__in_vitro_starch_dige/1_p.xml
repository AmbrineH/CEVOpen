<p class="p">An in vitro digestion system as described previously [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] was used to evaluate the starch digestion properties of the pasta samples. The process used stomach digestion procedures utilising 0.8 mL 1 M HCL and 1 mL of 10% pepsin solution (Sigma Aldrich, Sydney, Australia) incubated at 37 °C for 30 min under constant stirring. The process also mimicked the digestion of the small intestine by the addition of 5 mL of 2.5% Pancreatin solution (Sigma Aldrich, Sydney, Australia) in 0.1 M sodium maleate buffer pH 6 at 37 °C for 120 min. Samples were analysed for reducing sugar content using the 3.5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS). Glucose release was calculated in mg glucose g/sample and plotted against time and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by dividing the graph into trapezoids.
