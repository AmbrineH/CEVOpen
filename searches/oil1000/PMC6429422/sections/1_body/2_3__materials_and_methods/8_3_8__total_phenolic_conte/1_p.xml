<p class="p">The total phenolic content of supernatant obtained from the in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion was measured using the Folin–Ciocalteu method as described by [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Freshly prepared 2.5 mL of 0.2 N Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and 7.5% Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was added to the digesta aliquots (0.5 mL) and incubated for 2 h in the dark. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 760 nm using the V-1200 model (Schimadzu, MD, USA). Gallic acid was used as a standard to determine total phenolic content of the samples as mg of Gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g sample
