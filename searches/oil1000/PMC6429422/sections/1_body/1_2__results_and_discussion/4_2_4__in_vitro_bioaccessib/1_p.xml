 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00839-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> illustrate the effects of digestion stages on the phenolic content of digesta and illustrate that the SFP pasta samples showed significantly increased bioaccessible phenolic compounds after gastric and pancreatic digestion compared to the control pasta samples. Analysis of the antioxidant activity of the phenolic compounds was conducted using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) mechanism. Results illustrate an increase in antioxidant activity by approximately 20% when SFP was incorporated into pasta (from 5.20 to 13.69 µmol Trolox g of pasta-1 (as observed during the gastric digestion stage) and 40.36 to 76.75 µmol Trolox g of pasta-1 (as observed during the pancreatic digestion stage). The total phenolic content of the control sample before and after digestion (1.49 mg of gallic acid/g of pasta and 0.82 mg of gallic acid g of pasta-1) and antioxidant activity (5.20 µmol Trolox g of pasta −1 and 40.36 µmol Trolox g of pasta-1) was lower than the SFP fortified pasta. This observation may be due to possible leaching of phenolic compounds during the cooking of pasta. Indeed, previous research has shown a similar result in cooked faba bean flour fortified pasta [
