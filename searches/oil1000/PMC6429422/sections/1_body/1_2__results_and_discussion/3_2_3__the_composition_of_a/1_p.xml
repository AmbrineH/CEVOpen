<p class="p">The quality of proteins may also be assessed by evaluating the composition of the breakdown compounds observed in the small intestine. Hence, combining both the amino acid composition and the protein digestion levels of foods can result in a clearer idea of the nutritional quality of pasta samples. The amino acid content of the SFP enriched pasta post in vitro digestion can be seen in

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to the control, and the enrichment of SFP into pasta resulted in a decrease in non-essential amino acids in the digesta (excepting arginine, alanine, and asparagine) compared to control pasta. Such results could be due to the proteinâ€“lipid interactions, as discussed previously, resulting in in the oxidation of amino acids, as has been noted by researchers previously [
