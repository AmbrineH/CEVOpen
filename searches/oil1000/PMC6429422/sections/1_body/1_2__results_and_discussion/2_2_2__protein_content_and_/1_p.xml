<p class="p">Researchers have used the in vitro protein digestibility value (IVPD) to determine the rate and extent of protein digestion in food materials [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The protein digestibility values of SFP enriched pasta samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00839-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and show that the addition of SFP to pasta samples increased the overall content of protein in the pasta samples. What was of interest was that the values for the uncooked and cooked pasta samples were similar and this indicated that the protein fraction in the pasta did not leach out during the cooking of pasta. However, despite the overall protein content being increased with SFP addition, the in vitro protein digestibility values of enriched pasta samples was lower when compared with the control pasta (reduced from 84.60 to 80.80%).
