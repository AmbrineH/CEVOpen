<p class="p">The reduction in digestibility could be due to fish protein structure, other components such as formation of a proteinâ€“starch complex, cross links between proteins [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Oxidized phenolic compounds have been proposed to react with proteins and form insoluble complexes, inhibiting the activity of proteolytic enzymes and interfering with utilization of proteins [
