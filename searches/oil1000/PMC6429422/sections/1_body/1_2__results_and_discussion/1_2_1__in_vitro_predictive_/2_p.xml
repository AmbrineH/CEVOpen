<p class="p">As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00839-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> the level of reducing sugars released over the 120 min in vitro digestion of the pasta samples varied between samples, however incorporation of SFP significantly reduced starch digestion and sugar release during the digestion of experimental pasta samples compared to durum wheat pasta samples (the control). Similarly, SFP fortified pasta samples exhibited lower levels of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) compared with the control samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00839-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Such results follows previous research on fortifying spaghetti with protein from bean flour [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], and may be related to the fact that lipids have been shown to form complexes with amylose and protein and in so doing they have been shown to disrupt the enzyme adsorption sites on the surface of starch granules [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], possibly due to incomplete gelatinisation of starch granules. In the present study, cooked pasta samples enriched with 5% SFP, 10% SFP, 15% SFP, and 20% SFP had 0.25%, 1.25%, 2.59%, and 3.69% lipid content, respectively. The reduction in digestibility may be attributed to the formation of amylose–lipid complexes (ALC) as has been demonstrated by other researchers investigating the effects of lipids on the enzymatic resistance of starch, and manipulation of starch granule swelling characteristics associated with starch gelatinisation [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. These studies, and others, have revealed that amylose–lipid interactions result in the formation of single helical structure with a conformational hindrance that restricts enzymes to hydrolyse the starch granule [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Additionally, it has been illustrated that the accessibility of starch degrading enzymes to the substrate can be hampered by the incorporation of proteins [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The results of this study confirm that protein (in the form of SFP) can be utilised to affect the starch–protein network and possibly regulate starch digestion by restricting the activity of α-amylase. It is possible that the addition of SFP encapsulates starch hence reducing the accessibility of starch degrading enzymes as mentioned by previous researchers [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. For instance, the addition of yam flour (

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] has been shown to disrupt the protein–starch matrix and restrict the access of starch degrading enzymes to starch granules. As can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00839-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> fortifying pasta with SFP reduced the standardised glycaemic AUC values when compared with the control sample. Similarly, when pasta flour was replaced with soya bean flour reductions were observed in the glycaemic values of the pasta [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Our work confirms that the incorporation of protein (SFP) into pasta can reduce the digestibility of starch and may be a novel option to the lowering of the glycaemic index of the carbohydrate rich food products.
