<p class="p">As mentioned before, starch and protein digestion (and the regulation of these chemical compositions) are of great importance to the nutritional benefit of foods such as pasta. Many studies have illustrated that the interactions between protein and fibre, or starch and fibre, even starch–protein–fibre, on the overall food structure confer effects on the rate and extent of carbohydrate and protein digestion [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00839" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For this reason, the research focused on using protein and oil from SFP, and incorporating SFP into pasta, to determine effects on protein, carbohydrate, and antioxidant activities following a standardised 120 min in vitro digestion.
