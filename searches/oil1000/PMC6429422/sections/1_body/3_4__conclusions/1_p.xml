<p class="p">This study illustrates that the fortification of durum wheat pasta with SFP can improve the nutritional quality of pasta. For instance, SFP addition led to an increase in the antioxidant levels and protein content of pasta whilst reducing the predicted glycaemic index of the food product. The study also illustrated that the antioxidant activity from supplemented pasta was bioaccessible in vitro and significantly increased with the supplementation of SFP.</p>
