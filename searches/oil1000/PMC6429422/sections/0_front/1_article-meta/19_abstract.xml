 <p class="p">This research focussed on the utilisation of salmon protein and lipid to manipulate pastaâ€™s glycaemic index and protein digestibility. Salmon fish (
  <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus tschawytscha</italic>) powder (SFP) supplemented pasta flour in amounts from 5% to 20% (
  <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
  <italic class="italic">w</italic>). Inclusion of SFP lead to a significant reduction in starch digestibility and hence the potential glycaemic values of pasta (experimental pasta being up to 143% lower than control values). SFP addition to pasta increased the release of phenolic compounds from pasta during both gastric digestion (179%) and pancreatic digestion (133%) in comparison to the control sample. At the same time, the antioxidant activity of the digested pasta was increased by up to 263% (gastric) and 190% (pancreatic) in comparison to durum wheat pasta alone. Interestingly, although protein levels increased with incorporation of SFP, the digestibility values of the protein decreased from 86.41% for the control pasta to 81.95% for 20% SFP pasta. This may indicate that there are interactions between phenols and protein in the pasta samples which affect overall protein digestibility levels.
