  <title class="title">Slip-peel tester output to show Static Peak force and Average force generated when removing a single louse eggshell.</title>
  <p class="p">Red lines show the start and stopping of the platen movement. Force output from the device is given in grams. The Static Peak force output (P) for initiating sliding of this egg was 348.1 mN and appears as a single peak. The average force (A) ranges between 16.3 mN and 81.7 mN and its relative lack of smoothness indicates some friction between the egg fixative tube and the hair.</p>
