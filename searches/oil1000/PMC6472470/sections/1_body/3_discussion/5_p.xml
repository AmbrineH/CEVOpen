<p class="p">Use of this type of product will of course vary from one country to another depending upon the perceived cultural and social impact and necessity of removing the eggshells after elimination of infestation. However, our experience of conducting clinical studies in the British community over a period of approximately 20 years has been that a growing proportion of families have become more conscious of persistent louse eggs and nits and increasingly want to remove them more efficiently. Having a treatment that makes egg and nit removal easier may have some small impact on levels of infestation overall but its main function will be empowering those families that have hitherto largely given up on attempts to remove louse eggshells for cosmetic reasons as being too great a challenge to manage. The result should be an improvement in self-esteem for those girls currently too embarrassed to style their hair, or in some cases too embarrassed to attend school, because they know that others are able to see the old eggshells stuck to the hairs.</p>
