<p class="p">Despite the fact that the majority of eggshells on a head are usually either hatched or non-viable, and therefore unlikely to result in continued infestation or reinfestation (

However, the problem with enforcing policies for removal of louse eggs, for example the “No Nit” policies operated by many North American school boards since the late 1980s, is that they can become draconian. These affect children, through unnecessary treatments and missing school, and parents through missing work and loss of earnings (

However, for many families in most countries the real problem with persisting eggshells is the fact that they are unsightly, revealing past infestations and suggesting that insufficient care has been taken in hair management. This also results in stigmatization and makes children, particularly girls, self-conscious and unwilling to style their hair in a way that could reveal the eggshells and nits.
