<p class="p">This is the first report of a product designed to remove the eggs of head lice that has demonstrated loosening of the grip of the fixative holding the eggshells to the hair shaft. Other studies have shown that some products can lubricate the hair to reduce or minimize snagging but in all cases the initial movement required some measure of force causing a tugging effect on the hair and scalp (

This study ignored preconceptions and took an empirical approach to the problem of identifying an egg loosening compound. Previous investigations showed that lubricants facilitated the sliding component of egg removal so this investigation centered on identifying one or more chemicals that could extend this effect into the initial loosening process. The discovery that pelargonic acid derivatives have an effect on the grip of the louse egg fixative was serendipitous. During the screening process several compounds in this group were shown to have some activity but isononyl isononanoate was identified as the most effective. In cosmetic products pelargonic acid derivatives are considered extremely safe and are used at concentrations from 0.03% to 64% (

Polymeric gelling agents formed by hydration were found to be compatible carriers of these lipid-like materials, improving the flow characteristics and increasing lubricity. Such emulgels are widely used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries (

The result was a gel that not only lubricated the sliding of the eggshells but more importantly was found to minimize the force required to initiate moving of the tube of eggshell fixative along the hair, something no previous formulation has achieved successfully.
