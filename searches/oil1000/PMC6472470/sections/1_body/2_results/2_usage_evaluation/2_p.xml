<p class="p">When the Hedrin Stubborn Egg Loosening Lotion was tested in human volunteers using the comb supplied in the commercial treatment kit, the numbers of eggs and nits combed from each of the participants on wetted hair alone and after treatment with the egg remover product are shown in 
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. In five cases, participants 003, 006, 008, 009, and 024, the number of recovered eggs and or nits was low because of irregularities in the alignment of comb teeth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>) that allowed some eggshells to pass between during combing. Each of these participants, apart from 003, was judged to have hair that is “Thick” (see 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), making it difficult to draw the combs through the hair because any inconsistencies in the alignment of the teeth snagged on the hair locks. It is possible that use of greater quantities of the egg removing product could minimize some of these problems but conducting the study using excess gel would have made observation and recovery of the eggshells more difficult.
