<p class="p">Eggs and or nits were removed from all participants from one or both sides of the head. Of the 15 participants, 14 (93.3%) had more eggs/nits or fixative fragments removed from the side of the head treated using the Stubborn Egg Remover. The one anomalous participant (015) had a large number of fragments of very old, brittle eggshells and nits that had undergone exposure to numerous treatments for infestation as well as other products applied to the hair. Consequently, the fixative material, which held these eggs and nits to the hair, was also very brittle and simply disintegrated when combed on the untreated side. Along with the broken eggs and nits a large number of fragments of the fixative also came away from the hairs and stuck to the comb. On the treated side, the egg removing gel made no apparent difference to the brittleness of the eggshells or the fixative. These also broke away from the hairs during combing but, because of the viscosity of the gel and irregular spacing of teeth on the comb, many fragments became trapped in the gel film so that most slipped through the spaces between the teeth of the comb and were lost in amongst the hairs.</p>
