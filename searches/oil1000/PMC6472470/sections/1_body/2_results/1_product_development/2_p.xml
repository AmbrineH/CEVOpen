<p class="p">Any product designed to facilitate louse egg removal should be applied to the hair and remain in contact for whatever time is required for the active principle to take effect. Because isononyl isononanoate (ININ) is oily in nature and water immiscible it is normally formulated with other compounds in order to make a cosmetically manageable preparation. A gel-like preparation was considered the most suitable. Initially a water soluble, PEG- modified silicone fluid, compatible with ININ, and designed for use in skin and hair products to provide a rinse off light conditioner was investigated. Although easy to wash off, in undiluted format the gel was sticky and relatively ineffective whether using a 50:50 or 75:25 mixture with ININ but when diluted to give a final mix of 60:15:25 egg removal improved (

It was found that a number of cosmetic products contain polymeric gelling agents that are designed to be used for creating water in oil or oil in water emulsions are water miscible and auto emulsifying. This range of products sold under the brand name Creagel® (CIT S.a.r.l., Dreux, France) incorporates a sodium acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer together with one or more of a hydrocarbon, ester, or fixed oil ready for auto emulsification with water. One product Creagel® EZ IN contains copolymer plus 10–30% ININ. Initial tests with only the emulsified polymer gave high peak force values, which suggested the ININ had a low bioavailability “locked” in the gel matrix, and this was not significantly improved even with inclusion of additional ININ. However, adding more water to the auto emulsified gel and then loading ININ to create a 20%–23% concentration in the final mixture was found to provide the best medium for delivery of the isononyl isononanoate and the mean Static Peak force was significantly reduced (
