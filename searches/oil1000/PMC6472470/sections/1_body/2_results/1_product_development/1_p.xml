<p class="p">Although initially conditioner-like materials, such as the medium-long chain alkanols hexadecane-1-ol or octadecan-1-ol, were considered possible facilitators of louse egg release, it was not possible to improve on the activity previously observed. Similarly, the supposed lubricant effects of siloxane (silicone) oils, such as found in head louse treatment products, did not alter the initial force required to start louse eggs moving along hairs confirming previous observations (

Some other “oily” materials were found to reduce the mean Peak Force measured over a batch of louse eggshells, particularly some alkyl esters and emollient surfactants, although there was considerable variation of effect between compounds and some showed more variance of the Peak Force within a batch of eggs than when removing eggs from dry hair, examples of which are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. In addition, on three occasions when evaluating the effect of isopropyl myristate and twice when testing octyl palmitate, the louse egg under test remained firmly fixed to the hair so that the hair broke and the Peak Force readings, which were off the scale, were not included in the data shown. From this screen it was observed that the most effective compound for reduction of Peak Force was a derivative of pelargonic (nonanoic) acid, isononyl isononanoate, which appeared to reduce the Peak Force most and most consistently when applied to eggs on dry hair and reduced the Peak Force significantly (

However, when the hair was pre-wetted, as would likely be the case when a caregiver chooses to remove nits from a child, it was less effective to reduce Peak Force and showed greater variance of effect (

We found incorporation of ININ into other oily materials considered to have lubricant properties; such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) dimeticones, the head louse treatment 4.0% dimeticone gel, which also contains a PEGylated dimeticone, or siloxane alternatives such as polyisobutene compounds; actually reduced the activity of the ININ even on dry hair. The only significant difference in terms of Peak force across this group of mixtures was between ININ on its own, applied to dry hair, and ININ mixed into 4% dimeticone gel (
