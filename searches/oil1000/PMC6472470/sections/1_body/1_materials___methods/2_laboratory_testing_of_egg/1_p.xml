<p class="p">We used a modified SP-2000 slip-peel tester (IMASS, Inc., Accord, MA, USA) to measure the force required to pull louse eggs or nits along treated hairs as previously described (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burgess, 2010</xref>). In early screening tests, each hair bearing a louse egg or nit was threaded through a glass 1 µL Microcap™ tube (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA, USA) that had been cemented to a glass microscope slide fixed to the platen of the slip-peel tester (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burgess, 2010</xref>). The end of the hair at the opposite end of the tube from the louse eggshell was held in a clamp attached to the force transducer and the platen set in motion. The hairs were aligned so that the proximal end of the eggshell, the part fixed to the hair by the glue-like material, was closest to the tube. As the base of the eggshell was brought into contact with the end of the Microcap™ tube, force was exerted to cause the glue fixative to release after which the eggshell was able to slide along the hair shaft. This method was used for the screening of technical substances and frame formulations to ensure that any changes induced by the applied chemicals in the forces required to initiate movement of the eggshells could be detected, relative to the same forces required to remove untreated eggs. Later tests of selected formulated materials followed the same principle except the hair shaft was fitted between the close-spaced teeth of a metal comb (Innomed™ Lice Comb, Hogil Pharmaceutical Corp., White Plains, NY, USA), which had been fixed across the platen of the slip-peel tester (

In some cases the treated eggshells, particularly the nits, could flex and slip between the teeth of the comb, unlike when the base of the egg was trapped against the end of the Microcap™ tube, and therefore gave a better representation of how any particular treatment formulation under test might perform if it were used with a comb to remove eggs from a head of hair.
