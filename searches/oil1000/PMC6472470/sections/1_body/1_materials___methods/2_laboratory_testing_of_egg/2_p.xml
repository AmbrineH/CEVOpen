<p class="p">Two forces were measured and recorded from the digital display of the slip-peel tester. The first, “Static Peak force” is generated as movement of the eggshell is initiated, i.e., it is the force required to release the grip of the tube of glue-like fixative that holds the eggshell in place on the hair (
