All comparisons of the effect of different chemicals, chemical mixtures, or formulated materials on peak force measurements ex vivo were therefore considered non-parametric. The relative effect of treatments to facilitate reduction of peak force was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test for multiple independent samples with post-hoc analysis by the Dunn method, adjusted by the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure of
