<p class="p">For the extensive primary screening process involving several hundred chemical substances, formulation components, mixtures, and commercial products, each candidate compound or mixture was tested for its effect on the Peak Force measurement using at least 10 louse eggs on hair for each replicate test. In each case the candidate material was compared with a suitable negative (damp or dry hair) and/or positive (a hypothetically lubricant preparation such as conditioner) control treated group of louse eggs. For the primary screening tests only intact louse eggs were used to ensure consistent rigidity of the eggshells under test. The search for a compound to facilitate louse egg removal had the obvious starting point of investigating the activity of known lubricants likely to facilitate sliding of the tube of glue-like fixative along the hair shaft after the initial release. We investigated various existing oily and surfactant-based cosmetic and toiletry products and head louse treatments, together with hair conditioning formulations and compounds. For unformulated chemicals, such as the oily and film-forming compounds, testing was conducted using undiluted material in the first instance, with subsequent dilutions in appropriate vehicles.</p>
