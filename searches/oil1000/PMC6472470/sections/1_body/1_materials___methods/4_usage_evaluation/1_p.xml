<p class="p">Using the previously validated method of measuring egg and nit removal from single hairs by means of the slip-peel tester, it was relatively straightforward to demonstrate the effectiveness of the final formulation in the laboratory. However, this could not confirm effectiveness when used on a human head where numerous hairs would be combed through at the same time and where differences in hair density, thickness of the hair shafts, and other physical characteristics would have an uncontrolled effect on the presentation of the louse eggshells and the fixative to both the egg removal formulation and the teeth of a comb. In order to demonstrate that the formulation could facilitate eggshell removal an untreated control was necessary. For this a half-head approach was selected on the principle that each participant would act as their own control, although it was recognized that there could be differences in the number and distribution of louse eggshells on one side of the head from the other. Participants in this study were recruited from prior contacts who had taken part in clinical studies and from respondents to radio advertising. For a study of a commercially available cosmetic or Class 1 medical device product, used for its intended purpose, there is no requirement or procedure in the United Kingdom to seek ethical approval through the National Research Ethics Service (see

However, the protocol employed was based on a protocol previously submitted by us to Huntingdon Local Research Ethics Committee (07/Q0104/44) for a similar procedure (
