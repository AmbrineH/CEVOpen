<p class="p">Prospective participants were provided with an information booklet describing the purpose and procedures of the study. Inclusion age was 4 years or over and, on an initial visual screening, to have at least 20 louse eggs and nits present. The age limit was set related to expected hair thickness characteristics rather than on safety grounds, because younger children often have relatively sparser hair. The only exclusions were: being pregnant or having a long term or irritant scalp condition, other than pediculosis. All participants satisfying the inclusion criteria either signed their own informed consent form, if over the age of 16 years, or it was signed on their behalf by a parent/guardian and countersigned by the visiting investigator, additionally children under 16 gave written assent.</p>
