<p class="p">After providing consent the participant washed their hair or it was washed by the parent/caregiver using a basic, non-conditioning shampoo, rinsed, and towel dried. Hair characteristics, e.g., thickness/fineness, dryness/greasiness, etc., were assessed prior to washing using a subjective assessment based on prior experience combing numerous children during previous head louse treatment studies and the texture/feel when combing with a grooming comb. All participants received the same treatment; although the side of the head treated using the egg removing product was determined using a computer generated randomization sequence. Allocation was blinded until each participant was randomized, the allocation being enclosed in a sealed, numbered instruction slip indicating which side should be treated.</p>
