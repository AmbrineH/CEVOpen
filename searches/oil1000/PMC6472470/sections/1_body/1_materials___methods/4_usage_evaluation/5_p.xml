<p class="p">The damp hair was parted along a center line and one half was then combed from scalp to tip using the comb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>) supplied as a package enclosure with the test product (Hedrin Stubborn Egg Remover Kit, Thornton &amp; Ross Ltd, Huddersfield, UK) and after each stroke of the comb any louse eggshells removed were transferred to a medical wipe tissue. The comb, which is a registered Class 1 medical device in the European Union, was drawn systematically through that section of hair to remove as many eggs as possible using 10 strokes of the comb following a sequence essentially similar to that used by 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallardo et al. (2013)</xref>, i.e., four strokes from front to back, three strokes from back to front, and three strokes from above the ear to the crown of the scalp. The hair on the other side of the head was then treated using the egg loosening lotion, which was thoroughly spread through the hair using a comb with wide spaced teeth and left

All louse eggs, nits, and glue fragments that were removed and extracted from the teeth of the comb were recovered to the case record and counted using a stereomicroscope.
