<p class="p">At the time of recruitment, potential participants were checked for the presence of live head lice. If low numbers of lice were present the person was not treated immediately so that the egg remover product could be evaluated without any possible interference from treatment product residues. In those cases the treatment was provided after completion of the egg remover test. Alternatively, especially where a large number of lice were present, the person was treated to eliminate infestation one week before the test of the egg remover, which allowed sufficient time for any residues of silicone to be washed from the hair.</p>
