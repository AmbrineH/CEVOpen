<p class="p">Insects of the order Phthiraptera all lay eggs that are fixed either to the hairs or the feather barbs of their hosts by means of a glue-like substance that is deposited and sets extremely rapidly as the egg is laid (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buxton, 1947</xref>). Studies of this fixative material indicate that it is constructed of linear polymerized proteinaceous molecules (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schmidt, 1939</xref>), forming Î² pleated sheets (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burkhart &amp; Burkhart, 2005</xref>). However, there is no evidence of a chemical bond with the hair, so that the firm positioning appears to be entirely due to a vice-like grip on the hair shaft initiated as the fixative polymerizes (

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burkhart et al., 1999</xref>). The hardened glue-like material is extremely resilient, not susceptible to biological or chemical breakdown (
