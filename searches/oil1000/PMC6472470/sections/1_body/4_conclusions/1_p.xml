<p class="p">Removal of head louse eggshells from hair is hampered by the grip of the egg fixative on the hair shafts. It has been shown previously that many products claiming to release the eggs and nits from hair do not work and there is a need for a preparation that facilitates eggshell removal. This study found a select group of compounds that loosened the grip of the fixative and, when formulated into an appropriate aqueous gel, could be shown in the laboratory to reduce the force required to initiate movement of the eggshells along a hair. It was also shown to enable easier removal of eggs and nits in a small usage evaluation in comparison with combing hair wetted only with water. In those territories where “nit removal” is considered an integral part of treatment such a treatment should make the process less stressful and easier for most households.</p>
