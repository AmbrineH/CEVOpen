<p id="Par39" class="p">The present study revealed that tested multidrug resistant strains isolated from clinical samples were resisted for the majority of currently available and affordable antibiotics in developing countries. The clinical isolates, those referred to as methicillin resistant 
 <italic class="italic">S.aureus</italic> (MRSA) were selected on the basis of their resistance to cefoxitin in a disk diffusion assay. This gram positive bacterium was resisted not only cefoxitin but also resisted for amikacin, amoxicine, ampicillin and cefotaxime (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). On the other hand, gram negative bacteria
 <italic class="italic">(E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic>) was unpredictably resisted for third generation cephalosporine and most commonly used penicillin classes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Such resistant strains had developed genes or gene products that enable them to resist for tested antibiotic. Unless and otherwise, new drugs or modify currently available antibiotic will be revolutionized, emerged multidrug resistant bacteria impose potentially large health and socioeconomic burden on societies and worries future provision of health care services.
