<p id="Par40" class="p">This study revealed that essential oils extracting from 
 <italic class="italic">B. cuspidata, B. ogadensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. schimper</italic> were demonstrated antibacterial effect against tested bacteria on their 10 μl/disc (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). They had appreciable antibacterial effect not only against reference strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>(ATCC25923), 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (ATCC25922) and 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC70603) but also on multidrug resistant strains isolated from clinical specimens. Their effectiveness varied with concentration, type of the essential oils and the type of bacteria species. Overall, all essential oils had overriding antibacterial effect against gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
