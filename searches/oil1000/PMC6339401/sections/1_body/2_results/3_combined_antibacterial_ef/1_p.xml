<p id="Par43" class="p">In our study, the combined essential oils were showed strong inhibitory action against all reference strains and multidrug resistant bacteria at 5 μl/disc (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Of which, the combined essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">B. cuspidata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. schimper</italic> (1:1 ratio) exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities. It had inhibition zone in diameter 39 mm, 38 mm, 35 mm, and 29 mm on MRSA, MSSA, 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> (R) and 
 <italic class="italic">E.coli</italic> (R) at 20 μl/disc respectively. This mixture had the lowest MIC and MBC values as compared to other mixture. The MIC values for 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> (R) and MRSA were (0.39 μl/ml) and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli (R)</italic> (1.56 μl/ml). Their MBC values were range from 0.78–3.12 μl/ml for multidrug resistant gram negative bacteria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). It had more antibacterial effect than modern antibiotics against selected reference and multidrug resistance bacteria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Though phytochemical study has not been done on 
 <italic class="italic">B. cuspidata</italic>, the presences of the antibacterial compounds presented in both essential oils were synergistic effect between them.
