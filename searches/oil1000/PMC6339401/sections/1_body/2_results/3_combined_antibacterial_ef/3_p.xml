 <italic class="italic">B.cuspidata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T.schimper</italic> had pronounced synergistic effect on MRSA and

 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Overall, 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> was most susceptible for combined essential oil. In contrary to this, the combined oil from

 <italic class="italic">T. schimper</italic> had antagonistic effect for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli (R),</italic> MRSA and
