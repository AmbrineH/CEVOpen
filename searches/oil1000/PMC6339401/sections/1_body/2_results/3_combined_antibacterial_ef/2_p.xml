<p id="Par44" class="p">The combination of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cuspidata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. ogadensis</italic> essential oil had 32 mm inhibition zone in diameter against both MSSA and MRSA (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). On the other hand, it showed an effective antibacterial effect on multidrug resistant 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli.</italic> It had MIC values ranges from 0.78–6.25 μl/ml for tested gram negative and 1.56 μl/ml against MRSA. It had MBC value 1.56 μl/ml for 
 <italic class="italic">K.pnemonae</italic> and MRSA and 25.0 μl/ml against multidrug resistant 
 <italic class="italic">E.coli.</italic> The combined effects of essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">B.ogadensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T.schimper</italic> had 21 mm and 17 mm inhibition zone in diameter at 20 μl/disc against 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> (R) and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (R) respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). It had also 19 mm inhibition zone in diameter on MSSA and MRSA. The combination of 
 <italic class="italic">T. schimper</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B.ogadensis</italic> had the highest MIC and MBC values for tested gram positive and gram negative bacteria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Overall, the combination of each essential oil had more potent antibacterial effect on MRSA and multidrug resistant 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> as compare to currently available and affordable antibiotics (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
