  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">An alarm increase the rate of emerging and re-emerging of multidrug resistant bacteria have been caused great public health concern in the worldwide. They have been resisting for most or majority of currently available and affordable antibiotics and imposed socioeconomic catastrophe at global scale. As a result, there is utmost important to discover new or modify currently available antibiotics. The aim of this study was to evaluate combined antibacterial effect of essential oils obtained from 
   <italic class="italic">Blepharis cuspidata, Boswellia ogadensis</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Thymus schimper</italic> against multidrug resistance (MDR) 
   <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Methicillin resistant S. aureus.</italic>

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">Essential oil (EO) was extracted from the aerial part of 
   <italic class="italic">B. cuspidata, B.ogadensis</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">T. schimper</italic> by steam distillation and stored in brown bottles at 4 °C. There were mixed in 1:1 ratio and adsorbed to disc and placed on MHA and measured their minimum inhibitory zone seeded with 
   <italic class="italic">E. coli, K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">MRAS</italic> after 18-24 H
   <italic class="italic">. minimum</italic> inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were measured by broth micro-dilution method. The interaction between EOs was determined by fractional inhibitory concentration index.

  <p id="Par3" class="p">The antibacterial potential of mixed oil depends on the doses and type of the EOs and bacteria species. The combined EOs of 
   <italic class="italic">B.cuspidata</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">T.schimperi</italic> had inhibition zone (39 mm), its MIC and MBC value was 0.39 μl/ml against MRSA. It had inhibition zone (28-35 mm), MIC value 0.39–6.25 μl/ml and MBC (0.78–12.5 μl/ml) against MDR 
   <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic>. Whereas, combined effects of 
   <italic class="italic">B. cuspidata</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">B. ogadensis</italic> had MIC values ranges from 0.78–6.25 μl/ml for 
   <italic class="italic">E.coli</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> and 1.56 μl/ml for MRSA. There was strong synergistic effect between the combination of 
   <italic class="italic">B.cuspidata</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">T.schimperi.</italic> This study revealed that gram negative bacteria were slightly less susceptible than gram positive.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">This in vitro study of combined EOs has significant antibacterial effect than using each of them and even it was more potent antibacterial effect on MDR as compare to modern antibiotics. Hence, it can be applied to a pharmaceutical composition as modulator or adjuvant or precursor for synthesis of new antibiotic in future activities
