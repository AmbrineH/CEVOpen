<p class="p">Media optimization can be divided into 3 stages, whereby the first stage assesses different carbon to nitrogen concentrations and ratios, the second and third stages compare the effect of different nitrogen and carbon sources on 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> growth and lipid production, respectively. Aside from variation in carbon and nitrogen sources and concentrations, all cultures were comprised of 1.5 g/L MgSO

Identical culture conditions were maintained during optimization at 28°C in a rotary incubator at 120 rpm for 5 days. Three biological replicates were prepared from varied conditions listed below.
