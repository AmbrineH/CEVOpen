<p class="p">A total of 12 carbon to nitrogen ratios were prepared in a combinatorial system based on 8, 16, 24, and 36 g/L carbon and 0.13, 0.26, and 0.67 g/L nitrogen, with glucose and yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Elemental carbon to nitrogen weight ratios were covered in this study in the range of 12: 1 to 240: 1. Based on supplier's information (Carl Roth, Germany), the complex media—yeast extract and tryptone/peptone—contain 11.8% (w/w) and 10% (w/w) nitrogen, respectively. Following RSM analysis, various nitrogen and carbon sources were investigated using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) strategy. The various nitrogen sources evaluated in this study encompass: ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, calcium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, 1:1 ammonium chloride and sodium nitrate, 1:1 yeast extract: tryptone/peptone, yeast extract, tryptone/peptone and urea. To investigate the effect of the nitrogen source on yeast growth, media was supplemented with 40 g/L glucose (16 g/L carbon) and nitrogen concentration of 0.13 g/L. The last stage of optimization covered 10 different carbon sources at an elemental carbon concentration of 16 g/L comprising 4 hexose monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, mannose, and fructose), a sugar alcohol (sorbitol), 2 pentose monosaccharides (xylose, arabinose), and 3 disaccharides (maltose, lactose, sucrose). For the screening of carbon sources, cultivation was carried out in media supplemented with the optimal nitrogen source as observed in the previous stage of optimization; 1.10 g/L yeast extract (0.13 g/L nitrogen).</p>
