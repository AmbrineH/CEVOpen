<p class="p">STATISTICA, version 7 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, USA) was adopted for design analysis of the first stage of media optimization. Analysis of Box-Behnken (response surface) design along with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to estimate the appropriate statistical parameters. This design was selected for analyzing the effect of selected nutritional variables, namely carbon and nitrogen levels, present in growth media on the dependent variables: Biomass (g/L), Lipid weight (g/L) and Lipid content % (g lipid weight/ g dry yeast cell weight). The levels examined for each of the independent factors are displayed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. This statistical design involves interactions amongst the selected variables and follows a linear/quadratic approach for screening of factors. After discovering the significant factors, each of the dependent factors was individually fitted using a second-order polynomial equation and a multiple regression of the data was carried out for obtaining an empirical model to represent the most significant factors. The general form of the second-order polynomial equation is shown below:
