<p class="p">Yeast growth was monitored daily by light scattering measurements at 600 nm. Dry Cell Weight (DCW) was quantified gravimetrically for 2 mL culture volume following harvesting, washing and lyophilization. Lipid extraction was conducted according to a modified procedure by Bligh and Dyer (

Shortly, 6 mL of Folch's reagent (2:1 chloroform: methanol) was added to washed yeast cells. An incubation of 2 h was sufficient to transfer the cells' lipid content to the chloroform layer. The aspirated chloroform layer was later dried under nitrogen stream overnight and the extracted lipids were weighed.
