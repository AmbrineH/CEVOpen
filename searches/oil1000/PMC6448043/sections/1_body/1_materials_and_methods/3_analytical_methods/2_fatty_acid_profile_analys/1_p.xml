<p class="p">Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were obtained by methanol transesterification of lyophilized yeast biomass. The transesterification protocol was originally adopted from Griffiths et al. (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). FAME profiles were analyzed on a GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph from Shimadzu (Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan) with flame ionization detector. One microliter sample was applied by AOC-20i auto injector (Shimadzu) onto a ZB-WAX column [30 m, 0.32 mm ID; 0.25 μm df; phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA)]. The initial column temperature was set at 150°C (maintained for 1 min). A temperature gradient was applied from 150° to 240°C (5°C.min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), followed by 6 min maintenance at 240°C. Fatty acids were identified according to retention times of the authentic standard: Marine Oil FAME Mix (Restek, USA). Individual FAME concentrations were based on peak areas relative to Methyl Non-adecaanoate C19 (Sigma, Germany), which was incorporated as an internal standard in all samples.
