 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> summarizes the test for significance and adequacy of each of the regression models listed above. The optimal values for the investigated dependent factors were predicted from the 3D response surface plot. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the effects of the independent variables and their combined effect on biomass (g/L), lipid weight (g/L), and Lipid content % (g lipid weight/ g yeast dry cell weight). Accordingly, the optimal predicted values for the dependent factors are 15.1 ± 0.60 g/L, 6.69 ± 0.22 g/L, and 44.36 ± 2.56% (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight), respectively. The determination confidence coefficient (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), which is conventionally applied to determine the model validity, implies that sample variation of 92.59, 95.64, and 90.23% for biomass, lipid weight, and lipid content, respectively, are attributed to the independent variables. Together with the significance of the Lack-of-fit test (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values of 0.0928, 0.1085, and 0.1436), we determined the integrity of the model designed for this analysis (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). As depicted in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the total growth increases with increasing carbon concentrations until a saturation level is obtained at 60 g/L glucose. Moreover, nitrogen limitation, which is essential for high lipid production, possess a strong negative influence on 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> growth. For this reason, lipid content (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight), as well as lipid weight (g/L), are equally scrutinized in this study. Furthermore, it is apparent from the three formulated regression equations that a combined effect of both independent factors significantly affects growth and lipid production. The second order polynomial equation was found to explain the optimal conditions by only considering the significant terms. Applying the RSM methodology allowed the role of carbon and nitrogen sources to be differentiated with respect to their importance and contribution to growth and lipogenesis potential. Those factors affecting Biomass are % C (linear and quadratic), % N (linear), and the linear interaction between % C and % N. In addition to those factors, the quadratic effect of % N highly influences lipid accumulation. Nitrogen-limitation has been previously assumed to be the strongest inducer of lipogenesis in 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> [26]. The response surface plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) clearly depicts the influence and sensitivity of the respective factors on growth and lipid production. The currently incomplete comprehension of the metabolic network and regulatory mechanisms driving the lipogenic processes in 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> might provide an explanation for our inability of attaining a higher determination coefficient [26]. Provided, that 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> performs similarly at elemental carbon to nitrogen ratios of 120: 1 and 180: 1, further optimizations were carried out at C: N of 120:1 at concentrations of 16 g/L carbon and 0.13 g/L nitrogen, to reduce optimization process cost. The validity of the designed Box-Behnken model is evident in reproducible measurements of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> growth and lipid yields [33]. This particularly holds true when the organism is cultivated (C: N 120: 1, 16 g/L carbon and 0.13 g/L nitrogen) with optimal nitrogen (see 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, yeast extract) and carbon (see 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, glucose) ratios. In addition to relative amounts of carbon and nitrogen, different elemental concentrations at same carbon to nitrogen ratios were examined. While runs 1(8 g/L carbon and 0.13 g/L nitrogen) and 5 (16 g/L carbon and 0.26 g/L nitrogen) maintain a carbon to nitrogen elemental weight ratio of 60: 1, their variation in carbon and nitrogen concentrations results in distinct biomass, lipid weight and lipid content. Similar observations were recorded for runs 4 and 11 at C: N of 120: 1.
