<p class="p">To assess the effect of carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the cultivation media on growth and lipid production of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>, the composition was subjected to Box-Behnken design-based DOE analysis. This analysis was performed using glucose as carbon source, since yeasts are reported to harbor efficient glucose import systems. Similarly, yeast extract was used as a complex nitrogen source as it contains all essential amino acids as well as other nutritional factors such as fatty acids, vitamins and trace element, which in combination improve biomass and lipid yield [30, 31]. It was previously reported that an elemental carbon to nitrogen ratio of 12: 1 does not deliver a nitrogen-limited environment for 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>, hence a range from 12: 1 to 240: 1 was analyzed in this study to cover the range between non-limiting and limiting cultivation conditions [32]. Initially, each concentration was carefully developed to fit one of three equally spaced values (âˆ’1, 0, and +1) to sufficiently generate a quadratic model. The model was later validated following an experimental set up of selected theoretical parameters. The Box-Behnken design matrix of the independent variables and their corresponding response on the dependent factors are displayed in
