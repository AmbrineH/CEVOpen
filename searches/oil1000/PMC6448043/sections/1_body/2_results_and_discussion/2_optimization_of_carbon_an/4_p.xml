<p class="p">Organic nitrogen was also supplemented to cultivation media in the form of urea. In this cultivation scenario, an intermediate growth between synthetic (ammonium salts and nitrates) and complex media (yeast extract and tryptone/peptone), resulting in an average biomass of 5.0 ± 0.1 g/L and similar lipid content as yeast grown in nitrate [36.8 ± 2.8% (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight)] was recorded. However, the final lipid weight collected after 120 h of cultivation was higher for 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> grown in urea compared to synthetic nitrogen sources due to enhanced growth. Initial isolation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> from Iowa State University Dairy Farm and its ability to metabolize urea triggered the annotation of its urate catabolic pathway (Bracharz et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017a</xref>). Such studies have shown that nitrogen limitation results in upregulation of urea transporter gene DUR3, urate oxidase gene URO1, putative ammonia transporter genes and most allantoin permeases to facilitate the import of remaining nitrogen sources (Kourist et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Whereas, glucose delivers 16 g/L of carbon concentration into cultivation media, urea merely delivers 0.055 g/L, indicating that the contribution of urea to the carbon concentration of the cultivation media is insignificant in comparison with glucose. In analogy, the contribution of yeast extract to the carbon concentration (0.44 g/L) of the cultivation is insignificant in comparison to the various sugars examined at 16 g/L, especially at the minute amount of yeast extract used to maintain nitrogen-limited conditions.
