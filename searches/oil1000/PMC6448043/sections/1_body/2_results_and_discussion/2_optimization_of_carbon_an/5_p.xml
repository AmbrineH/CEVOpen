<p class="p">Growth and lipogenic potentials of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> on variable carbon sources are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. In addition to its high lipogenic potential, the relatively high growth rates observed for this strain on a wide variety of sugar sources makes it highly desirable for industrial purposes, as fermentation costs can be reduced with the use of complex waste materials and hydrolysates. In contrast, the model oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic>, which has been target of extensive metabolic engineering efforts can only grow on few select carbon sources (glucose, mannose and glycerol) (Sitepu et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Shi and Zhao, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Assimilation of pentose sugars, mainly xylose, has been heavily investigated over the last 30 years for its abundance in lignocellulosic (30%) and hemicellulosic (90%) biomasses, which in turn are cost effective and highly abundant in nature (Tanimura et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Recent efforts enabling co-metabolism of hexose and pentose sugars by overcoming glucose repression in various oleaginous yeasts including 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodosporidium toruloides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodotorula glutinis</italic> has been reported (Yamada et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Adversely, few oleaginous yeasts including 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus, L. starkeyi</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Geotrichum fermentans</italic> exhibit the natural ability for sugar co-metabolism, which makes them directly applicable for growth on complex fermentation substrates (Tanimura et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Furthermore, semi-defined media can be selected more carefully with the aid of the results presented in this study. With respect to biomass yield and lipid formation, it can be concluded that 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> performs well on all tested carbon sources except the sugar alcohol, sorbitol. To this end, no record of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> efficient growth on sugar alcohols was evident in literature. Adaptation and remodeling of sugar transport system to accommodate for arabinose appears slower in 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> compared to other sugar transporters (Brauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). This is evident in the slow initial growth of this yeast on arabinose following pre-culturing on favorable sugar—glucose. In contrast, the galactose-glucose disaccharide lactose recorded highest cumulative growth and subsequently ranked amongst the highest with respect to lipid production efficiency (lipid content, g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight). Interestingly, lactose serves as a superior carbon source in 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> fermentations compared to either of its monomers galactose or glucose. As a result of the high growth rate of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> when cultured on lactose, two lactose hydrolases have been identified and thoroughly studied (West et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>). Given that 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> was originally isolated from dairy farm, it may be particularly adapted for efficient lactose metabolism (Bracharz et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017a</xref>). Conversion of whey permeate to lipids by this strain is industrially favorable given the high cell density and lipid yield achieved due to high lactose content (Bracharz et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017a</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>-based lipid production in pilot scale of 500 L bioreactors using lactose-rich deproteinised cheese whey has been reported in New Zealand since 1988 (Davies, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>). Interestingly, lipid content (49.7% g/g) achieved in this study during lactose fermentation is consistent with recently reported lipid content (49.6% g/g) recorded for 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> grown on lactose-rich deproteinised cheese whey and wine lees hydrolysate (Kopsahelis et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). However, fed-batch cultivation conditions employed by Kopsahelis et al. allowed for high lipid titers of 33.1 g/L, compared to 9 ± 0.34 g/L achieved in shake-flask fermentation in this study. Similarly, spent coffee hydrolysate offers another cost-efficient feedstock for 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>, due to its high mannose content (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>) (Scully et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Orrego et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). With respect to the assayed sugar monomers, galactose performs intermediately between glucose (C-4 epimer) and mannose (C-2 epimer). Sugar co-utilization studies have previously demonstrated a delayed uptake for galactose, which may be due to less efficient transport systems across the cell membrane compared to glucose (Meo et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The ketonic hexose, fructose, was shown to enhance the total growth of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> by a minimum of 1.9 g/L in comparison to other hexoses, nevertheless its lipogenic potential was not enhanced. Whereas, growth of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> on media containing fructose as sole carbon source was not previously reported, Tchakouteu et al. described initial abundance of intracellular total sugars (ITS) composed of glucose and fructose upon growth on sucrose followed by 66% drop concurrent with lipid production (Tchakouteu et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). At variance with either fructose or glucose, sucrose resulted in much lower biomass (10.3 ± 1.14 g/L) and lipid yields (2.79 ± 0.58 g/L; 27.52 ± 6.60% g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight). We further confirm reported work by Bracharz et al. that arabinose cannot be metabolized by 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> to generate biomass. However, most interestingly its aldopentose diastereomer, xylose, is a more favorable substrate for biomass generation than glucose under the evaluated growth conditions (Liang et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014a</xref>; Bracharz et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017a</xref>). In addition, maltose, a disaccharide of glucose, mimicked glucose in both biomass and lipid weight, indicating that 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> may harbor a very efficient extracellular maltose hydrolase activity or a very efficient maltose transporter in addition to an intracellular glycosidase shared with central metabolism, both of which have not been described to date.
