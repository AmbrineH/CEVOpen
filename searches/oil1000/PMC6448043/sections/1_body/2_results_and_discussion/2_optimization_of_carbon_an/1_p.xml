<p class="p">Conventionally, laboratory medium compositions applied in initial research activities differ substantially from the medium in which the final production strain is expected to perform on a technical scale (Hahn-Hagerdal et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Specifically, strain development is typically carried out in chemically-defined media to allow for strain-selection, easier metabolism definition, batch-to-batch variation exclusion and growth factor interference elimination (Zhang and Greasham, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Conversely, complex and semi-defined media favored in industrial settings allow for greater biomass and metabolite yields, while complying with economic constraints (Cocaign-Bousquet et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). Complex media are composed of undefined components and quantities, such as biogenic wastes and hydrolysates. The complex nitrogen sources examined in this study include yeast extract and tryptone/peptone and their mixture. The multiplicity of carbon and nitrogen sources of synthetic, organic, and complex media presented in this study stands as future reference for strain improvements throughout developmental and industrial stages. The significance of the nitrogen source on 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> growth and lipid formation is often neglected, placing more weight on carbon source performance (Swoboda, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1922</xref>; Evans and Ratledge, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1984</xref>; Godard et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Gutierrez et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Whereas, previous studies have focused on 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> ability for sugars co-utilization (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Gong et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Meo et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), this work is directed toward equal scrutiny and comparison of the effect of distinct carbon and nitrogen sources on 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> growth and lipid production. This comparison will aide in making an informed decision on the choice of genetic manipulations, that have to be implemented, to optimize sugar transport systems and streamline metabolic flux to enable efficient 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> growth and lipid formation. Similar strategies have been adopted for increasing lipid yield and expanding the substrate utilization of
