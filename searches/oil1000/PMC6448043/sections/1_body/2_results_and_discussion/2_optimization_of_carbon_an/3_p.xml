<p class="p">Our data indicates, that with respect to the lipid biosynthesis efficiency corrected for biomass yield, i.e., the lipid content % (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight) is quantitatively comparable over various cultivation conditions. Conversely, the lipid weight (g/L) is directly proportional and influenced by the growth rate. With respect to the former, the lipid content of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> grown in nitrates surpasses those grown in ammonium salts. In that regard, a difference of 7.9% (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight) in lipid content was found between 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> cultivated in media supplemented with ammonium phosphate compared to equivalent cultivations with ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride, elevated for the former. Additionally, no altered lipid formation response was detected in cultivation media containing different ammonium salts or different nitrates. Notably, coupling of ammonium salts with nitrate by supplementing media with ammonium nitrate or 1:1 ammonium chloride: sodium nitrate resulted in a similar lipid content as yeast grown in ammonium salts alone. This data is an indication that 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> may be sensitive to ammonium toxicity.
