<p class="p">Commonly, media supplemented with complex (undefined/multiple) nitrogen sources result in high biomass accumulation due to ample availability of readily metabolizable amino acids, polypeptides, nucleotides, and various vitamins and trace elements (such as Mg, Ca, K, and Fe). This is apparent in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> with total biomass of 13.10 ± 0.27 g/L for yeast extract: tryptone/peptone, 13.29 ± 0.15 g/L for yeast extract and 11.18 ± 0.18 g/L for tryptone/peptone, after 120 h of cultivation. In contrast, low yeast biomass accumulation in media supplemented with synthetic/ inorganic nitrogen is attributed primarily to additional energy requirement for amino acid synthesis aside from energy requirement for self-propagation and growth. This is evident in media containing ammonium salts resulting in severely reduced growth compared to media containing complex nitrogen sources, followed by nitrates, with an average biomass of 2.1 ± 0.3 g/L. Additionally, ammonium uptake and growth is largely deterred by the acidification of the media in which excess protons, generated from amino acid biosynthetic pathway, are transported out of the cell to stabilize internal pH (Casey et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>; Casey and Ingledew, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1986</xref>). Nonetheless, minimal potassium requirements for optimal yeast growth must be 100-fold higher than environmental concentrations (abundance of amino acids) when ammonium is used as the nitrogen source (Rodriguez-Navarro and Ramos, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1984</xref>; Hess et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). When synthetic nitrogen sources were utilized in this study, potassium levels were not adjusted accordingly, which could explain lower biomass measurements. Moreover, the target of rapamycin complex (TORC) associated signaling cascade is a key player in nutrient-starvation, which in oleaginous yeasts is linked to lipid accumulation and cell proliferation. In the model yeast 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic>, TORC is also linked to ammonium toxicity and chronological life span (CLS) shortening in absence of amino acids (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Bracharz et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017b</xref>). This correlation is yet to be established in oleaginous yeasts.
