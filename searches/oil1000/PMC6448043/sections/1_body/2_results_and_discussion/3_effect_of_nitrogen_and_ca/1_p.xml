<p class="p">Industrial application of Single Cell Oils (SCO) is dependent on the fatty acid profile of the yeast in question, which in turn is influenced by cultivation conditions (Ochsenreither et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Regardless of growth regime, the principal chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> TAG mimics plant-derived lipids such as palm oil, with oleic acid [C18:1, 43–57% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)] as main component succeeded by palmitic acid [C16:0, 16–33% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)] (Hassan et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994a</xref>). Increased concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, as detected in 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodosporidium azoricum</italic>, are essentially required to improve the cold-flowing properties of biodiesel (FAMEs). However, they are undesirable for Green-diesel production due to elevated hydrogen consumption. The maximal potential of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> is thus achieved in Green-diesel (HVO) processes, as it meets advanced feedstock specifications required by hydrotreatment process (Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil—HVO) due to its low degree of unsaturation (Capusoni et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). To achieve this level of saturation for medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), a recent study combines molecular design and TALENs in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> for the development of sustainable aviation fuels (Rigouin et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The main influence exerted by media composition is most apparent in saturation degree perceived in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figures 3A,B</xref>. This is evident when ammonia is supplemented in the media, with a shift in the FA spectrum from palmitic acid [C16:0, 13% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)] and stearic acid [C18:0, 4% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)] toward linoleic acid [C18:2,15% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)], in addition to assumed elongation with emergence of 1.8% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight) lignoceric acid C24:0. The fatty acid profile of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> appears to be more susceptible to carbon source than nitrogen source, as visualized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>. Whereas mannose, maltose, and lactose attain identical fatty acid profile as glucose, sorbitol and arabinose show maximal diversion. The latter show reduction in stearic [C18:0, 2–6% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)] and oleic acid [C18:1, 6–8% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)] in favor of linoleic acid [C18:2, 8% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)] in comparison with glucose. Additionally, arabinose along with xylose and sucrose, show a slight decrease in oleic acid C18:1 in favor of palmitic acid [C16:0, 3% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight)]. When galactose is used as a carbon source, the result involves a decrease in palmitic acid (C16:0) consistent with parallel increase in stearic acid (C18:0) and recording highest fraction of oleic acid (C18:1) at 57% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight). The differentiation among carbon and nitrogen sources is more prominent with the fatty acid profiles. Specific fatty acid profiles associated with desired product application can be obtained with careful selection of media components.
