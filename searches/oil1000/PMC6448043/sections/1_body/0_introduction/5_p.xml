<p class="p">To that end, conventional medium optimization studies are conducted following the classical one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method where, at a given time, only one factor is varied while all other variables remain constant. This strategy includes iterative removal, supplementation and replacement experiments of the various chemical and physical components of the medium, resulting in laborious protracted experiments (Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). By contrast, design of experiment (DOE) guided studies, applied in this work, allow an accurate statistically validated, multi-factorial medium optimization strategy. This methodology reduces experimental time and labor compared to the OFAT method and generates statistically verified data. One approach to DOE is Response Surface Methodology (RSM), developed by Box and Wilson (Box and Wilson, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1951</xref>). RSM is a mathematical modeling algorithm that uses factorial designs to assess the correlation between the response and different variables either alone or in combination, eventually allowing the optimization of the production processes (Singh et al.,
