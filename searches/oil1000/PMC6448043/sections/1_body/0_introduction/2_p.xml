<p class="p">To that end, oleaginous yeasts offers a potentially sustainable alternative to meet the demand for bio-based energy and platform chemicals as they can fermentatively convert a broad spectrum of waste biomass substrates into triglycerides. Moreover, these organisms, can be cultivated in existing bioreactor systems without impacting agricultural activities (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Specifically, yeasts that intracellularly accumulate neutral lipids in excess of 20% w/cell dry weight when cultivated under nutrient (N, P limitation) restriction, are termed “oleaginous yeasts” (Ratledge and Wynn, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Beopoulos et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The majority of the generated triacylglycerols (TAGs) display a fatty acid profile similar to that of plant oils (Papanikolaou et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Moreover, oleaginous yeasts, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus</italic> (ATCC 20509) have a pronounced ability to utilize diverse carbon sources—such as glucose, galactose, xylose, n-acetylglucosamine, volatile fatty acids, cellobiose, sucrose, lactose, glycerol, and complex biomass waste materials as feedstock (Evans and Ratledge, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Gujjari et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Chi et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Liang et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014b</xref>; Willis et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Rakicka et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). As this organism has the metabolic capacity to accumulate in excess of 50% w/cell dry weight as lipids when nutrient restriction is applied, it is in focus for industrial developments of sustainable oleochemical and biofuel production. Most interestingly, the fatty acid composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> is similar to that of plant-oils with C16 and C18 being the principal fatty acids (FAs) at 16–33 and 43–57% (g FAME/g dry yeast cell weight), respectively (Hassan et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994a</xref>; Ageitos et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In fact, B20 Biodiesel derived from 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> microbial-oil meets the ASTM (D6751) certification (Wahlen et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Willis et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Being a suitable building block for biodiesel production, this microbial oil produced by oleaginous yeasts such as 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> offers a sustainable alternative for plant-derived oil without competing with agricultural activities. Nonetheless, production cost of yeast SCO remains higher than that of 1st generation biofuel. While the former is estimated to 3 $.kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, excluding feedstock cost, the latter ranges between 1.2 and 1.9 $.kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for conventional vegetable oils such as rapeseed, soybean, and sunflower oil (Papanikolaou and Aggelis, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Techno-economic evaluation of SCO processes has demonstrated that the main cost generators are associated with the fermenters required to maintain fed-batch conditions (Koutinas et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Karlsson et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
