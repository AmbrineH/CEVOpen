<p class="p">The aim of this study is to use RSM as a computational guidance tool to simultaneously modulate and optimize multiple medium factors, in particular carbon and nitrogen, to ultimately improve biomass and lipid production of the oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>. Initially, the response surface methodology, applying a Box-Behnken Design, is employed to evaluate the effect of nitrogen and carbon levels. Specifically, RSM assess the relative contribution of carbon and nitrogen sources on the 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> growth and lipid production. Subsequently, 12 distinct nitrogen sources and 10 selected carbon sources, encompassing the most comprehensive media components involving complex, synthetic/inorganic and organic media composition for 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>, are investigated (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This statistically verified, multi-factorial data interrogation provides insight into the physiology of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> (growth, lipid production and fatty acid profile) toward development of an industrial cultivation process.
