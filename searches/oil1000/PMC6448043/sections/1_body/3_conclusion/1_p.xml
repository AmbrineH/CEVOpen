<p class="p">Response Surface Methodology (Box-Behnken) allowed concurrent optimization of carbon and nitrogen concentrations and elemental ratios in cultivation media of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>, achieving a lipid yield of 0.42 ± 0.01 g lipid/g carbon, with 120:1 (16 g/L carbon and 0.13 g/L nitrogen). In our experimental setup, the highest biomass (18.4 ± 2.20 g/L) and lipid yield [9 ± 0.34 g/L; 49.74 ± 5.16% (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight)] were obtained when lactose and yeast extract were used as carbon and nitrogen sources at an elemental weight ratio of 120:1, respectively. Conversely, the lowest biomass (1.93 ± 0.08 g/L) and lipid yield [0.32 ± 0.03 g/L, 16.35 ± 1.78% (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight)] were obtained for glucose and ammonium chloride as carbon and nitrogen sources at an elemental weight ratio if 120:1, respectively. The physiological implications of these results are explained by the adaptive characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> to uptake and metabolize lactose and amino acids efficiently, in contrast to inorganic nitrogen entities. Furthermore, complex organic nitrogen sources such as yeast extract contain ample vitamins and trace minerals required for growth. Notably, the lowest lipid content [13.48 ± 1.90% (g lipid weight/g dry yeast cell weight)] was obtained with a C: N of 24:1 using glucose and yeast extract as a carbon and nitrogen sources, indicating that nutritional starvation was not reached. That the lowest biomass and lipid yields were obtained with ammonium chloride due to toxicity effects exerted by ammonium upon 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> metabolism (see section Optimization of Carbon and Nitrogen Concentrations). These observations, in conjunction with the repertoire of this yeast's behavior in various carbon and nitrogen sources tested here, present a valuable source for identifying adequate and cost-efficient growth media (hydrolysates and waste materials). Comparison of fatty acid profiles of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>, when grown on different carbon and nitrogen sources, revealed enhanced saturation concerted with inorganic nitrogen sources, sorbitol and arabinose as carbon sources. Furthermore, it is pivotal to develop appropriate techniques for genetic manipulation to further improve the lipogenic potential and broaden the industrial application of 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic>. Future studies aimed at understanding 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> lipogenesis in 
 <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> from proteomic perspective will depend on optimal culture conditions developed in this study.
