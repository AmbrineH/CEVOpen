 <p class="p">The non-conventional, oleaginous yeast 
  <italic class="italic">Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus</italic> is flagged as an industrial cell factory for generation of oleochemicals and biofuels due to its substrate flexibility and high triglyceride yields. In this study, we employed a computational Response Surface Methodology to guide and streamline the experimental media optimization matrix with 12 nitrogen and 10 carbon sources in order to provide for high biomass and lipid accumulation toward an industrially relevant fermentation process. The resulting data provide new insights into 
  <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> physiology under variable nutritional states. Accordingly, the lipid content % (lipid weight/yeast dry weight) is controlled by a defined interplay between carbon and nitrogen. In our experimental setup, the highest biomass (18.4 ± 2.20 g/L) and lipid yield (9 ± 0.34 g/L; 49.74 ± 5.16% g lipid weight/g yeast dry cell weight) were obtained with lactose and yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources at an elemental weight ratio of 120:1, respectively. Interestingly, with ammonium salts as a N-source, the intracellularly accumulated triglycerides increasingly contain saturated fatty acids, which provides a new route to generate tailored fatty acid profiles for specific oleochemicals or food applications. Our data indicate that a metabolic ceiling for lipid accumulation in 
  <italic class="italic">C. oleaginosus</italic> is obtained with the correct carbon and nitrogen source mixture.
