 <p> Essential oil concentration in sweet basil shoots 5 weeks after inoculation with the AM fungus R. irregularis, with S. indica and with both fungi under different heavy metal treatments. (A) Linalool concentration, (B) Eugenol concentration, (C) Eucalyptol concentration, (D) Methyl chavicol concentration. Bars are patterned as described for Figure 2 and represent the mean out of three plants with standard error. Letters indicate a significant difference at p ≤ 0.05 according to Tukey’s HSD test where all factors do interact. Asterisks indicate a significant difference compared to the respective non-inoculated control at the different heavy metal treatments according to Tukey’s HSD test (see Supplementary Tables S6, S7), ∗ p ≤ 0.05. </p>
