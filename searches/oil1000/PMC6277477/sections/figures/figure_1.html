 <p> Colonization of sweet basil roots with Rhizophagus irregularis and Serendipita indica after 5 weeks of inoculation. (A) Histological section of a mycorrhizal sweet basil root stained with acridine red, acriflavine and astra blue. The arrow indicates cells with arbuscules. Scale bar: 20 μm. (B) Mycorrhizal colonization in %. Gray bars indicate sweet basil plants only inoculated with the AM fungus R. irregularis while black bars indicate plants inoculated with both, R. irregularis and S. indica. Data show means of three individual plants and ten 1 cm root segments per plant with standard error. Bars topped by the same letter do not differ significantly at p ≤ 0.05 according to Tukey’s HSD test (see Supplementary Table S1), where all factors do interact, calculating heavy metal treatment as one factor. (C) Qualitative detection of S. indica in sweet basil roots with PCR, using the ITS gene of S. indica. Representative samples are shown, which are either inoculated with R. irregularis or S. indica. </p>
