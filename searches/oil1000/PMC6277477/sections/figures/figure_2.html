 <p> (A) Representative sweet basil plants inoculated with different fungi growing in uncontaminated soil. (B) Sweet basil shoot and (C) root dry weight after 5 weeks inoculation with the AM fungus R. irregularis, with S. indica, and with both fungi under different heavy metal treatments. Gray bars indicate non-inoculated sweet basil plants (control), black bars indicate plants inoculated only with S. indica, dashed gray bars indicate plants inoculated only with R. irregularis, and dashed black bars indicate plants inoculated with both fungi. Bars represent the mean out of nine individual plants with standard error. Asterisks indicate a significant difference compared to the respective non-inoculated control at the different heavy metal treatment according to Tukey’s HSD test (see Supplementary Table S2), ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ p ≤ 0.001. </p>
