 <p> Lead (Pb) and copper (Cu) concentration in sweet basil roots and shoots 5 weeks after inoculation with the AM fungus R. irregularis, with S. indica and with both fungi under different heavy metal treatments. (A) Pb concentration in shoots and roots which grow on soil contaminated with Pb and both heavy metals, respectively. (B) Cu concentration in shoots and roots which grow on soil contaminated with Cu and both heavy metals, respectively. Bars are patterned as described for Figure 2 and represent the mean out of three plants with standard error. Asterisks indicate a significant difference compared to the respective non-inoculated control at the different heavy metal treatments according to Tukey’s HSD test (see Supplementary Tables S4, S5), ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ p ≤ 0.001. </p>
