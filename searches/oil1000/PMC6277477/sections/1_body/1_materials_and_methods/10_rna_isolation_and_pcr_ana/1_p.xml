<p class="p">Fresh root material was transferred directly into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for the detection of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> activity by RT-PCR. Frozen material (100 mg) was ground with a tissue homogenizer (Precellys 24, VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) at -12°C. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy plant Mini Kit from Qiagen (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions, including the on-column-DNAse treatment for 30 min. The quality and quantity of the RNA was monitored with the NanoDrop 2000 (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). 500 ng of RNA was transcribed to cDNA in a final volume of 10 μl with the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit from Qiagen (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Synthesized cDNA was used as a template for PCR to detect
