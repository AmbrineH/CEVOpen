 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O placed outside the sample vessel) at 200°C for 15 min in a microwave (μPREP-A microwave system, MLS GmbH, Leutkirch, Germany). The digested solution was diluted to 50 mL with deionized water. To an aliquot of 5 mL of the sample solution, 10 mL of vanadate–molybdate reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was added. After 5 min incubation, P concentration was determined at 440 nm using a V-550 spectrophotometer (Jasco GmbH, Grossumstadt, Germany). Results were calculated in mg P × g
