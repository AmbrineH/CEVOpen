<p class="p">The plants were harvested 5 weeks after transplanting and inoculating. This time period was chosen to keep the plants from flowering. Shoots and roots were separated and the plant height (cm), the shoot fresh weight (g/plant), and the number of leaves were measured. Aliquots of 300 mg root material were stored in 70% ethanol to evaluate the mycorrhization through microscopy and histology, and 100 mg of root material was frozen in liquid nitrogen to assess 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> colonization with PCR. Shoots and roots dry weights were determined after drying in an oven at 65Â°C for 3 days. Samples were ground in a high speed rotor mill (Pulverisette 14, Fritsch, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) to measure lead, copper and oil content in shoots and roots and the phosphorus content in the shoots. Since oil values were compared to each other without the need of the absolute values, a potential loss of volatiles during the drying process was acceptable.
