<p class="p">The extracted sample was analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to confirm peak identities and quantified with GC using flame ionization detection (FID). GC analysis was carried out with a Zebron ZB-5 capillary column (Phenomenex, 5% phenyl-95% dimethylpolysiloxane film, 30 m long × 0.25 mm id, 0.25 μm film thickness). Split less injection of 1 μl sample was performed using an injector temperature of 220°C. The instrument was programmed with an initial temperature of 40°C for 3 min, which was increased at a rate of 2°C/min up to 80°C. The temperature was then increased at a rate of 5°C/min to 160°C, following by a rate of 60°C/min up to 300°C. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas at a constant flow of 2 mL/min. The MS scan was set at 50 to 350 m/z, starting after a 5 min solvent delay. Ionization was done through an electron impact at the standard 70 eV. The mass selective detector transfer line heater was at 230°C, the quadrupole of the MS at 150°C and the MS source at 230°C. Compounds were identified by the comparison of their GC retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. To quantify the compounds, a five point calibration was obtained with the authentic standard (
