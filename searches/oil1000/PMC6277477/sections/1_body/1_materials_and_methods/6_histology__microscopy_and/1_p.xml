<p class="p">Root samples were cut into small pieces of (1–2 cm), bleached in 10% KOH for 15 min at 90°C, washed with water, and submerged in 2N HCl for 2 min. Then they were stained with Trypan blue (0.05%) in lactoglycerol for 15 min at 90°C in a water bath and bleached in lactic acid according to 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Koske and Gemma (1989)</xref>. Ten pieces were put on slides and observed under a light microscope with 200 times magnification. AM fungal structures (hyphae, arbuscular, and vesicles) were estimated quantitatively according to 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Biermann and Linderman (1981)</xref>. For the histological sections, roots, dehydrated by increasing the ethanol concentrations from 70 to 99% and embedded in paraffin, were cut into 6–12 μm sections using a Leica RM2155 microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and placed on a microscope slide. Furthermore, the staining method W-3A described by 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wacker (2006)</xref> was used. The samples were stained with 1% acridine red for 5–15 min and washed 15 min with distilled water to stain the cell walls blue. The second staining was done with 1% acriflavine for 5–15 s and washed with distilled water for 5 s to stain the fungal hyphae yellow. The last staining was done with 2% astra blue for 30–180 s and then washed off completely for 10–20 s with distilled water to stain other parts of the cell wall red. For the staining solutions see:

The samples were examined with an Olympus BX53 light microscope (Olympus, Tokio, Japan).
