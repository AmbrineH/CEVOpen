<p class="p">With the program package Statistica (version 12, Tulsa, OK, United States) an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) was performed at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05 to detect significant interactions between factors while taking into account the fact that multiple comparisons are necessary due to the experimental design. Lead and copper treatment was considered as single factor (except for Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>), respectively and each 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> inoculation was also considered as a single factor, respectively. For detailed information see Supplementary Tables 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9" class="xref">S9</xref>. If no significant interaction between all factors was observed, the mean values were compared pairwise at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05 with Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-Test. All data are shown as mean values with standard errors.
