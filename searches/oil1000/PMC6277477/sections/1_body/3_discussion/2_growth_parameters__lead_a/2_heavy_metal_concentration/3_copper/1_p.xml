<p class="p">Given our setup, the copper concentration in the sweet basil shoots decreased significantly when the roots are inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> but not when they are mycorrhizal. The exact mechanisms responsible for this difference are unknown at present. One explanation could be that some fungi are able to use avoidance mechanisms or compartmentalization strategies to detoxify metal cations (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meharg, 2003</xref>). The mycelia architecture of 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> alters considerably under copper concentrations, at amounts lethal to other organisms (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ruscitti et al., 2017</xref>). Although 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tamayo et al. (2014)</xref> revealed the presence of 30 metal transporters for copper, iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic>, the exact function and purpose of these transporters in the 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> membranes are unknown. Our results indicate that a comparison between the copper transporters in 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> might be helpful to explain the different effects of the two fungi on copper uptake by sweet basil.
