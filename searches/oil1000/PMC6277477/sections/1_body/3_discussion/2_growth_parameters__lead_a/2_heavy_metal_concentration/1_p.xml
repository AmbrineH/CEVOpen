<p class="p">AMF colonizing plant roots were shown to reduce the uptake of heavy metals into plant cells (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hildebrandt et al., 2007</xref>). This can take place by changing the soil structure and chemical stabilization of metals in the soil (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dietterich et al. (2017)</xref> found no effects of AMF colonization on plant metal uptake, whereas a promotion of heavy metal uptake with AMF and

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Park et al. (2016)</xref> showed that peat moss supports mobility and bioavailability of lead and copper. This indicates that the effect of AMF to heavy metal toxicity in plants is highly dependent on the plant host species, the fungal isolate and the soil structure.
