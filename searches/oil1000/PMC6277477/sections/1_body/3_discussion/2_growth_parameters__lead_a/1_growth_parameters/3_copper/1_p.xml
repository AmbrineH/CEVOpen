 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> was not able to significantly improve growth of the shoots of sweet basil when copper was present in the soil. For barley, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Karimi et al. (2011)</xref> showed that the growth promoting effect was dependent on copper levels in the soil. Sweet basil inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> and grown in copper contaminated soil still showed a significant growth promotion on the shoots and the roots in our experiment (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). Plant biomass, root density, chlorophyll, carotenoid, and protein content significantly increased in 
 <italic class="italic">Glycine max.</italic> with the inoculation of 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium funiculosum</italic> LHL06 to counteract copper stress by secreting bioactive gibberellins to bind the metal into stable complexes (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Khan and Lee, 2013</xref>). In contrast it is known that gibberellins have a negative effect on arbuscule formation in pea and tomato (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foo et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Martín-Rodríguez et al., 2016</xref>). Copper has no influence on sweet basil shoot dry weight in the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>. In contrast to AM fungi, 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> colonizes plant roots mainly extracellularly. We therefore hypothesize that copper, which can act as a fungicide, harms the fungus and thus limits its growth promoting effects to the shoot. This still needs to be verified by, for example, determining the colonization level of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> under different heavy metal stresses.
