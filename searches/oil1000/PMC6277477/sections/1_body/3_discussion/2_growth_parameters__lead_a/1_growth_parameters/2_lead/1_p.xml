<p class="p">Even though both fungi improve growth in shoots and roots when the soil is contaminated with lead, the increase in growth is lower for 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> treated plants compared to plants treated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> (Figure

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al. (2016)</xref> also discovered a decreased growth promotion with different lead concentrations on mycorrhizal 
 <italic class="italic">Robinia pseudoacacia</italic>. Interestingly, in our experiment, lead had no influence on the growth promoting effect of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>. This is in agreement with observations that barley plants inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> are more resistant to lead than the non-colonized controls (

 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> might be more suited for plant benefits than AM fungi when the soil is contaminated with lead.
