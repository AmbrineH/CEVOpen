<p class="p">It has been proposed that AM fungi suppress salicylic acid (SA) signaling during later stages of colonization allowing a biotrophic interaction (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the early biotrophic stage of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> colonization is followed by a programmed cell death-associated later stage (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lahrmann and Zuccaro, 2012</xref>). This later stage might be accompanied by SA accumulation, and SA-regulated genes are induced by 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> under drought stress (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zhang et al., 2018a</xref>). This difference during late stages of colonization might explain the better performance of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>-inoculated plants under lead stress, since an alleviative effect of SA has been shown when wheat seedlings were treated with 200 mg/L lead (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Song et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> might be able to recruit jasmonic acid signaling to counterbalance the salicylic acid defense pathway in Arabidopsis (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jacobs et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore it might be interesting to measure the activity of oxidative stress enzymes if they are altered like 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Song et al. (2012)</xref> did for wheat. Both fungi are important players when plants deal with oxidative stress (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nath et al., 2016</xref>), but if and how this happens in our experimental setup needs further investigations.
