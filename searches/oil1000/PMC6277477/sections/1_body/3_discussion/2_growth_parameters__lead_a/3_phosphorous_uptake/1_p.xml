<p class="p">We showed that the mycorrhization effect on sweet basil roots was impaired by lead and not by copper (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). The ability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> to support plant nutrition is still under investigation. 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ngwene et al. (2016)</xref> found that 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> is able to solubilize phosphate from inorganic phosphorus by lowering the pH, rather than an enzymatic effect. Our results show that 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> impairs the mycorrhizal effect in the uncontaminated soil, which is in contradiction to our finding that plants inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> had a higher mycorrhizal colonization. Therefore this increase in mycorrhizal colonization may not have a biological relevance.
