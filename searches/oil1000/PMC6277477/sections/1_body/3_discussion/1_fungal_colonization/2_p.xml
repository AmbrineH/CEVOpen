(2011)</xref> found different mycorrhization levels in sweet basil due to the application of various heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Pb, and Ni) at different concentrations. Yet, lead had no influence on the mycorrhization level in sweet basil roots in our study, although we chose a high lead concentration. This might be due to the fact that
