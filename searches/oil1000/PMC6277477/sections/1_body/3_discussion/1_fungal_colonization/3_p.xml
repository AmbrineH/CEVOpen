<p class="p">Interestingly, the mycorrhization level increased with the simultaneous inoculation with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> in all treatments, except when lead was present in the soil (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). For tomato, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sartipnia et al. (2013)</xref> showed an increased activity of antioxidant enzymes after lead treatment. Such a defense response might influence colonization of beneficial fungi also in sweet basil. Additionally, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gill et al. (2016)</xref> reported a different colonization pattern of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> compared to AMF: They described a biphasic root colonization strategy with a biotrophic colonization pattern where an immune suppression was considered as a precondition for successful root colonization, although this is very host specific (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gill et al., 2016</xref>). Hence we speculate that the 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>-conferred immune suppression might enhance the colonization of AMF in our experiment. This is supported by the fact that wild lettuce inoculated with both mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi enjoyed more benefits than that with a single fungus in a polluted environment (

 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> open new research opportunities for the future.
