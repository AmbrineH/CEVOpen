<p class="p">The majority of vegetable and ornamental crops are host plants for AM fungi (AMF). Growth promotion of plants after inoculation with AMF is known for diverse species, including 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baum et al., 2015</xref>). The effect of AMF on 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> is, however, species specific. Of the previously analyzed AMF 
 <italic class="italic">Funneliformis mosseae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gigaspora margarita</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gigaspora rosea</italic>, only 
 <italic class="italic">F. mosseae</italic> induced significant increase in total biomass of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> plants (

 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> and hence the fungal inoculation might help producers to improve sweet basil growth and quality and support agricultural sustainability.
