<p class="p">In contrast to lead, copper (Cu) is not easily accumulated in the food chain and thus the toxicity to humans and other mammals is relatively low. Additionally, copper is an essential element to plants and is needed for seed production, lignin synthesis, and the biosynthesis of different enzymes. However its concentrations are often elevated in the soil due to the widespread use of copper-containing fungicides, pesticides, and herbicides, especially in soils used for citrus and grapevine production (

At high doses, copper inhibits root morphology, enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the plant, and induces the expression levels of genes related to an oxidative stress response (
