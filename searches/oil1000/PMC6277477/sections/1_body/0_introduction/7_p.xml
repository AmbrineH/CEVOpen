<p class="p">In this study we used the two beneficial fungi, 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>, to investigate their interaction with sweet basil growing in Pb and Cu-contaminated soil. We analyzed sweet basil performance concerning biomass, P uptake, heavy metal accumulation and essential oil content. Because plants in natural or anthropogenic terrestrial ecosystems are usually not dealing with only one single factor at time, we choose a total factorial design for our study.
