<p class="p">As a result of urbanization and industrialization, heavy metal pollution of the soil is a serious problem. It is especially important that soil pollution is kept at a low level that is below the mandatory toxicity limits, when cultivating food crops, or medicinal plants such as sweet basil. In particular, lead (Pb) pollution is a global problem due to its use as an additive in fertilizers and gasoline since the 1920s. On the one hand, there is a trend toward the protection of the environment from lead. But on the other hand, most sewage sludge and other fertilizers used in agriculture are still loaded with lead. Plant uptake is the most important gateway of heavy metals into the food chain and thus into the human body (
