<p class="p">Extensive previous research exists on different varieties and cultivars of sweet basil under the influence of beneficial fungi such as AMF, with respect to the biosynthesis and composition of essential oils, and the generation of biomass and plant fitness (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Battini et al. (2016)</xref> described the impact of dual inoculation with AMF and its associated bacteria and found an improvement of nutraceutical value of sweet basil. Nevertheless, little research has been initiated on the impact of beneficial fungi on sweet basil under heavy metal stress. However many investigations of the responses of other plants to heavy metal stress inoculated with AMF exist and different plant mechanisms, including the role of mycorrhizal fungi for heavy metal tolerance are surveyed by
