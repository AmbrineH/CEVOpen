<p class="p">Since it is known that AMF increase the P uptake (P concentration [mg/g] Ã— DW [g]) in plants, we measured the P concentration in the dried shoot material to confirm the mycorrhizal effect and to examine the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> under the different heavy metal treatments. Mycorrhizal plants untreated with heavy metals showed a significant increase in P uptake (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). This effect was also visible when the soil was contaminated with copper but not when the soil was contaminated with lead or both heavy metals. Plants inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> showed a tendency to have a higher P uptake in uncontaminated soil and soil contaminated with lead or copper, respectively. When both fungi were present, the effect disappeared in non-contaminated soils, but resembled the mycorrhization effect, if heavy metals were present.
