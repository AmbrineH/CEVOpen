<p class="p">Mycorrhization was detected and quantified in the roots by staining, controls remain untreated and no colonization was observed (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1A,B</xref> and data not shown). The highest level of mycorrhization was discovered in plants inoculated with both fungi on soil neither treated with copper nor with lead with 63% AM fungal structures in root pieces (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>). Only the simultaneous application of copper and lead significantly decreased mycorrhization. When both fungi were present, the mycorrhization decreased significantly in lead contaminated soil compared to normal soil. The lowest mycorrhizal colonization with only 46% was visible when only 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> was present and the soil was contaminated with both heavy metals (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1B</xref>). In general we found that mycorrhization increased with the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>, except in lead contaminated soil. Furthermore the mycorrhization intensity decreased when the soil was contaminated with copper but not with lead.
