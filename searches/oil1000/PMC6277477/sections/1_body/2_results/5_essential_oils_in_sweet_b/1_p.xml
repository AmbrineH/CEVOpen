<p class="p">Linalool, eugenol, eucalyptol and methyl chavicol were measured by GC in sweet basil shoots. Remarkably, the linalool concentration was increased only when the plants were mycorrhizal. Linalool levels increased even when the soil was contaminated with either lead or copper, but not when both heavy metals were present (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5A</xref>). The eugenol concentration was impaired when the roots were colonized with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>, but this effect was only significant when the soil was contaminated with lead. 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> seemed to have no effect on the eugenol concentration (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5B</xref>). The effect of mycorrhization on eucalyptol resembled the effect on linalool. It increased when the plants grow in uncontaminated soil and in soil containing lead or copper. But eucalyptol did not increase in mycorrhizal plants when both heavy metals were present in the soil (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5C</xref>). The methylchavicol concentration was dramatically increased when the roots were mycorrhizal. This effect was only visible in uncontaminated soil and not in the soils contaminated with heavy metals (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5D</xref>).
