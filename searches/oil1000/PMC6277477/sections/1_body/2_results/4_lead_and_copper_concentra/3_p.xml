<p class="p">Interestingly the copper concentration in the shoots decreased only when the plants were inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>, not when they were only mycorrhizal (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>). In this case the copper concentration in the shoots remained stable at 13 mg/kg. Fungal treatments did not have any effect on the copper concentration in the roots when the soil was contaminated with copper. When both heavy metals were present in the soil, the copper concentration decreased in shoots for all fungal treatments (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>). The copper concentration in the roots increased significantly only when both heavy metals were present and when the roots were mycorrhizal.
