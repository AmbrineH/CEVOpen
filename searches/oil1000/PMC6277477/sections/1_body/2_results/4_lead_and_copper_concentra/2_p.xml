<p class="p">The lead concentration in sweet basil shoots decreased significantly when the plants were colonized with 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>, with the lowest amount being measured when both fungi were present (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>). The lead concentration in the shoot decreased from 12,98 mg/kg without fungal inoculation to 6,32mg/kg when the plants were inoculated with both fungi. No differences were found in the lead concentrations in the roots. When the soil was contaminated with both heavy metals, fungal inoculations had a similar effect in the shoots, however plants colonized with both fungi did not show a lower value compared to the mycorrhizal plants. In contrast to the roots growing on lead contaminated soil, the roots on soil contaminated with both heavy metals showed an increase in lead concentration when inoculated with the fungi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>).
