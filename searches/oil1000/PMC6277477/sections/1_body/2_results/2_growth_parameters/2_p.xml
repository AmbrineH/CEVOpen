<p class="p">Root dry weight showed similar effects (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2C</xref>); except that 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> treated plants had significantly higher root dry weight also when the soil was contaminated with copper. Also, shoot fresh weight, plant height and number of leaves showed similar responses to heavy metals and root colonization with a few minor exceptions (Supplementary Figures
