<p class="p">In order to test the impact of the two fungi and heavy metal treatments on sweet basil growth, different growth parameters were measured 5 weeks after inoculation. These parameters were the plant height, the number of leaves per plant, the shoot fresh weight (Supplementary Figures 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10" class="xref">S1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11" class="xref">S2</xref>), and the shoot and root dry weight (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). No obvious symptoms (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>) and no change in dry matter were visible on the plant parts of sweet basil growing on heavy metal contaminated soil (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B,C</xref>). Within our 144 plants we saw only 5 plants randomly distributed in the treatments with obvious disease symptoms (data not shown). An overall trend was visible that both fungi promoted an increase in biomasses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). More precisely, sweet basil shoot dry weights were not changing with heavy metal treatment, but were significantly increased if roots were colonized with either 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> or with 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic>. Interestingly, the increase was not significant when both fungi were present, in case of the combined Cu and Pb treatment and no heavy metal treatment. However, both fungi increased fresh weight significantly, although less than for the single fungal treatment (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11" class="xref">S2</xref>). Even under heavy metal treatment, shoot dry weight was significantly increased when the plants were mycorrhizal with 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic>. In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> conferred a growth promotion only in uncontaminated soil and soil contaminated with lead (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>). When both fungi were present in heavy metal contaminated soil, the effect resembled the mycorrhization effect.
