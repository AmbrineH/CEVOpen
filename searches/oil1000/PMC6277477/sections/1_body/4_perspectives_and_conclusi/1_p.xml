<p class="p">A tremendous amount of literature is available on the role of phytohormones related to plant-microbe interactions. Results range from how mycorrhizal fungi develop and colonize plant roots – which in some cases are mutated in specific phytohormone pathways – to how this has an impact on plant fitness. The more research was done the more complex the situation became (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ben Massoud et al., 2018</xref>). Our experimental setup has the potential to shed light on many of these processes if phytohormone levels and specific gene expression levels measurements are included. Using the resulting data checking a putative connection to the essential oil production of sweet basil seems worthwhile, as it is known that these secondary metabolites serve as defense and signal compounds. Furthermore, their biosynthesis is also regulated by phytohormones.
