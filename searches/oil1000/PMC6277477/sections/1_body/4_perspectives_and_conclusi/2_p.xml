<p class="p">The industrially used herb 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> represents a suitable host for both the beneficial fungi 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica.</italic> Both fungi have the ability to increase shoot and root weights after inoculation. Particularly, these increases were also visible in the presence of heavy metals in the soil. Linalool and Eucalyptol concentrations were dramatically changed in the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">R. irregularis</italic> but not in the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic>. Furthermore both fungi protected sweet basil shoots from lead uptake, but only 
 <italic class="italic">S. indica</italic> was able to protect the plants from copper uptake. For this reason, the use of beneficial fungi might be a helpful tool to lower heavy metal concentration in final agricultural products and to improve essential oil contents.
