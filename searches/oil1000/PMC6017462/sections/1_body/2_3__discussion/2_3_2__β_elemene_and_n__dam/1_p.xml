<p class="p">The literature data show the activity of many essential oils containing β-elemene (including EO from 
 <italic class="italic">C. wenyujin</italic>) against different pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]; however, the activity of β-elemene itself was studied only by Zhu et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and our team. In the previous report, β-elemene was active against Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (strain different than in our study), as well as against fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Malassezia furfur</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The results of this study show no activity of β-elemene against tested bacteria with exception of 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra. What is more, only our previous work [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], together with this study, describe the influence of β-elemene on 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. The investigated earlier, isolated strain of 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> was more sensitive to β-elemene action than that used in the current study H37Ra reference strain; however, the activity of this compound against 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> is still noticeable, making β-elemene worthy f further testing. Investigated in this study, 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> EO showed similar activity to β-elemene activity against 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> and no activity against other microorganisms. The other studies investigating extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> seeds and from callus cultures also showed no activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and yeast [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, Fico et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] described that EO of 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> inhibited the growth of several bacteria strains in an agar disc diffusion assay. The differences in the observed activity may be explained by different methodology used to evaluate examined samples.
