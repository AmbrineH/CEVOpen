<p class="p">The performed study showed that isolated β-elemene is twofold more potent against 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> than whole 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> essential oil, in which β-elemene constitutes almost 50%. It may suggest that the main ingredient is responsible for the activity of EO. Our findings are in agreement with those published previously by Zhu et al., 2013, who also observed that β-elemene is twofold more active against 
 <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma wenyujin</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. This confirms that studied compound is the main one responsible for EO activity. However, the literature data also presents opposite results, suggesting the synergistic action of essential oils constituents, which is expressed in lower MIC values obtained for whole essential oil compared to its main ingredients [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>].
