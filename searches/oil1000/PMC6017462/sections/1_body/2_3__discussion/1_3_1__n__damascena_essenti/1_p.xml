<p class="p">EO used in this study was obtained from seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> cultivated in Poland, and it contained 47% of β-elemene. Higher content of β-elemene, reaching up to 73%, was reported previously by D’Antuono et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and by Moretti et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, results similar to ours were obtained by Fico et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and by Wajs et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], who also found β-elemene content in the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> seeds equal to 50% and 59%, respectively. The chemical composition of essential oils and plant extracts is influenced by different factors, among which climate, growing conditions, or harvest time are the most studied [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The essential oil used in our study was hydrodistilled form seeds obtained from market in Poland. Wajs et al. also studied polish seeds purchased from the market [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, Fico, who found similar content of β-elemene (49%), studied seeds from plants grown in Italy. Interestingly, they concluded that seeds from wild plants are less abundant in β-elemene compared to commercial seeds (38% vs. 49%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. This finding is in agreement with higher content of compound of interest found in seeds harvested from plants grown from commercial seeds [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]; hence, not only the plant origin, but what is more more important, the plant cultivation, influence the content of β-elemene in essential oil. According to Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> essential oil is the richest alternative to 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizoma curcuma</italic> source of β-elemene. This source can be used in elemene processing industry delivering β-elemene for antineoplastic medicine. Therefore, we aimed to elaborate the protocol for β-elemene isolation from mentioned essential oil applying HPCCC technique.
