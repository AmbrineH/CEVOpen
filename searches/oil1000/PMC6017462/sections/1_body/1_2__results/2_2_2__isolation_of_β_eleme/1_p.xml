The additional variants of mixture of petroleum ether/acetonitrile/acetone (systems 3 and 4) gave satisfactory K

The final separation was carried out in a mixture of petroleum ether/acetonitrile/acetone in the ratio 2:1.5:0.5, with a good retention of stationary phase (78%). β-elemene was eluted between 55–70 min (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00256" class="xref">Supplementary Materials: Figure S1</xref>), and its purity in the fractions ranged from 87 to 96%. The optimization of the sample mass revealed that the best purity (96%) and yield (80%) was obtained when 100 mg of essential oil was used (
