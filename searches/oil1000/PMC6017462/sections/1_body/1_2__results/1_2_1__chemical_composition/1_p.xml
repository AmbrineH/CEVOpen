<p class="p">GC-MS analysis was used to confirm a proper selection of source material for β-elemene isolation. 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> essential oil (EO) obtained via hydrodistillation constituted 0.436% of dry plant material. 29 compounds representing over 99% of the total EO were identified (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00256-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), with β-elemene being the main ingredient and accounting for 47.37% in the EO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00256-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The other compounds present in the amount above 10% and listed according to the elution time were β-selinene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-selinene, and damascenine. Based on these data, we subjected 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> EO to HPCCC separation as optimal source for β-elemene isolation.
