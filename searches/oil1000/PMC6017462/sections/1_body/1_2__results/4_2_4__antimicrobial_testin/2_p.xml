<p class="p">The control with DMSO solvent confirmed that there is no influence of the solvent itself on the growth of tested organisms; hence, the obtained results are not false positive. Our findings regarding the use of DMSO solvent are supported by earlier study performed by Oâ€™Neill et al., who studied the minimal inhibitory effect of this solvent against

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Both research teams found the 2% DMSO concentration is maximal acceptable with regard to the compromise between solubility of tested compounds and providing sufficient bacteria growth. In our study, 1% DMSO was used, because the solubility of studied samples was not problematic in this concentration.
