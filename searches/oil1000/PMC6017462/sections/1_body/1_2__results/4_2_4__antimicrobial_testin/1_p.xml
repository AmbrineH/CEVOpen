<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of isolated Î²-elemene, as well as 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> essential oil, was checked against standard panel of microorganisms including Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and mycobacterial strains. The MIC reading was normalized against controls with 1% DMSO (with bacteria/yeasts) and blanks (without bacteria/yeasts), and compared with the positive control drugs. Normalization means that antibiotics with MIC values known for the tested set of strains were used. The obtained control values were within the reference ranges, which proves that the MIC test was performed correctly.
