 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Also, preparative gas chromatography with dimethylpolysiloxane or enantioselective cyclodextrin columns were applied [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Modern techniques based on the principle of liquid-liquid extraction (in which no losses of sample occurs), like high-performance centrifugal partition chromatography (HPCPC) [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] or high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], were used to obtain β-elemene from plant material/essential oil as well. In our study the other modern technique based on the principle of liquid-liquid extraction, high performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC), was applied, because it enables the achievement of a higher 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> level, and thus higher efficiency, compared to high-speed counter-current chromatography. Furthermore, the rapid purification can be obtained due to providing good retention of a high amount of the stationary phase and possibility to use higher flow rate of the mobile phase [
