<p class="p">There is little information regarding antimicrobial action of β-elemene. What is more, the increasing incidence of multi drug resistance of microorganisms to different antibiotics and chemotherapeutics is a strong reason for searching for new active agents [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Sesquiterpenes isolated from essential oils are among compounds with promising antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Also, β-elemene is natural sesquiterpene; therefore, it is worth to check the antimicrobial activity of this compound against different pathogens including mycobacteria.
