<p class="p">The round bottom microwell plates were prepared as follows: in each well, 50 μL of inoculum and 50 μL of tested substances were combined. The final density of inoculum in each well was approx. 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL for all bacterial strains and approx. 2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> CFU/mL for yeast strains. The sterility, growth, and 1% DMSO controls were carried out for each tested strain. The plates were closed with sealing foil to prevent liquid evaporation and incubated at 35 °C except
