<p class="p">GC–MS was performed with a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus coupled to a Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra mass spectrometer (Japan). A fused-silica capillary column ZB-5 MS (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d.) with a film thickness of 0.25 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used. GC-MS conditions applied for analysis of the essential oil and obtained fractions followed Sieniawska et al. [

 <sub class="sub">8</sub>–C
 <sub class="sub">24</sub>) under the same operating conditions. Constituents of studied essential oil were identified by comparison of their mass spectra and retention indices with computer-supported spectral libraries (Mass Finder 2.1 and NIST database) and with authentic standard of β-elemene.
