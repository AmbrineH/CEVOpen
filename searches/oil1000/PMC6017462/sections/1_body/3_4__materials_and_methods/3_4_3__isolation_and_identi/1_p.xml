<p class="p">Isolation was carried out with Spectrum High-performance counter-current chromatographic (HPCCC) equipment purchased from Dynamic Extraction Co., Ltd. (Slough, Berkshire, UK). The two-phase solvent system suitable for further separation was selected according to the partition coefficient (K) of the target compound (

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-00256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The separation was performed in the solvent system composed of petroleum ether, acetonitrile, and acetone in a ratio of 2:1.5:0.5 (

The rotation of bobbins applied was 1600 rpm, while the flow rate was 1 and 6 mL/min in the analytical and preparative conditions, respectively. The optimized analytical conditions were scaled up for preparative separation (from 22 mL coil to 137 mL, respectively). The fractions monitored at 210 nm were collected per minute and analyzed by GC-MS. The mass of sample (100, 165, and 200 mg of essential oil) was optimized to obtain the best preparative separation.
