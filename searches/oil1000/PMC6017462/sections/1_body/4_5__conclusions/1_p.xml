<p class="p">In this work, 
 <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> essential oil was shown to be a new, abundant source of β-elemene. The high purity β-elemene was successfully isolated from this EO for the first time. High-performance counter-current chromatography was proved to be an efficient technique for this sesquiterpene separation, while antimicrobial testing revealed moderate activity of β-elemene against 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra.
