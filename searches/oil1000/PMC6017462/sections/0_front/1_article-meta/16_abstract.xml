 <p class="p">The most commonly used plant source of β-elemene is 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma wenyujin</italic> Y. H. Chen &amp; C. Ling (syn. of 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma aromatic</italic> Salisb.) with its content in supercritical CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract up to 27.83%. However, the other rich source of this compound is 
  <italic class="italic">Nigella damascena</italic> L. essential oil, in which β-elemene accounts for 47%. In this work, the effective protocol for preparative isolation of β-elemene from a new source—
  <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> essential oil—using high performance counter-current chromatography HPCCC was elaborated. Furthermore, since sesquiterpens are known as potent antimicrobials, the need for finding new agents designed to combat multi-drug resistant strains was addressed and the purified target compound and the essential oil were tested for its activity against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and mycobacterial strains. The application of the mixture of petroleum ether, acetonitrile, and acetone in the ratio 2:1.5:0.5 (
  <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>) in the reversed phase mode yielded β-elemene with high purity in 70 min. The results obtained for antimicrobial assay clearly indicated that 
  <italic class="italic">N. damascena</italic> essential oil and isolated β-elemene exert action against 
  <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> strain H37Ra.
