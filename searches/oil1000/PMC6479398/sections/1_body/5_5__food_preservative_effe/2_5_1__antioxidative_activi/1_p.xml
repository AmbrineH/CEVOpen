<p class="p">Fats and oils present in many foods can easily deteriorate due to oxidation in a chain of reactions in which free radicals are formed, propagated, and finally converted into stable oxygenated compounds. It is these oxygenated compounds that are responsible for off-flavors and other undesirable characteristics [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B245-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">245</xref>,
 <xref rid="B246-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. However, when antioxidants are added to such foods, the shelf life is extended because the lipid peroxidation process is retarded. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and propyl gallate (PG) have been used as food additives since the beginning of the 20th century in food industries, but there are some arguments about the safety and possible adverse effects of these substances [
 <xref rid="B245-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">245</xref>]. The species 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> (black pepper) is used as a spice in many countries of the world due to the presence of piperine, which may contribute its value as a food additive. The antioxidant activities of black pepper EO and oleoresins were evaluated and compared to those of BHA, BHT, and PG synthetic antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. The authors found that both the EO and oleoresins showed strong antioxidant activity in comparison with synthetic oxidants. The results of this study demonstrated that black pepper can be used as an easily accessible source of natural antioxidants and as a safe food preservative. It has been shown that the addition of black pepper powder in cottage cheese at a 1.0% level considerably improved the flavor and aesthetic quality of the product. In addition, the black pepper powder extended the shelf life of the product from 8 to 14 days without affecting sensory and textural properties in comparison to the control sample [
 <xref rid="B247-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">247</xref>]. Similarly, the antioxidant properties of EOs from some other 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> spp. such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> were evaluated by Prakash et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The results of the study demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> EO exhibited strong antioxidant potential as its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) value (3.6 μg/mL) was close to that of ascorbic acid (3.2 μg/mL) and lower than that of the synthetic antioxidants such as BHT (7.4 μg/mL) and BHA (4.5 μg/mL). This finding is further supported in a study by Nakatani et al. [
 <xref rid="B248-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">248</xref>] which revealed that phenolic amides from 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> spp. possess significant antioxidant activities that are more effective than the naturally occurring antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol. For example, one amide, feruperine, exhibits antioxidant activity as high as that of the synthetic antioxidants, BHA and BHT. These studies thus indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> spp. has special merits with regard to enhancement of the shelf life of food products.
