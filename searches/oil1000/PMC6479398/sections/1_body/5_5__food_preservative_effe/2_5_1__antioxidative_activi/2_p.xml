 <xref rid="B245-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">245</xref>]. The antioxidant mechanisms of black pepper extracts may be attributed to a strong hydrogen-donating ability, metal chelating ability, and the effectiveness of these extracts as good scavengers of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and free radicals. Black pepper oleoresin (BPO) is a source of biologically active compounds that are responsible for food preservation [
 <xref rid="B249-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">249</xref>]. However, low stability and solubility in water are two limiting factors for BPO, with some of its components being sensitive to light, heat and oxygen which compromise BPO’s chemical and sensorial characteristics [

 <xref rid="B252-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">252</xref>] developed BPO-BCD (β-cyclodextrin) inclusion complexes using the kneading and freeze drying methods which were more effective in keeping BPO active properties for longer periods and thereby delaying oxidative reactions and the growth of microorganisms.
