<p class="p">The abovementioned studies suggest that not only the seeds but also leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> could be potential candidates for developing new antimicrobial agents for a wide range of pathogenic bacteria and fungal strains. For example, Pauli [
 <xref rid="B260-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">260</xref>] reported the mechanism of action of the components present in betel leaf EO compounds such as sesquiterpene, monoterpenes, and phenylpropanes where these compounds are similar to other terpenes and phenolic compounds involved in the destruction of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane that leads to cellular material coagulation. Another study by Basak and Guha [
 <xref rid="B261-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">261</xref>] describes the effect of betel leaf EO on spore inactivation and the cell viability of 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum</italic> and its antifungal activity in raw apple juice. These authors reported that the cells of 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic> lose viability when treated with EO. Since spore inactivation or the inhibition of spore germination is necessary in order to restrict fungal infection and mycotoxin production in food, the use of 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> leaf extract as a natural antifungal agent in food systems is very promising.
