<p class="p">Black pepper (
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>) volatile oil has been proven to have antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B253-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">253</xref>]. The phenolic compounds of black pepper are believed to be responsible for this antimicrobial activity by damaging the membranes of bacteria restricting their growth [
 <xref rid="B254-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">254</xref>]. Black pepper has also been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity with reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of around 50–500 ppm and inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus faecalis.</italic> In addition, black pepper has demonstrated inhibition against some Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B254-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">254</xref>]. Black pepper EO is composed primarily of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B255-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">255</xref>]. This EO has also been used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio cholerae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus albus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium diphthereae, Shigella dysenteriae, Streptomyces faecalis, Bacillus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> spp. in addition to suspending the growth and production of aflatoxins produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus parasiticus</italic>. These effects are due to chemical constituents such as piperazine, piperanine, piperidine A and piperolein B [
 <xref rid="B255-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">255</xref>]. To enhance the effect of EOs, these compounds can be encapsulated. In a recent study, Rakmai et al. [
 <xref rid="B256-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">256</xref>] demonstrated that cyclodextrins can be used as an encapsulating agent that can protect the active compounds. These authors found that following encapsulation in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), the antibacterial activity of black pepper oil improved by a factor of four against 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <italic class="italic">. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Akthar et al. [
 <xref rid="B257-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">257</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial activity of leaf extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and fungi (
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>). The methanol extract exhibited greater antimicrobial activity against the selected bacterial and fungal strains. The MIC results showed that ethanol, methanol and petroleum ether leaf extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> at a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL. The MIC values for ethanol, methanol and petroleum ether leaf extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> were at a concentration of 25.0 mg/mL. Similarly, the minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations of all the tested solvent leaf extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> plants ranged between 12.5–50.0 mg/mL for all tested strains. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01364-t028" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 28</xref> lists the efficacy of black pepper extracts and black pepper EOs against food spoilage and foodborne pathogens. In addition to 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>, other spp. of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> plants have also been studied. One recent study demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion of betel leaf (
 <italic class="italic">Piper betle</italic> L.) EO. The formulated nanoemulsions had a MIC of 0.5–1.25 µL/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 1–2.5 µL/mL against five strains of Gram-positive (
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, B. cereus</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, P. aeruginosa</italic>) bacteria. Such formulated nanoemulsions can thus serve as natural antimicrobial agents for food systems [
 <xref rid="B258-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">258</xref>]. Similarly, Nouri and Nafchi [
 <xref rid="B259-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">259</xref>] observed the antimicrobial activity of betel leaf extract against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
