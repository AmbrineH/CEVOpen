<p class="p">Most of the studies were performed using in vitro models, so in vivo experimental approaches are needed to demonstrate the 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species potentialities. In this sense, 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> has been studied on different animal models infected with parasites. For example, using experimental infections of 
 <italic class="italic">Giardia lamblia</italic> in Mongolian gerbils [
 <xref rid="B304-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">304</xref>], a significant decline in cyst shedding in treated gerbils with the aqueous extract was appreciated; 
 <italic class="italic">Neospora caninum</italic>-infected mice, treated also with 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> extract, showed reduced mouse clinical scores and increased survival rates [
 <xref rid="B270-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">270</xref>]; and finally, 
 <italic class="italic">T. gondii</italic> in vivo infection resulted in 100% mouse survival after treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="B284-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">284</xref>].
