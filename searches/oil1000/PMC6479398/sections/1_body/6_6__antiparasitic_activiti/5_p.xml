<p class="p">Scarce studies were found about antiparasite mechanisms of action for either extracts or EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species. This observation could be logical since both products are complex mixtures of compounds, which could present several activities, act on multiple targets and cause the death of parasite by different mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis have been the events more often described, as the evidences of
