<p class="p">According to Burfield [

 <italic class="italic">Piper cubeba</italic> are mainly composed of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and specifically β-caryophyllene, δ-cadinene, α- and β-cubebenes, and minor amounts of monoterpenes. The survey by Lawrence [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] describes a similar scenario, the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represent the main class of constituents, with α-copaene, β-cubebene,
