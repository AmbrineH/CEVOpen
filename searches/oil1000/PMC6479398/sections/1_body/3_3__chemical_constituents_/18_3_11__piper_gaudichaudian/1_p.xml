<p class="p">According to Schindler and Heinzmann [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] the literature on 
 <italic class="italic">P. gaudichaudianum</italic> EOs reports a generic composition characterized by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (22.5 to 36.4%), with smaller percentages of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (0.2 to 5.8%), trace amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons and no oxygenated monoterpenoids. However, the authors found in their analyses that the EOs from leaves and reproductive organs had a strikingly different composition, and were dominated by the phenylpropanoid class, and in particular by dillapiole, which in fresh leaves was at levels between 68.4% and 69.2%, and in the inflorescences between 83.1% and 87.5% [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Myristicin was also present in the reproductive organs in the range of 6.2 to 11.9%. This high percentage of phenylpropanoids left less room for other constituents, but the main ones were α-humulene (13.3–37.5%), β-caryophyllene (10.4–19.3%), β-pinene (5.6–7.0%), (
