<p class="p">The EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper arboreum</italic>, and specifically that obtained from the leaves, is on average dominated by sesquiterpenoids, particularly by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and secondarily by their oxygenated derivatives; monoterpenoids only play a minor role. According to dos Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], the EO from the leaves contains 65.85% of sesquiterpenes, 22.59% as hydrocarbons and 43.26% as oxygenated derivatives, and only 4.28% of monoterpenes (see
