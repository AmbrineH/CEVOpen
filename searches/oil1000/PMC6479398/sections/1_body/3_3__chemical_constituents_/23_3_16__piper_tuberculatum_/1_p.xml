 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] three leaf EO samples from Brazil, all dominated by sesquiterpenoids, have been compared. In two cases the most important compound was β-caryophyllene at 26.3% and 40.2%, and in the third one it was spathulenol at 15.8% [

A fruit EO sample from Brazil was instead dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons (73.95%), mainly by β-pinene (27.74%) and α-pinene (26.54%), with sesquiterpene hydrocarbons at 22.8%, and β-caryophyllene at 14.38%. The oxygenated compounds for both mono and sesquiterpenes only summed up to 7% [
