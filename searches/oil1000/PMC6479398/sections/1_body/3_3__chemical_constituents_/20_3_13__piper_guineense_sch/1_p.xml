<p class="p">There have been several reports of 
 <italic class="italic">P. guineense</italic> fruit EOs. The composition is varied and the main compounds have been identified as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and phenylpropanoids [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], and there is evidence of the existence of many chemotypes, the most important ones the dillapiole CT, β-caryophyllene CT, β-pinene CT, linalool CT [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], and the relatively new type, myristicin + ishwarane CT from Cameroon [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Martins et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] describe the aerial parts EO from S. Tomé e Príncipe with elevated amounts of dillapiole and myristicin, and Jirovetz et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] describe a black 
 <italic class="italic">P. guineense</italic> fruit EO from Cameroon with, as major compounds, β-caryophyllene, β-elemene, bicyclogermacrene and α-humulene, and the white version of the fruit containing mainly β-caryophyllene, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene, limonene, β-pinene, linalool and α-humulene. Oyedeji et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] also cite EOs from Cameroon dominated by α-pinene, β-pinene; from Nigeria dominated by myristicin and savisan; and from Congo dominated by linalool, myristicin and β-caryophyllene. An EO from Nigeria is characterized by monoterpenoids at 55.6% [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], while a second EO again from Nigeria is dominated by sesquiterpenoids at 64.4% and monoterpenoids at 21.3% [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], and an EO from Colombia has total sesquiterpenes at 74.4%, with oxygenated sesquiterpenoides at 46.4%, followed by sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons at 28.0% [
