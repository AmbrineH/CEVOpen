<p class="p">As suggested above, there are chemical differences which many authors have declared to be due to the existence of chemotypes. According to da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] there is evidence of chemotypes for at least seven of the Neotropical species: 
 <italic class="italic">Piper aduncum</italic> leaf EOs seem to come in nine chemotypes (CTs), dominated by 1,8-cineole, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol, dillapiole, and asaricin; 
 <italic class="italic">Piper amalago</italic> has monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid CTs; 
 <italic class="italic">Piper cernuum</italic> leaf oils are dominated by dihydroagarofuran, monoterpene hydrocarbons or sesquiterpene hydrocarbons; 
 <italic class="italic">Piper divaricatum</italic> shows two CTs, an eugenol/methyl eugenol CT and a safrole CT; 
 <italic class="italic">Piper marginatum</italic> from Brazil is dominated by phenylpropanoids but there are wide variations in the specific molecules; 
 <italic class="italic">Piper hispidum</italic> leaf EOs from Cuba are dominated by eudesmol, those from Panama by dillapiole, and those from Colombia by (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol; and finally 
 <italic class="italic">Piper umbellatum</italic> EOs from Costa Rica and Brazil are dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, while those from Cuba by camphor and safrole.
