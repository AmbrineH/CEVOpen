 <italic class="italic">P. umbellatum</italic> EOs from Costa Rica and from Brazil, were rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Brazilian EOs had as main compounds germacrene D (34.2–55.8%), δ-cadinene (15.0%), bicyclogermacrene (9.0–11.8%) γ-muurolene (8.9%), β-caryophyllene (6.3%), and γ-cadinene (5.9%) [

A recent paper confirms these findings, with the three main compounds β-selinene (16.12%), bicyclogermacrene (10.64%) and β-caryophyllene (5.35%); EOs from Costa Rica were quite similar, with main compounds β-caryophyllene (28.3%), germacrene D (16.7%), (
