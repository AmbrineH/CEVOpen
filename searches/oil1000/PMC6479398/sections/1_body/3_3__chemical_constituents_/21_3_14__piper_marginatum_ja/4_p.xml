<p class="p">The EO from the aerial parts seems also dominated by phenylpropanoids, as shown by a sample from Costa Rica with as the principal compound (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-anethole (45.9%), followed by 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-anisaldehyde (22.0%), anisyl methyl ketone (14.2%), estragole (6.6%), and

 <xref rid="B87-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. A sample from Colombia is still characterized by phenylpropanoids but with a very different composition: elemicin (18.0%), α-phellandrene (11.1%), β-caryophyllene (11.0%), limonene (7.5%), isoelemicin (9.2%), β-elemene (4.0%), and bicyclogermacrene (4.0%) [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Of the three Brazilian samples reviewed by da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], two had a a characteristic phenylpropanoid composition, the first contained isoosmorhizol (32.2%), (

 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-isoosmorhizole (11.2%), while the second contained propiopiperone (21.8%), elemol (5.9%), and β-caryophyllene (5.0%). The third sample however has as the main compound
