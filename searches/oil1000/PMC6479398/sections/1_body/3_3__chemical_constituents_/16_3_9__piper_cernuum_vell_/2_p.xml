<p class="p">A similar subdivision can be observed even in other organs’ EOs. An EO from aerial parts of Brazilian plants contained, as major compounds, trans-dihydroagarofuran at 31.0%, elemol at 12.0%, and 10-epi-γ-eudesmol at 13.0%, while an EO from the flowers (again from Brazil) contained α-copaene at 6.5%, β-caryophyllene at 9.8%, germacrene D at 14.3%, bicyclogermacrene at 6.5%, and spathulenol at 9.7%. The authors also analyzed the EO from the branches, and the main compounds present were quite distinct from the other EOs: camphene (46.4%), p-cymene (5.8%), linalool (8.7%), α-terpineol (11.6%), and carvacrol (11.6%) [
