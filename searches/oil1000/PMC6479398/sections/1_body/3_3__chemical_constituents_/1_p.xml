<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> genus is an extremely well known and widely distributed pantropical taxon of aromatic plants, many of which have been used in the past as food and medicinal plants. 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> plants are rich in essential oils (EOs), which can be found in many tissues and organs: fruits, seeds, leaves, branches, roots and stems [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The chemistry of these EOs has been extensively studied since the 1960s, but according to Dyer [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] only about 10% of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species species (112 of 1457 accepted species world-wide, 
 <uri xlink:href="www.theplantlist.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.theplantlist.org</uri>) has been phytochemically studied. For this review it was possible to find chemical information relative to the volatile components for around 130 species, although only for around 16 of them the information is detailed enough.
