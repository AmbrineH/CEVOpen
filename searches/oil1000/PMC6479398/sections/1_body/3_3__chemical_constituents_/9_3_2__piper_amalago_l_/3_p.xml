<p class="p">Da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] report the main components of the EO of aerial parts of Brazilian specimen: limonene (20.5%), zingiberene (11.2%), δ-elemene (6.8%), and α-pinene (5.2%). They also report the main components of a Brazilian, stem-only EO: longifolene (6.6%), α-amorphene (23.3%), and α-muurolol (9.3%). Another stem EO from Brazil was analyzed by dos Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and again it shows a different chemical breakdown from the EO described by da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]: bicyclogermacrene (12.01%), α-cadinol (9.43%), isocaryophyllene (8.32%), γ-muurolol (8.29%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol (5.24%), spathulenol (4.38%), and γ-cadinene (3.77%). Although different from each other, these EOs shows a dominance of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids.
