<p class="p">From the scant data available it appears that EOs from all tissues of

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] describe three EOs distilled from leaves, one from Panama, characterized by safrole (70%), and two from Cuba, characterized one by safrole (64.5%) and camphene (5.5%), and the second by safrole (71.8%).
