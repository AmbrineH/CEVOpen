<p class="p">There are also differences in the composition of EOs distilled from different organs. According to Navickiene et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] who distilled Brazilian specimens, fruit EOs are dominated by monoterpenes (an average of 85.1%), leaf EOs are dominated by sesquiterpenes (specifically by Î²-caryophyllene), while the rare root EO contains mainly monoterpenes but at lower level than fruits (an average of 66.9%).
