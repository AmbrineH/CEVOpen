The EOs from the aerial parts of specimens from the Americas, southeast Asia and Oceania seem dominated by dillapiole (30–90%) but specimens from Bolivia were dominated by 1,8-cineole (40%), those from Panama were rich in sesquiterpenes like β-caryophyllene and aromadendrene, those from Brazil were rich in linalool or (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol and surprisingly devoid of phenylpropanoids, those from Equador were abundant in dillapiole, piperitone and (

The EOs from aerial parts of Cuban plants were particularly rich in oxygenated compounds, both monoterpenoids (50.3%) and sesquiterpenoids (29.2%), with lower amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons (9.7%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (8.2%) [
