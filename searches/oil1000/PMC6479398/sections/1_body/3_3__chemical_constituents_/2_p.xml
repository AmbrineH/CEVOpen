<p class="p">Due to the wide variations in chemical content, and the different tissues from which the EOs were obtained, it is difficult to summarize the nature of the 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> EOs. According to Mgbeahuruioke et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] there are more that 270 identified compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> EOs. In the review by Xiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] the authors state that more than 80 compounds were identified in Chinese 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> spp., and that these compounds belonged mainly to the mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbon classes, followed by aldehydes, alcohols, acids, ketones, esters, and phenols. Some species have a simple profile, while others, such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum, P. betle, P. auritum</italic>, contain very diverse suites of secondary metabolites. According to Mgbeahuruioke et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] it is possible to show several differences in chemical composition of the EOs of fruits and of leaves/aerial parts. Fruit EOs are less chemically diverse than EOs from aerial parts, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds are, generally speaking, the most important chemical classes in fruits and aerial parts, and Î²-caryophyllene is the most important compound in fruit EOs, while it is less important in the leaves.
