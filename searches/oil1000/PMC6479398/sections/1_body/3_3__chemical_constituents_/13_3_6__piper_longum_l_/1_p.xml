<p class="p">A very recent review by Lawrence [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] is summarized in the 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01364-t013" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 13</xref> below, from which it can be seen that the EOs seem to be characterized by non-terpenoid compounds such as pentadecane and heptadecane isomers, and by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons such as germacrene D, β-caryophyllene, and β-selinene. In only one case the characterizing compound is a phenylpropanoid, eugenol.
