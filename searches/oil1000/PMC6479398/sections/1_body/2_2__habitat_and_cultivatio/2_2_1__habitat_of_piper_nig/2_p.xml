 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The ENM tool has been applied to many problems in evolutionary ecology, invasive-species management, biogeography, and conservation. The distributions of crops in ecological and geographical locations can be outlined using the ENM tool. It is useful for the introduction and conservation of species. It is also useful in applications where detailed information regarding the geographic distribution of species is required [
