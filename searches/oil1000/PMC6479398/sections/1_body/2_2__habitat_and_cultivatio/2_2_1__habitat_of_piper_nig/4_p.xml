Thus, such requirements limit dispersal of this species and do not allow the species to gain larger geographical distribution. Similarly, the conditions of Hainan province of China are more suitable for cultivation of black pepper. The temperature of this area is usually between 22.5 to 25.6 Â°C with 1640 mm of average rainfall each year. Such conditions have low management cost, great efficacy, and a better output [
