<p class="p">ENM-based studies predict that the eastern as well as western coasts of the Indian Peninsula, various regions of the Malay Archipelago, the southeast coastal areas of China and the eastern part of Sumatra Island consist of areas having the highest probabilities (&gt;50%) [

The biological characteristics of the species and visual assessment of the predicted regions were like each other. The Malabar Coast in India is the origin of black pepper. Black pepper was then taken to Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries. India has about 2000 years history of black pepper cultivation, during which black pepper expanded its geographical range. It is understandable that bioclimatic and current distributions of black pepper are basically similar.
