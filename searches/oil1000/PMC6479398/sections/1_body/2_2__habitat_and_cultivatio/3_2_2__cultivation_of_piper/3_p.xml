<p class="p">Studies were carried out to check the suitability for the cultivation of black pepper. Such studies reported that there are suitable areas in North Vietnam where black pepper could be introduced and cultivated in the future [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Conclusively, there is much need to conserve the wild varieties of black pepper. This is required to preserve the genetic resources for use in the future. This can be done through model prediction along with the distribution map of black pepper’s wild varieties. The conservation efforts can further be improved by understanding gene flow patterns and genetic structure of wild black pepper. Move above-this is “habitat”
