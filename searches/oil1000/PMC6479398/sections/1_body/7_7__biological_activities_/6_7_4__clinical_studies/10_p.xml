<p class="p">In a placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized clinical study the aqueous extract of kava was evaluated for the efficacy outcomes on anxiety, as well as was assessed on a range of secondary outcomes including liver function tests, withdrawal or addiction and femaleâ€™s sexual drive [
 <xref rid="B417-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">417</xref>]. Seventy five patients with GAD were administered with one tablet of kava twice a day (delivering 120 mg of kavalactones per day which could be increased to two tablets twice per day in non-response group-delivering 240 mg of kavalactones) for 6-weeks. The study contained a matched placebo group. Kava treatment resulted in significant reduction of anxiety as measured by HAMA score compared to placebo group [

 <xref rid="B418-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">418</xref>]. No significant adverse reactions were found in kava group. In terms of liver function tests, no significant differences were detected across groups. Besides, no variations were reported between groups in terms of withdrawal or addiction behavior. According to Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), kava resulted in significant increase in female sexual drive as compared to placebo. In males, negative effects were not reported. Interestingly, it was found that there was a highly significant correlation between improved sexual function and performance (decrease in ASEX score) and anxiety reduction in the whole sample. As a part of this trial, they also examined GABA transporter polymorphisms as potential pharmacogenetic markers of kava response and found that specific polymorphisms appear to potentially modify anxiolytic response to kava [
