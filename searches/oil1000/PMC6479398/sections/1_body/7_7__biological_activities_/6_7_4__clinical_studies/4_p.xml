<p class="p">Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on thirteen patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) [
 <xref rid="B407-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">407</xref>]. Patients were administered with kava 280 mg/day (standardized to 30% kavalactones) or placebo for 4 weeks. In this study two indication of vagal control which were defined as baroreflex control of heart rate (BRC) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed. Accordingly, more patients showed significantly improved BRC following treatment with kava than with placebo. The magnitude of improvement in BRC was found to be significantly correlated with the degree of clinical improvement. In contrast, treatment with kava did not alter the magnitude of RSA, a measure of the heart rate changes occurring with respiration.
