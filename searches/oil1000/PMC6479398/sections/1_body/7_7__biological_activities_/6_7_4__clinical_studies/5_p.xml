In a 3-months randomized, prospective open study, the effects of Kava extract at two different doses (100 mg and 200 mg/day) were investigated in 80 perimenopausal women [
 <xref rid="B413-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">413</xref>]. Several parameters such as anxiety assessed by state trait anxiety inventory scale, depression evaluated by Zung’s scale and climacteric symptoms shown by Greene’s scale were measured after first and third months. A placebo group was not included to the study and to compare the effects of Kava extract, a control group was used. As a result, in kava-treated groups, while anxiety and climacteric score declined at first and third months, depression was reduced at the third month. However, in the control group anxiety, depression and climacteric symptoms also showed decreasing tendency, so these findings were not significant.
