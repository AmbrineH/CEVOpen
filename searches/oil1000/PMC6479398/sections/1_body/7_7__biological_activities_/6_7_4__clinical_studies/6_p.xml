<p class="p">In a double-blind and placebo-controlled trial, 50 anxiety patients with non-psychotic origin were treated by kava extract (WS 1490) 150 mg/daily for 4-week of period followed by 2-week observation phase to draw significant information on dosage range, safety, and efficacy of the preparation. For the primary efficacy variable assessed by HAMA score, kava treatment resulted in a significant reduction in anxiety as compared to placebo. For the secondary variables evaluated by HAMA subscales ‘somatic anxiety’ and ‘psychic anxiety’, a statistically significant advantage of the kava treatment over placebo was found to be detectable [

At the beginning and end of the trial, the laboratory tests demonstrated no pathological changes in the generalized biochemical parameters such as blood counts, hepatic enzyme levels, total bilirubin, glucose, and some lipid profiles. Therefore, it was concluded that the special kava extract can be classified as a well-tolerated and safe preparation without any drug-induced adverse reactions or symptoms associated with withdrawal.
