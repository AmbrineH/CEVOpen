<p class="p">In another double-blind clinical trial which was also carried out to investigate safety and efficacy profile of the same pharmaceutical kava extract (WS1490), 61 patients with sleep disturbances associated with anxiety, tension and restlessness states of non-psychotic origin were treated with daily doses of 200 mg extract or placebo over a period of 4 weeks [

Efficacy of kava was also indicated in the treatment of anxiety evaluated by HAMA scores. More prominent effects in terms of well-being based on self-rating and of global clinical assessment were also shown for kava extract. In clinical and laboratory parameters no differences were observed among groups. Besides, no drug-related adverse events or changes were seen. Safety and tolerability of kava were reported as good. Therefore, beyond the general anxiolytic effect of kava extract demonstrated in various controlled clinical trials this study evidenced that sleeping disorders related to non-psychotic anxiety may be treated by kava extract in an effective and safe ways.
