<p class="p">Not only 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> extracts but also major bioactive components of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> plants, mainly piperine, piperlongumine, and flavokawain B (FKB), have been investigated as potential anticancer agents in several studies. Piperine is a kind of pungent alkaloid found in 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. longum</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B316-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">316</xref>]. Besides its anticancer effectw, it has been reported as an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and cardiovascular protective agent [

 <xref rid="B320-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">320</xref>]. Furthermore, its anti-angiogenic characteristic was shown for the very first time in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B321-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">321</xref>]. According to this study, piperine inhibited the proliferation of HUVEC cells via inhibiting G1/S transition, cell migration and tubule formation without toxic effect. As compared to control groups, 100 Î¼M piperine treatment inhibited the activation of PKB through phosphorylation from the residues of Ser 473 and Thr 308 in HUVEC cells, whereas it had no effect on protein expression of TRPV1. In ex vivo test design, inhibition of tubule development was achieved in the treatment group of rat aorta angiogenesis model.
