<p class="p">In another study, it was reported that piperine has potent antitumor activity against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) [
 <xref rid="B326-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">326</xref>]. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses presented its selective inhibition effect on cell growth. Controlled cell death induced by piperine was shown through the mitochondrial pathway and through the suppression of Akt activation in breast cancer cells. In a recent study, piperine exhibited antitumor property against human ovarian cancer cell line (A2780) [
 <xref rid="B327-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">327</xref>]. Cell viability was reduced in piperine-treated cancer cells whereas no significant changes were seen in normal cell line. The proportions of phosphorylated forms of JNK and p38 MAPK protein to non-phosphorylated forms were increased by piperine treatment in dose-dependent manner suggesting that JNK and p38 MAPK mediate intrinsic apoptotic pathway in ovarian cancer cells.
