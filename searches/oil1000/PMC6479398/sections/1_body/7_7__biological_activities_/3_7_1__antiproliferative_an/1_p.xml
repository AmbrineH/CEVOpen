 <xref rid="B307-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">307</xref>]. Mankind has traditionally used plants to self-treat health problems throughout history; nowadays researchers focus on understanding the action mechanism of plant-based chemicals and identifying effective sources for new drugs [
 <xref rid="B308-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">308</xref>]. Naturally occurring plant-based chemicals serve alternative approaches regarding chemotherapy and chemoprevention with relatively fewer side effects. In the present section, in vitro and in vivo studies involving evaluation of the anti-proliferative, anticancer and chemopreventive effects of both extracts and bioactive constituents from
