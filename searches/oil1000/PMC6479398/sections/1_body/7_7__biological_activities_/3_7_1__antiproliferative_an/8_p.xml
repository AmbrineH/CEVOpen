Piperine also reduced cell migration by interfering with several signaling pathways including Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Piperine demonstrated similar effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) found within blood vessels by inducing arrest at cell cycle and suppressing the activation of the MAPK through phosphorylation [
