<p class="p">In the study of da NÃ³brega et al. [
 <xref rid="B342-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">342</xref>], nineteen PL analogues have been synthesized by using the 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid-like starting material, and their cytotoxic potencies were screened in U87MG glioblastoma cell line. Among these test compounds, 
 <italic class="italic">(E)</italic>-benzhydryl 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl) acrylate, which has two aromatic rings in the side-chain, presented the best inhibition effects on viability of U87MG cell line in a dose dependent manner by oxidative and apoptotic processes. In this study, the biosafety of this compound was also assessed by sister chromatid exchange and 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine assays in human peripheral blood cells. Results indicated that this synthesized compond would be promising an agent selectively cytotoxic and genotoxic to cancer cells as well as with strong bioavailability. Taken together, some extracts and active constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> plants can be promising as antiproliferative and chemopreventive agents on which more in vivo studies as well as well-designed clinical trials are crucially needed.
