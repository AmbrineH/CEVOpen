<p class="p">Dried samples of

 <xref rid="B309-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">309</xref>]. The anticancer activities of the various extracts were evaluated in several different human carcinoma cell lines (A549 lung, THP-1 leukemia, DU-145 prostate, IGR-OVI-1 ovary, and MCF-7 breast cancers). The cytotoxic activities of the extracts (100 μg/mL) quantified by sulforhodamine B assay on those cell lines. All extracts produced growth inhibition in THP-1 (76–90%); while hexane and benzene extracts showed cytotoxic effect (&gt;80%) on the growth of all cell lines. It was noted that standard anticancer drugs exhibited 51–67% cytotoxicity in comparison with control groups in the study. Acetone, benzene and hexane extracts inhibited cell cycle 43, 41 and 63%, respectively in A549 cell line and resulted in increased sub-G1 DNA fraction population. The effectiveness of extracts was also studied on Wistar rats having AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity. Accordingly, aqueous, chloroform and ethyl alcohol extracts showed protective effect on liver 65, 71 and 64%, respectively against peroxidative damage. In another study, ethanol extract of fruits of

 <xref rid="B310-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">310</xref>]. Interestingly, the results indicated that treatment by extract selectively induced cell death in carcinoma cells including HCT116 colon, BxPC-3 pancreas and T cell leukemia; however extract was not effective on normal colon epithelial cells. Findings were supported by Annexin V Binding Assay confirming that ethanolic extract induced cell death by caspase-independent apoptosis. As animal models, immunocompromised mice were studied, and administered with ethanolic extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day routinely for 6 weeks. In treatment group, the growth of colon cancer tumors was suppressed without any toxic effect.
