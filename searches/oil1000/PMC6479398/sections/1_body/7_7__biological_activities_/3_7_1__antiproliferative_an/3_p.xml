<p class="p">In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">P. umbellatum</italic> species can be a promising source for anticancer agents. In the study of Iwamoto et al. [
 <xref rid="B311-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">311</xref>], the extraction of milled fresh leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. umbellatum</italic> was prepared by dichloromethane. Total growth inhibition was achieved in several different human carcinoma cell lines (U251, MCF-7, NCI-H460, UACC-62, PC-3, 786-0, NCI-ADR/RES and OVCAR-3) with relatively small effective doses (6.8 and 14.9 µg/mL). As the concentration of total growth inhibition was determined as 144.6 µg/mL for nontumor cell line, cytotoxic effect of dichloromethane extract seem to be selective for tumor cells. In the same study, Balb/C mice with Ehrlich solid tumor were treated with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of the extract by oral route. They found that the sizes of the tumors were reduced 38.7 and 52.2% in 200 and 400 mg/kg extract treatment groups, respectively, without toxicity. Similar effects were also shown by another study in which crude extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. tuberculatum</italic> treated as a test material [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The cytotoxic activity IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the crude extract was found to be 10 μg/mL in SF-295 cells and 4.3 μg/mL in the HCT-8 cell line. Test material was also examined in Balb/C nude mice (100–200 mg/kg/day); as a result, a hollow fiber assay showed that crude extract inhibited cell proliferation in those SF-295 and HCT-8 cell lines by 24.6–54.8%, respectively, without any sign of toxicity.
