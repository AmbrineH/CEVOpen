<p class="p">Piperine was found to be an anticancer agent against osteosarcoma cells including HOS and U2OS cell lines [
 <xref rid="B325-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">325</xref>]. It showed growth inhibitory action in both osteosarcoma cell lines but relatively weaker inhibitory effect in normal hFOB cells. By piperine treatment, the cell population found in G2 phase was enhanced while the cell population in G1 phase was reduced, however, no changes in S phase population were observed. Therefore, piperine exerted its effect by arresting cell cycle at G2/M phase. Additionally, piperine represented its inhibitory properties on cell migration and invasion by increasing the expression of TIMP-1/-2 and by down-regulation of MMP-2/-9.
