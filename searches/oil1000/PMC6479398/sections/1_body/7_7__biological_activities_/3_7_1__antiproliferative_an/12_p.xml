<p class="p">Pro-apoptotic effect of PL treatment was also seen in an experimental design with human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines in concentration dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B339-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">339</xref>]. In this study it was shown that the activation of caspase-3, PARP, JNK-ERK as well as stimulation of ROS accumulation underlies the action mechanism of PL. Furthermore, PL treatment induced p21 expression at protein level resulting cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (KKU-055, KKU-100, KKU-139, KKU-213, and KKU-214). Similar anticancer potency was seen in 5 to 15 Î¼M PL-treated pancreatic, lung, kidney, and breast cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B340-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">340</xref>]. Protein analysis showed that PL suppressed expression of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and Sp-regulated genes containing cyclin D1, survivin, cMyc, EGFR and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (cMet). Apoptosis was shown to be ROS-mediated and both were found to be attenuated after co-treatment with glutathione.
