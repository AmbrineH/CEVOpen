<p class="p">In the study of Yaffe et al. [
 <xref rid="B322-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">322</xref>], piperine treatment on HRT-18 human rectal adenocarcinoma cells inhibited metabolic activity in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis represented that piperine also induced apoptosis. However, in this study it was found that apoptosis induced by piperine was mediated by the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; particularly, hydroxyl radicals. Treatment of cells with
