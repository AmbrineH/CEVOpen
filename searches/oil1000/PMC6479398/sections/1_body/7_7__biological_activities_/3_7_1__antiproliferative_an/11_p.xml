 <italic class="italic">P. methysticum</italic>, also known as kava-kava, is another 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species rich in three kinds of chalcones, namely flavokawain A, B, and C. Among these compounds, FKB has been reported as promising anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and as well as antitumorigenic agent toward several cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B328-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">328</xref>,

 <xref rid="B331-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">331</xref>]. Antitumorigenic effects of FKB were evaluated in both 4T1 cell line and Balb/C mice [
 <xref rid="B332-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">332</xref>]. Cytotoxicity of FKB toward 4T1 cell lines was determined by MTT assay and cell growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, FKB interfered with cell cycle and raised the cell population in the SubG0/G1 phase as compared to control groups. Findings from in vivo study also showed the inhibition of tumor growth in 50 mg/kg FKB treated mice during 28 days. Interestingly, FKB treatment increased CD4/CD3 T-cell and CD8/CD4 T-cell populations significantly resulting in positive effect on immune system of test animals. Apart from that, FKB treatment reduced the cancer formation in another side of body including lung, liver, and spleen significantly while the number of colonies was higher in the non-treated group. Antiangiogenic effect of FKB has been investigated in 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 μg/mL treated HUVEC cell lines [
 <xref rid="B333-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">333</xref>]. Tube-like structures were counted manually and accordingly branch formations were found to be 38.44 ± 3.95 and 25.44 ± 5.69 in 2.5 and 5.0 μg/mL treated groups, respectively. In the same study, zebrafish embryos were subjected to FKB as test model. Up to 5.0 μg/mL FKB treatment, there were no toxicity signals. However, 10 μg/mL inhibited the formation of subintestinal veins and showed toxic effect. Therefore, the best inhibition rate was observed in 2.5 μg/mL FKB-treated group. These reports for promising anticancer activities of FKB provided the inspiration for the synthesis of potentially more effective FKB derivatives. Accordingly, in the study of Abu Bakar et al. [
 <xref rid="B334-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">334</xref>], 23 FKB analogs were synthesized. The cytotoxic effects of these compounds were evaluated in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Five synthetic derivates showed notable cytotoxic activities in MCF-7 cell line (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 5.5–5.9 µg/mL). Piperlongumine, also known as piplartine, is another bioactive component, an amide alkoloid found in the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species, particularly, in 
 <italic class="italic">P. longum.</italic> While it was isolated in 1961 for the first time, its pharmacological properties including neuroprotective, anti-atherosclerotic and antimicrobial, have been elucidated in the past decade [
 <xref rid="B335-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">335</xref>,
 <xref rid="B336-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">336</xref>]. Although there were two in vitro studies showing its potent antiproliferative effects on both prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines in 2013 and 2014, the mechanism based detailed studies for its anticancer properties were published recently. The antiproliferative effects of PL at low micromolar concentrations on LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells was found to be associated with reduction in the protein level of androgen receptor AR, which is key element of oncogenic precursor [
 <xref rid="B337-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">337</xref>]. PL also inhibited cell growth in human ovarian cancer cells with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values in the ranges of 6 to 8 µM in three different cell lines by G2/M cell cycle arrest [
 <xref rid="B338-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">338</xref>]. In those cells, intracellular ROS levels were increased by PL treatment in dose dependent manner which consequently resulted in apoptosis.
