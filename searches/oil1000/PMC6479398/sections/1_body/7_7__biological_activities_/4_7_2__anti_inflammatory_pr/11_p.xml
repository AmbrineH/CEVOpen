 <xref rid="B356-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">356</xref>], one of the active chalcone constituents of kava extracts called flavokawain A (FKA) has been investigated for its anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. Accordingly, FKA pretreatment resulted in reduced production of LPS-induced NO and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels compared to LPS-treated control. Besides, protein and mRNA expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 were also suppressed by FKA treatment in a dose-dependent manner. FKA also inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-kB. Moreover, FKA downregulated LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α at both protein and mRNA level.
