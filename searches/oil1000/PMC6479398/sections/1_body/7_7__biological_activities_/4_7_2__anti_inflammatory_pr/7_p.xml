<p class="p">Recently, Finato et al. [
 <xref rid="B350-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">350</xref>] investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of crude extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. gaudichaudianum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. arboreum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. umbellata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. fuligineum</italic> and, 
 <italic class="italic">Peperomia obtusifolia</italic> in LPS-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cytotoxic concentrations of extracts were determined by MTT assays and IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (mg/mL) values of 0.55, 2.19, 1.56, 0.24, and 2.12 were found for each extract, respectively. These specified doses were treated to cells with and without an inflammatory stimulus; after 24 h incubation, cell-free supernatants were subjected to cytokine analysis. All extract exhibited differential inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 as well as TGF-β1 and TNF-α.
