<p class="p">In the study of Reddy et al. [
 <xref rid="B349-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">349</xref>], the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of a hydroalcoholic extract (70% ethanol and 30% distilled water) of 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> leaves (HEPBL) were demonstrated. Wistar rats and Albino mice were administered different concentrations of HEPBL according to OECD guideline no. 425 to detect non-toxic treatment concentrations. Treatments at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg exhibited significant analgesic properties in both animal groups. Interestingly, HEPBL decreased the pain by both central and peripheral mechanisms. According to literature nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the pain just peripherally, but narcotic analgesics reduce the pain both centrally and peripherally. HEPBL also showed anti-inflammatory effect against the carrageenan induced paw edema model and cotton pellet-induced granuloma model. Compared to control group, HEPBL significantly inhibited the paw edema growth in the 50, 100, 200 mg/kg treatment groups in a dose dependent manner. The most effective dose was shown to be 200 mg/kg with a 79.73% reduction score after 3 h. Similarly, reduction in the dry weights of granuloma was reported as 57.49% in a 200 mg/kg treated group as compared to control groups.
