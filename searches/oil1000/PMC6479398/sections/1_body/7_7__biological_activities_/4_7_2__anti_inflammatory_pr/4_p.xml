 <xref rid="B348-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">348</xref>], investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper crocatum</italic> extracts prepared by maceration technique using 96% ethanol. To screen the toxic effect, murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line was treated with several doses of extract (0–500 μg/mL) and subjected to MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-tetrazolium) assay. In 150 μg/mL, and higher treatment concentrations, cell viability was found to be significantly affected as compared to control groups. TNF-α level was decreased significantly at 50 μg/mL treated cell group while each treatment groups (10, 50 and 75 ug/mL) showed decreased IL-1β levels as compared to control groups. Extract at 10 and 50 μg/mL concentrations exhibited significant reduction in IL-6 levels and the lowest NO level was obtained in the 50 μg/mL treatment group.
