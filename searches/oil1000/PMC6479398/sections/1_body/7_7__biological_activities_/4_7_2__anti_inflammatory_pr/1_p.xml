<p class="p">Inflammation can be considered as a defense mechanism of living organisms to various stimuli involving pathogens, toxic compounds, and many environmental stress factors [
 <xref rid="B343-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">343</xref>]. Normally, this highly regulated and self-limiting phenomenon promotes the healing process. However, uncontrolled and pro-longed process, called as chronic inflammation, may cause sustained activation of immune cells resulted in high amount of cytokine release [

 <xref rid="B345-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">345</xref>]. This persistent response potentially leads to pathological disorders such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, cancer and various neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the basis of inflammation and characterization of novel anti-inflammatory agents may serve promising therapeutic approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.
