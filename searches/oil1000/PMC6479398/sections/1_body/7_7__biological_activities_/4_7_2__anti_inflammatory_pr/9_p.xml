<p class="p">In the study of Ying et al. [
 <xref rid="B352-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">352</xref>], the effects of piperine at non-toxic doses (10, 50 or 100 μg/mL) were investigated in LPS induced RAW264.7 cells. As compared to LPS treatment, piperine reduced the production of PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and NO significantly in dose-dependent manner. Additionally, protein expression levels of COX-2 and inducible NOS were suppressed significantly at 50 or 100 μg/mL, while their mRNA expression levels were decreased at each treatment group. Piperine exhibited the inhibitiory effect on both TNF-α production and its mRNA expression in dose dependent manner. Moreover, piperine treatment caused a significant decrease in the activation of NF-ĸB by suppressing IĸBa phosphorylation and a reduction in the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit.
