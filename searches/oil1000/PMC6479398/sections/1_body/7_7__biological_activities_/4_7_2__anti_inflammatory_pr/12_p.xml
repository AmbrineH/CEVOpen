<p class="p">Another kava component, kavain and its structural analog kava-241 obtained synthetically also investigated for their anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B357-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">357</xref>]. In this study, RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to 100–300 μg/mL of kava and kava-241 after 0.1 μg/mL of LPS stimulation. While kava reduced LPS-induced TNF-α production by 75%, kava-241 resulted in a more prominent inhibition (85%) on the same parameter as compared to control group. Moreover, kava-241 showed less cytotoxic effect than kava. In vivo studies demonstrated that in the periodontitis model of DBA1/BO male mice, 40 mg/kg kava-241 administration resulted in reduction of epithelial downgrowth (72%) and alveolar bone loss (36%) as compared to untreated-control groups. In the study of Huck et al. [
 <xref rid="B358-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">358</xref>], kava-241 was found to be effective against 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>-induced joint inflammation in a murine arthritis model. In the mentioned study, animals were treated with 50 μg/100 µL of 
 <italic class="italic">P. gingivalis</italic>-LPS and 600 µL of kava-241 (40 mg/kg) for 17 days. Kava-241 treatment reduced the size of inflammatory cells and osteoctlasts in the side of inflammation. Moreover, Kava-241 inhibited the TNF-α production and TLRs protein expressions through the suppression of activation of ERK, MAPK, AKT and p38 proteins. Collectively, these studies support claims that 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> plants are potential candidates for treatment of inflammation-based diseases.
