<p class="p">In addition to 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> extracts, bioactive components of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> plants were also evaluated in terms of their anti-inflammatory activities. In the study of Umar et al. [
 <xref rid="B351-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">351</xref>], piperine exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in collagen-induced arthritis model of Wistar rats that were administered with 100 mg/kg of piperine for 21 days. Effectiveness of piperine on production of inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10 and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) were assessed by ELISA and by Griess assay for measurement of NO. Piperine treatment reduced the NO production in piperine group as compared to control group. Moreover, administration of piperine inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-1β, TNF-α and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, but increased the level of IL-10.
