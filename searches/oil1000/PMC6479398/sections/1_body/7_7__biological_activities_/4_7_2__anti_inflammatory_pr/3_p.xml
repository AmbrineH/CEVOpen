<p class="p">To elucidate the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> ethanolic extract (PNE) on airway inflammation model, Balb/C mice were induced with ovalbumin (OVA) and administered orally with 200 mg/kg PNE [
 <xref rid="B347-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">347</xref>]. PNE decreased the size of inflammation related cells such as eosinophils, goblet, and mast cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Although OVA induced the cytokine productions, PNE regulated balance of T cells responses by decreasing IL-1β, IL-4, IL-17A, and TNF-α cytokine levels in both BALF and lung homogenate. Thus, PNE demonstrated significant potency on inhibition of inflammation.
