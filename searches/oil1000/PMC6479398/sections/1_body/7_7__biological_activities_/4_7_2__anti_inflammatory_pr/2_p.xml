 <xref rid="B346-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">346</xref>], ethanol and hexane extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> and one of its bioactive compound, piperine, were shown to be effective against carrageenan induced-paw edema in Swiss albino mice. Piperine treatment inhibited edema growth at all doses (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg). While the hexane extract was effective at 5 and 10 mg/kg treatment groups, the best inhibition score was obtained at 10 mg/kg treated group for 60 min. The ethanol extract also exhibited good inhibition profile at 10 mg/kg treatment group as compared to control groups. However, all inhibition scores were less than the standard drug, diclofenac sodium.
