<p class="p">A standardized dichloromethane extract (SDE) of 
 <italic class="italic">P. umbellatum</italic> leaves exhibited anti-inflammatory activity on carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis models [
 <xref rid="B311-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">311</xref>]. Balb/C mice were administered with carrageenan solution (2.5 mg/mL, 40 ÂµL/animal) to induce inflammation, and after one hour 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of SDE were treated. The paw volume was measured at certain intervals. SDE treatment demonstrated inhibitory effect on paw edema during first phase (24 h) without toxicity. Interestingly, increased leukocytes migration promoted second phase of inflammation. However, all concentrations of SDE inhibited inflammation at 48 h. Taken together, 
 <italic class="italic">P. umbellatum</italic> SDE might be promising anti-inflammatory agent.
