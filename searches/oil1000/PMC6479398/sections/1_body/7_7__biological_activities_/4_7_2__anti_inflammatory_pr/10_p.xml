 <xref rid="B353-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">353</xref>]. Barrier protective effects of PL (between 5–40 µM doses) have been investigated by measuring endothelial cell permeability, migration and monocyte adhesion assays as well as by measuring the activation of proinflammatory proteins in LPS-induced HUVEC cells and in mice. PL reduced the migration of monocyte cells to HUVECs, expression of CAMs (cell adhesion molecules) thus demonstrated a protective effect against LPS-stimulated disruption of endothelial barrier. It was also demonstrated that PL inhibited LPS-induced production of IL-6 and TNF-α through inhibiting the activation of NF-ĸB and ERK 1/2 by LPS.
