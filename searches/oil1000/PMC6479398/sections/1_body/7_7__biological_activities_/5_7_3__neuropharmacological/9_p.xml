<p class="p">Previous studies showed that piperine produces antidepressant-like effects through the inhibition of enzymatic activity of monoamine oxidase and increasing the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in various mouse models of behavioral despair [

Two studies from the same research group also reported that intraperitoneal administration of piperine to mice caused a significant reduction in immobility time, an important parameter of serotonergic system, assessed by forced swim and tail suspension tests [

 <xref rid="B379-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">379</xref>]. To clarify the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the antidepressant-like action of piperine Mao et al. [
 <xref rid="B380-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">380</xref>] examined the effect of piperine treatment on depressive-like behavior and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). 10 mg/kg chronic treatment of piperine significantly attenuated behavioral deficits in CUMS mice evaluated by forced swimming and sucrose preference tests. In mechanism-based studies, piperine treatment significantly increased the expression level of BDNF protein in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of both na√Øve and CUMS mice. The antidepressant-like effects of piperine in CUMS mice were significantly blocked by the injection of K252a, an inhibitor of BDNF receptor (TrkB), suggesting that ameliorative potential of piperine are mostly related with its capacity to increase the BDNF level. In a different study Mao et al. [
 <xref rid="B380-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">380</xref>], it was also reported that corticosterone-induced depression like behavior of model mice can be successfully suppressed by pretreating animals with piperine (at 5 and 10 mg/kg) for 21 days as assessed by diminished sucrose consumption which was found to be related with the elevated expression level of BDNF protein in the hippocampus. Regarding all these findings, it may be inferred that piperine exerts its antidepressant-like effect through modulating BDNF signaling.
