<p class="p">Piperine also exhibited strong anti-neuroinflamatory effect on LPS induced BV2 microglia cell line [
 <xref rid="B388-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">388</xref>]. In this study, it was showed that piperine significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and PGE 2 production in BV2 cells through inhibition of NF-κB and activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Recently, it has been suggested that chronic neuro-inflammation may lead to pathological amyloid β (Aβ) and τ accumulations in late-onset AD [
 <xref rid="B389-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">389</xref>] which can be modelled in animals by intracerebroventricul-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) treatment [
 <xref rid="B390-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">390</xref>]. Recently it has been shown that piperine has relatively selective effects on cognition in the ICV-STZ animal model and it causes improved hippocampal function prior to significant Aβ deposition [
 <xref rid="B390-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">390</xref>]. Accordingly, it was reported that the cognitive-enhancing effect induced by piperine at a relevant dose was simultaneous with hippocampal malonaldehyde decrement and the redox balance. In addition, histopathological outcomes were in accordance with the neuroprotective properties of piperine.
