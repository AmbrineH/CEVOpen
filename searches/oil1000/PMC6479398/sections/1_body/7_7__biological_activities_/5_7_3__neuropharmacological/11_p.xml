 <xref rid="B386-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">386</xref>] reported that piperine elicits a cytoprotective activity in rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells, primary rat cortical neurons and in mouse models by inducing phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and restoring the imbalance between autophagy and apoptosis. In SK-N-SH cells and primary neurons, piperine caused elevated cell viability and maintaining of mitochondrial functioning. Four week piperine administration (at two different doses; 25 and 50 mg/kg) ameliorated rotenone-induced disruption of motor functions and saved the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of PD mice models. In addition, it was reported that the rate of autophagy elevated by suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1) and activation of PP2A. A similar mechanism of action for piperine was also demonstrated in rat models. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B387-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">387</xref>] showed that apoptosis was diminished in the presence of piperine, however, autophagy was stimulated therefore abolishing neuronal injury in the rotenone-induced rat model of PD. Two important results represented by both rat and mice models of PD in above-mentioned studies suggest a novel understanding for the neuroprotective action mechanism of piperine in the treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.
