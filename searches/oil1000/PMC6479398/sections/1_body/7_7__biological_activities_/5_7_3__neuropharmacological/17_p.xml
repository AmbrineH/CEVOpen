<p class="p">Long standing neuropharmacological activities of 
 <italic class="italic">P. methysticum</italic> including anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, mild anaesthetic and analgesic effects can be mostly attributable to kavalactones, particularly yangonin, kawain, dihydrokawain and methysticin, found in the lipid soluble fractions of the extracts [
 <xref rid="B402-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">402</xref>]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have elucidated possible biological action mechanisms of kavalactones including blockade of voltage-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, enhanced ligand binding to Î³-aminobutyric acid A (GABA
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>) receptors, reduced neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and dopamine, as well as weak inhibitory action on monoamine oxidase-B. Recently, Fragoulis et al. [
 <xref rid="B403-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">403</xref>] reported that methysticin administration activates the Nrf2 pathway and reduces neuroinflammation, hippocampal oxidative damage and memory loss in transgenic mouse model of AD.
