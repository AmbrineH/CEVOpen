<p class="p">In another study, the methanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> was analyzed for its memory-enhancing and antioxidant properties in AD models of rats which were experimentally induced by amyloid beta (1â€“42) [
 <xref rid="B375-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">375</xref>]. Rats were administered with extract at 50 and 100 mg/kg doses orally for 21 days. The memory-enhancing effects of the plant extract were studied by Y-maze and radial arm-maze tasks approaches. The antioxidant activities of the extract in the hippocampus were assessed by using superoxide dismutase-, catalase-, glutathione peroxidase-specific enzymatic assays and the total content of reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl levels. Significant reduction in spontaneous alternations percentage within Y-maze task and increase of working memory and reference memory errors within radial arm-maze task were reported for AD group. However, treatment with the plant extract significantly ameliorated memory performance and showed remarkable antioxidant prospect.
