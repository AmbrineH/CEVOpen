<p class="p">There is also some evidence to suggest that piperlongumine can be an efficient strategy to improve cognitive functions. In recent studies, piperlongumine has been reported to increase cognitive function in a transgenic mouse model of AD as well as hippocampal activities and cognitive dysfunction of aged mice [

 <xref rid="B401-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">401</xref>]. In the hippocampus region of the aged mice, piperlongumine resulted in substantial elevation in the levels of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (caMKIIÎ±) and ERK1/2. Furthermore, following piperlongumine treatment in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus the level of neurogenesis was significantly potentiated which was assessed by counting doublecortin-positive cells [
