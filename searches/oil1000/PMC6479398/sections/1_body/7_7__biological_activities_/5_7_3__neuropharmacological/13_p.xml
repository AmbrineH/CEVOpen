<p class="p">Taking all the abovementioned studies together, it can be concluded that piperine possesses profound effects on neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS such as AD and PD. However, the oral delivery of piperine to the brain is hampered due to many pharmaceutical challenges such as low water solubility, extensive first-pass metabolism and low absolute oral bioavailability [

Recently, the use of brain-targeted nanosystems has been extensively investigated to improve delivery characteristics of challenging lipophilic active compounds. Studies have shown that piperine encapsulation can be achieved using different solid lipid nanoparticles and results have indicated that piperine-loaded nanoparticles remarkably reduce the severity of neurodegenerative diseases modelled by experimental animals [

 <xref rid="B393-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">393</xref>], piperine-loaded oral microemulsion as a nanosystem increased piperine efficacy and enhanced its delivery to the brain resulting in better therapeutic outcome compared to the free drug in male Wistar rats exposed to ICV-colchicine injection to induce sporadic dementia of Alzheimerâ€™s type. In another recent study by Anissian et al. [
