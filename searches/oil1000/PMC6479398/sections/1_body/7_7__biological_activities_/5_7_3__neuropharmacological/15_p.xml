<p class="p">There are also some in vitro and animal studies showing neuroprotective effects of piperlongumine and its analogs in case of neurodegeneration. In the study of Peng et al. [
 <xref rid="B399-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">399</xref>], two synthetic analogs of piperlongumine elicited low cytotoxicity and potent protection in hydrogen peroxide- and 6-hydroxydopamine-stimulated cell damage in the neuron-like PC12 cells via increasing the cellular levels of some antioxidant molecules. In rotenone-induced PD mouse models, Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B390-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">390</xref>] showed that four week piperlongumine (2 and 4 mg/kg) administration attenuated motor deficits and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. In the same study, it was also indicated that piperlongumine improved cell viability and enhanced mitochondrial function in primary neurons and SK-N-SH cells through inhibition of apoptosis and induction of autophagy. Therefore, we can note that similar to piperine, piperlongumine also exerts its neuroprotective effects on PD by setting the disrupted balance between two key parameters namely, apoptosis and autophagy.
