 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> (black pepper) is among the most extensively studied species for its neuropharmacological activities. Anxiolytic, antidepressant, neuroprotective and antineuro-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> extracts have been examined in multiple animal studies. The methanolic extract prepared from the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> was investigated in management of AD stimulated by neuroinflammation in the rat model [
 <xref rid="B374-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">374</xref>]. In this study, aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) at 17 mg/kg b.w was used orally for one month to induce an AD model. Thereafter, animals in the group of AD were divided randomly into subgroups such as AD control; positive control (orally administered with a conventional drug-rivastigmine) and extract group (orally administerd with 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> extract). Postmortem brains of the animal were examined for several parameters such as levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), acetylcholine, C-reactive protein (CRP) and NF-ÎºB. Administration of AD rats with 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> extract resulted in substantial improvements in the above-mentioned parameters which suggest that it may have potent anti-neuroinflammatory effects and may be promising in the treatment of AD.
