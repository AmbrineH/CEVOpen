 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> in a β-amyloid (1-42) rat model of AD. The mentioned effects of the extract were evaluated by numbers of open-arm entries, forced swimming tests and the time spent in open arms. In the Aβ (1-42)-treated AD models of rats, the number of open-arm entries together with percentage of the time spent in the open arms were significantly decreased which indicated that the Aβ (1-42)-treated rats experienced high levels of anxiety and they represented an efficient model to show the anxiolytic effects of extract. Accordingly, the administration of the methanolic extract increased the time spent in the open arms of Aβ (1-42)-treated rats significantly. The number of open-arm entries for Aβ (1-42)-and methanolic extract-treated rats increased as compared to the Aβ (1-42) treated group. The forced swimming test is one of the validated tools for predicting the antidepressant properties of drugs [
 <xref rid="B376-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">376</xref>]. Regarding this, the swimming time significantly increased in the Aβ (1-42)- and methanolic extract-treated group as compared to the Aβ (1-42)-treated group. Taken together, results demonstrated that treatment with the methanolic extract elicited a marked anxiolytic and antidepressant effects.
