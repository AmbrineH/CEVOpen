<p class="p">Piperlongumine (PL), an alkaloid amide, is the major active constituents of long pepper (
 <italic class="italic">P. longum</italic>). Piperlongumine has previously shown to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities [

 <xref rid="B396-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">396</xref>]. Recent studies also showed that piperlongumine possess highly potent anti-neuroinflammatory functions. In vitro studies showed that piperlongumine significantly attenuated the production of proinflammatory mediators (NO and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and some cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) by suppressing NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS induced BV-2 microglias, primary astrocytes, RAW264.7 macrophages and Jurkat cells [

 <xref rid="B398-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">398</xref>]. Some important insights into the anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects of piperlongumine have come from recent studies using animal models. Accordingly, piperlongumine inhibited LPS-induced memory impairment, Aβ accumulation and the activities of β- and γ-secretases in murine models [

 <xref rid="B398-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">398</xref>], reported that the paralytic severity and neuropathology in mice model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55 immunization were reduced in piperlongumine-treated group in comparison with the EAE model group.
