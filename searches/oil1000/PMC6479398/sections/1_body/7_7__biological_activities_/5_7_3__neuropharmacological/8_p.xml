<p class="p">There are important specialized phytoactives found in 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species such as flavanones, chalcones, dihydrochalcones, and alkaloids as mentioned before. Piperine (1-piperoylpiperidine), a nitrogenous pungent alkaloid, is one of the major functionally active constituents responsible from neuropharmacological activities of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum.</italic> The neuroprotective, anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-depressant effects of piperine have been elucidated in multiple animal studies. In 6-hydroxydopamie (6-OHDA)-induced PD model of Wistar rats, Shrivastava et al. [
 <xref rid="B366-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">366</xref>], reported that piperine treatment reduced neuronal cell apoptosis at a remarkable rate through inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation and pro-apoptotic Bax levels as well as through the elevation of Bcl-2 levels. Furthermore, it was shown that piperine treatment reduced cytochrome-c release from mitochondria and diminished caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation induced by 6-OHDA. Treatment with piperine also caused a marked reduction of 6-OHDA-induced lipid peroxidation and stimulation of GSH levels in striatum brain region of rats. In this study, piperine also reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines namely, TNF-α and IL-1β, in 6-OHDA-induced PD model of rats. Therefore, this study suggests that piperine has highly potent neuroprotective effect through its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as wells as anti-apoptotic mechanism of action in 6-OHDA induced PD models.
