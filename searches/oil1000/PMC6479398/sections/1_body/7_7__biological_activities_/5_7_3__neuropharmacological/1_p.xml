<p class="p">Uncontrolled systemic inflammation may proceed into a persistent chronic state that may have neurological impacts in the development of many neurodegenerative disorders including PD and AD [
 <xref rid="B359-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">359</xref>]. Recent studies showed that therapeutic compounds acting on single targets (e.g., acetylcholinestaerase inhibitors) often show insufficient efficacy and undesirable toxic effects in the treatment of neuroinflammatory CNS disorders [
 <xref rid="B360-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">360</xref>]. Studies suggest that balanced modulation of several interconnected targets can be more efficient strategy than the single target modulation for treating complex neuroinflammatory disorders with multi-factorial nature [
