 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> (PS) is one of the edible, terrestrial species of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> plants, abundantly found around the Asian regions. Traditionally, it has been extensively used for the treatment of various CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression and memory dysfunctions. Previous studies reported that 
 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> has anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-acetylcholinesterase activities [

 <xref rid="B364-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">364</xref>], in vitro cytoprotective properties of different extracts from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> against Aβ-induced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity were investigated. Inhibitory effects of four extracts ethyl acetate (LEA), hexane (LHXN), dichloromethane (LDCM) and methanol (LMEOH) on Aβ-induced production and mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory factors in BV-2 microglial cells were assessed. Additionally, the protective effects of extracts on human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were also evaluated by using Aβ-induced conditioned media from microglia cells. The LEA and LMEOH extracts resulted in reduction in the secretion levels of Aβ-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) by downregulating the mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BV-2 cells. LEA and LMEOH pre-treated conditioned media from microglia cells elicited protection on human neuroblastoma cell line against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity through downregulation of phosphorylated tau proteins. The results of this in vitro study suggest that polar extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> leaves could be a promising complementary alternative in the treatment of AD.
