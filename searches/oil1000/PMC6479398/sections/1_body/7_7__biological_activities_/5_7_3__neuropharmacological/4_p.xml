<p class="p">Functional properties of 
 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> as antidepressant were exhibited in rodent animal model by means of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation [

 <xref rid="B373-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">373</xref>] these properties of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> extract and its ethyl acetate fraction (PSY) were investigated by using several parameters including forced swimming test, open field test, and tail suspension test in mice. The results showed that treatment of mice with either 
 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> extracts at 100 and 200 mg/kg or PSY at 12.5â€“50 mg/kg doses resulted in potent antidepressant effects, which is similar to response obtained by 20 mg/kg conventional therapeutic drug fluoxetine. Moreover, PSY increased the level of BDNF protein as well as phosphorylation levels of CREB and ERK proteins in the hippocampus of rats suggesting that 
 <italic class="italic">P. sarmentosum</italic> can modulate the physiology of brain cells.
