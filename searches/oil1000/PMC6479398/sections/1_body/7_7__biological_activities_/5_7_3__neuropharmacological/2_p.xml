 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> is an abundantly found 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species in certain regions of the world, particularly tropical areas. Ferreres et al. [
 <xref rid="B363-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">363</xref>], investigated the phenolic profiles and anti-cholinesterase activity of both aqueous and ethanol extracts of leaves. Regarding chemical composition, hydroxychavicol was identified as a major phytochemical in both extracts. Both extracts demonstrated potent inhibitory efficacy against acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes. In this study, the effects of extracts on the viability of neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y) were also evaluated at the mitochondrial function (MTT reduction) and membrane integrity (LDH release) levels. Accordingly, ethanol extract between 7.8–1000 μg/mL concentrations did not result in an alteration in the membrane integrity or the function of mitochondria. However, the aqueous extract at 125 µg/mL reduced the cell viability about 20% and interfered with the mitochondrial function. For this extract, more significant reductions in cell viability were reported above 500 μg/mL concentrations which were shown to be cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells (human). The results of this study suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> leaf extracts could be promising for the prevention/treatment of neurodegenerative disease.
