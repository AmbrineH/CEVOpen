<p class="p">Piperine treatment at 10 mg/kg also exerted a neuroprotective effects against a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD [
 <xref rid="B381-molecules-24-01364" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">381</xref>]. Accordingly, piperine treatment ameliorated the MPTP-induced disruptive effects in motor coordination and in cognition-related functions. It also reversed MPTP-induced decreases in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the brain region of substantia nigra. In addition, piperine diminished the number of activated microglia and reduced the IL-1Î² expression and oxidative stress. Piperine also demonstrated an anti-apoptotic mechanism of action by restoring the imbalance between Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. The results of this study may suggest that piperine can be a promising therapeutic treatment alternative for PD due to its potent neuroprotective activities on dopaminergic neurons by means of anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action.
