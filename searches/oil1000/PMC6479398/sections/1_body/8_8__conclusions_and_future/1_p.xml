<p class="p">Pepper is called the “King of Spices” in the food industry, where it is used to enhance the flavor and texture of foods. Its characteristic aroma depends on its chemical composition. Some 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species have a simple profile, while others, such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. betle</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. auritum</italic>, contain very diverse suites of secondary metabolites. The phytochemicals present in 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species are responsible for their use in traditional medicine to treat several diseases worldwide. In this work, we summarize the usage of 106 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species that possess medicinal values and are used in traditional medicine in various parts of the tropical and subtropical regions.
