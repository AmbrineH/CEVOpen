<p id="Par18" class="p">In the present study, we hypothesized that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens larvae</italic> as a dietary protein source would change the bacterial community and its metabolites, and that these alterations can modulate the immune response in pigs. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens larvae</italic> as a dietary protein source on the microbiota, microbial fermentation profile, and mucosal immune responses in the colon of finishing pigs.
