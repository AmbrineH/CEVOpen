<p id="Par17" class="p">As the first of innate immune response, the gastrointestinal epithelium represents a physical and an immunological barrier, and plays a significant role in maintenance and regulation of gastrointestinal health. Alteration of the bacterial community and their metabolite profile could affect intestinal immune function. Accumulating evidence has indicated that bacterial products resulting from carbohydrate fermentation, such as SCFAs exert many beneficial effects on physiological function of the intestine as they not only provide energy for epithelial cells, stimulate epithelial proliferation and tight junction formation, but also inhibit potential pathogen growth, inflammation and genotoxicity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>], while bacterial metabolites from protein fermentation, such as amines, ammonia, indolic and phenolic compounds are considered to exert negative effects on the intestinal mucosa by interfering with its inflammatory responses [
