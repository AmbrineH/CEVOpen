<p id="Par15" class="p">The global population will exceed 9 billion in 2050, so the demand for meat is expected to be 58% higher in 2050 than its 2010 level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. In parallel, this affects the demand for livestock feeds, and places heavy pressure on the already overexploited resources, especially protein sources. Therefore, more and more researchers are interested in finding new alternative and sustainable protein sources for livestock feed. Several insect species, such as the 
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic>, as a sustainable food alternative and the feed ingredients are an interesting natural resource when considering their many environmental and health benefits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae provide a high nutritive value feedstuff as they are rich in protein (40â€“44%) with a similar or even more balanced amino acid (AA) composition than soybean meal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. As the feed ingredients of a complete diet, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae have been found to modulate growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood profiles of chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Additionally, dietary including 4% and 8% 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae in weaning piglets had no negative effects on the growth performance and nutrient digestibility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Thus, these results demonstrate that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae can be used in the diet of monogastric animals as a potential valuable feed ingredient.
