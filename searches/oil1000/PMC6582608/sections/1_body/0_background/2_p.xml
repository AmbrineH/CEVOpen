<p id="Par16" class="p">In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae also contain bacteriostatic substances, such as chitin, which is a naturally occurring polysaccharide of the arthropodâ€™s exoskeleton and considered to be one of the most abundant biopolymers in nature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Chitin resists the digestion and absorption in the small intestine of monogastric animals, and enters the large intestine for use by the microbiota as a fermentable substrate. A previous study in piglets indicated that chitin derivatives (such as chitosan) administered can potentially reduce or inhibit the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria causing post weaning diarrhea [
