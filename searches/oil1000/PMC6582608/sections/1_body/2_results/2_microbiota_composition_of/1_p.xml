<p id="Par33" class="p">The microbial composition of the colonic digesta following the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae treatment was revealed by 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. In the present study, a total of 1,031,156 V3-V4 16S rRNA effective sequences from the 24 samples, with an average 42,954 sequences per sample, were used for subsequent analysis. The flattened rarefaction curves showed that the sampling in each group provided sufficient OTU coverage (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>: Figure S1). No significant differences in species richness (as reflected by the ACE and Chao1 indices) or diversity (as reflected by Shannon and Simpson indices) were observed in the colonic digesta bacteria at the taxonomic level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). However, the PCoA with the Bray−Curtis distance results showed that the H1 group was separated from the control group (Fig.
