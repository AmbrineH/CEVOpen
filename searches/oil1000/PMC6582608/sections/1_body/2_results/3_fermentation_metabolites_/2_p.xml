<p id="Par39" class="p">Biogenic amines and ammonia are produced from bacterial decarboxylation and deamination of amino acids, respectively. For biogenic amines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a), cadaverine, putrescine, and tryptamine were the major biogenic amines in the colonic digesta. The concentrations of total amines, cadaverine, and tryptamine decreased significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in pigs fed the H1 diet compared with the control diet, as well as the concentration of total amines decreased (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with the H2 diet. However, the concentrations of putrescine, spermine, methylamine, tyramine, and spermidine were not affected by the different dietary treatments (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The dietary treatments also did not affect the ammonia concentration (Fig.
