<p id="Par40" class="p">Phenol and indole compounds are derived from metabolism of aromatic amino acids by intestinal bacteria. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c, the H1 and H2 diets significantly decreased (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) the concentrations of phenol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol, and skatole compared with the control diet. However, the concentration of indole was not affected by the different dietary treatments (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Overall, these results indicate that a diet including 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae markedly increased the concentrations of SCFAs (total SCFAs, butyrate, and isobutyrate), but decreased the concentrations of biogenic amines as well as phenol and indole compounds in the colonic digesta, suggesting a strong impact of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae on carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism characteristics in the colon.
