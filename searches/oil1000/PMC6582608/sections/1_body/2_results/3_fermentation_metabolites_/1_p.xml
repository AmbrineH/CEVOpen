<p id="Par38" class="p">To explore whether feeding 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae affects the fermentation profile of the colonic digesta, some microbial metabolites were determined. For SCFAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b), the concentrations of total SCFAs, butyrate, and isobutyrate increased significantly in pigs fed the H1 diet (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with the control diet. The concentration of butyrate also increased (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in response to the H2 diet compared with the control diet. However, the dietary treatment did not affect the acetate, propionate, branch-chain fatty acid (BCFA), valerate, or isovalerate concentrations (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The concentration of lactate in the colonic digesta was not affected by the dietary treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a).
