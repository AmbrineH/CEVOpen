<p id="Par53" class="p">In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that dietary supplementation with 4% 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae meal significantly altered colonic microbial composition, metabolic profiles, and immune status of finishing pigs, likely toward a host-friendly gut environment. Colonic bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> and several butyrate-producing bacteria were increased after 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae supplementation, whereas the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> was decreased. Intestinal metabolism was altered by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae, as evidenced by the increase in the concentrations of SCFAs, and the decrease in the concentrations of metabolites involved in amino-acid metabolism. The colonic mucosal mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">TLR-4</italic> and pro-inflammatory cytokines were decreased, while the expression of anti-inflammatory and intestinal barrier genes were increased. Furthermore, the changes in the microbiota composition and metabolites concentrations were associated with the alterations in the colonic mucosal immune homeostasis and barrier function. These findings provide a new perspective on insect meal as a sustainable protein source rich in nutrients for swine feed.
