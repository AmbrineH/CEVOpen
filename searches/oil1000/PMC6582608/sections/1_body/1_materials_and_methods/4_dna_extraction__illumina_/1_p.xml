<p id="Par24" class="p">Total genomic DNA in the colonic digesta was extracted using the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentrations of all samples were quantified with the Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). The V3-V4 regions of all bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the 338F universal forward primer (5′-ACTCCTRCGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and the 806R universal reverse primer (5′-GGACTACCVGGGTATCTAAT-3′) [

The PCR products were purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar concentrations from each sample and paired-end sequenced (2 × 250) on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Majorbio, Shanghai, China) according to standard protocols [
