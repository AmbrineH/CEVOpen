<p id="Par31" class="p">The bacterial gene copy, metabolite concentration (lactate, SCFAs, ammonia, amines, and phenol and indole compounds), and gene expression data that were normally distributed were analyzed by One-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test. Data are expressed as means ± standard error of mean (SEM), and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> ≤ 0.05 was regarded as significant. Correlations between mucosal gene expression and significantly changed bacterial abundances (at the genus level and qPCR, 
 <italic class="italic">q</italic> &lt; 0.05) and fermentation end-products by dietary treatment were analyzed by Spearman’s correlation analysis using GraphPad Prim version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A correlation was considered significant when the absolute Spearman’s correlation coefficient was &gt; 0.5 and significant at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05.
