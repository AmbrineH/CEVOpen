<p id="Par29" class="p">Total RNA was extracted from the colonic mucosa with the TRIzol reagent (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA quality of every sample was quantified by Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wiington, DE, USA), and the ratio (OD
 <sub class="sub">260</sub>: OD
 <sub class="sub">280</sub>) ranged from 1.8 to 2.0. Thereafter, 1 μg total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a Synthesis Kit (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used for selected genes were presented in Additional file

Real-time PCR of the target genes and β-actin was performed on CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with TB Green™ Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The reaction mixtures and real-time PCR conditions were set according to a previous study [
