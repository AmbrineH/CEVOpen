<p id="Par23" class="p">Colonic SCFAs concentrations were determined by gas chromatography (GC) according to a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Lactate concentration in the colonic digesta was measured using a commercial assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Biological Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ammonia concentration in the colonic digesta was measured using UV spectrophotometer according to a previous method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. The biogenic amines concentrations in the colonic digesta were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with precolumn dansylation according to a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. The concentrations of phenolic and indolic compounds were analyzed by HPLC, as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>], with slight modifications. Briefly, 0.1 g of the colonic digesta was mixed with 1.0 mL acetonitrile. The mixture was vortexed and stored at − 20 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 3,000×
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and then analyzed on a Waters Alliance system (Alliance HPLC System e2695 separation module; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with a multi λ fluorescence detector (Waters 2475). Gradient elution of two mobile phases was used: mobile phase A consisted of HPLC grade water, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. The gradient program was: 82% A initially, 55% A at 12 min, 10% A at 22 min, and 100% B at 23 min. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and column temperature was 30 °C.
