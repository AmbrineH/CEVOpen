<p id="Par20" class="p">A total of 72 crossbred (Duroc × Landrace × Large White) female pigs were randomly allocated to three different experimental diets based on their body weights (BW, 76.0 ± 0.52 kg). Pigs in the three treatments received increasing levels of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae meal (0, 4% and 8%; Control, H1, and H2 group, respectively). Each treatment consisted of eight pens (replicates), with three pigs per pen. All of the experimental diets were formulated to meet or exceed the nutrient recommendations of the National Research Council (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. All pigs were provided the diet and water ad libitum during the 46-day experiment. The feed consumption per pen was recorded every day to calculate average daily feed intake (ADFI). The BWs of all pigs were recorded at the beginning and the end of the study period to determine average daily gain (ADG).
