 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae markedly impacted the nitrogen metabolic profiles. For biogenic amines, cadaverine and putrescine are the most abundant amines and are formed from decarboxylation of lysine, arginine and ornithine, respectively [

 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae markedly decreased the concentrations of total amines and cadaverine compared with the control group, suggesting decreased microbial amino acid decarboxylation, which may be attributed to a decrease in the abundance of amines-producing bacteria in the colon. Our correlation analysis showed that the decreases in total amines and cadaverine were positively correalted with the decreased abundance of
