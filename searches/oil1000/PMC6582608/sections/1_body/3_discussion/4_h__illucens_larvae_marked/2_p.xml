<p id="Par50" class="p">On the other hand, administering 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae also altered the aromatic amino acid metabolism by bacteria in the colon. Tryptophan, an aromatic amino acid, can be decarboxylated into tryptamine by gut bacteria [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. In the present study, diet including 4% 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae decreased the tryptamine concentration in the colonic digesta. Tryptamine induces serotonin secretion by enterochromaffin cells and subsequently regulates intestinal motility and platelet function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Therefore, the decrease in tryptamine may affect intestinal function. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae also reduced the concentrations of phenol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol, and skatole, indicating that bacterial fermentation of tryptophan and tyrosine decreased. Phenol and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol are produced from tyrosine catabolism by gut bacteria, while skatole is derived from tryptophan catabolism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], and are regarded as co-carcinogens and colon cancer promoter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Thus, the decrease in the concentrations of phenolic and indolic compounds in the current study indicates that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae may have a beneficial effect on gut health. In general, together with the increase in SCFAs, our findings clearly indicate an evident change in microbial metabolic activity, with higher microbial carbohydrate fermentation and lower microbial catabolism of amino acids after the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae treatment.
