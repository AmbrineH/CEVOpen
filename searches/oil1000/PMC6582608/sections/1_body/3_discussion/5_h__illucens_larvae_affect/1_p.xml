<p id="Par51" class="p">The change of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites could affect intestinal immunity of host. In the current study, diet including 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae (especially supplementation with 4% group) down-regulated mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">TLR4</italic> and pro-inflammatory cytokines 
 <italic class="italic">IFN-γ</italic>, while up-regulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines 
 <italic class="italic">IL-10</italic> in the colonic mucosa. As the novel receptors, TLR can mediate innate immune responses, recognize microbiota and their products and then initiate pro-inflammatory pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Some species of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>] and their products (amines, indolic and phenolic compounds) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] can trigger intestinal inflammation through 
 <italic class="italic">TLR4</italic> signaling pathways, while SCFAs-producing bacteria and SCFAs can down-regulate the pro-inflammatory responses through 
 <italic class="italic">TLR4-NFkB</italic> signaling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. In particular, the correlation analysis also revealed that the down-regulation in the expressions of 
 <italic class="italic">TLR4</italic> and pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 <italic class="italic">IFN-γ</italic>) positively correlated with the decreased abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> and the concentrations of total amines, cadaverine, and phenol, while negatively correlated with the increase in butyrate-producing bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">Psedobutyrivibrio</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa) and the concentrations total SCFA, and butyrate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Thus, the down-regulation gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines while up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine after the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae treatment may be attributed to enrichments of some butyrate-producing bacteria and SCFAs concentrations, and the depression of potential pathogen (
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic>) abundance and several toxic compounds concentrations.
