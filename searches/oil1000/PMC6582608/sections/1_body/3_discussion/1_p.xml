 <italic class="italic">H. illucens larvae</italic> are a novel source of dietary protein that have been used widely in the diets of animals, such as broiler chickens, laying hens, and weaning piglets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. The present study, used 16S rRNA Miseq sequencing and biochemical analyses, for the first time to identify the changes in the microbiota and metabolites of the colonic digesta and mucosal immune genes expression in finishing pigs in response to administration of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae. Our results showed that dietary supplementation with 4% 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae dramatically increased the abundance and numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> and some butyrate-producing bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium</italic>), SCFAs concentrations, anti-inflammatory cytokine, and intestinal barrier genes expression in the colon, but decreased the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic>, the concentrations of nitrogenous fermentation products (cadaverine, tryptamine, phenol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol, and skatole), and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes expression. The changes in the colonic mucosal gene expression were associated with changes in bacterial composition and their metabolites (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). These findings suggest that feeding low levels (about 4%) of 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae in the diet may act as a potential prebiotic for finishing pigs.
