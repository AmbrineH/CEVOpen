<p id="Par46" class="p">Until now, the exact mechanism for the change in the colonic microbiota by 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae has remained unclear. 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae contain chitin (about 4.65% in the present study), which serves as a substrate for gut microbiota and then alters their composition. Previous studies have indicated that low-level chitin restores the compositional balance in the microbial communities of humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>] or mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae also have a high concentration of the medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) lauric acid (C12:0, about 28% of total fatty acids in the present study, unpublished data), which is a natural antimicrobial agent and particularly active against Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae are also a potential source of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and have broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Therefore, administering 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae regulates the microbiota in the colon probably through chitin, lauric acid, and/or AMPs, but should be further studied to clarify the underlying mechanisms.
