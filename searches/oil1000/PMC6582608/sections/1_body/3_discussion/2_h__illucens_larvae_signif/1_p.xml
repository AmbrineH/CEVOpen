<p id="Par44" class="p">Diet composition is the major factor that affects the gastrointestinal tract microbiota [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. In the present study, a diet including 4% 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae caused a significant difference in the colonic microbial composition compared with the control group, as revealed by the Brayâ€“Curtis PCoA and AMOVA analyses. The univariate statistical analysis indicated that a 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae meal (in 4% supplementation) markedly increased the abundance of many potentially beneficial bacteria and reduced the abundance of potentially opportunistic pathogens compared with control diet. Among the genera affected by the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae, bacterial species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> markedly increased in the H1 pigs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). The 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae treatment also increased the numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> in laying hens by an average of 7.44-fold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> mainly exerts health-promoting effects on gut physiology and is generally considered a potentially beneficial microbe. Thus, these results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae increased the potentially beneficial bacteria. Meanwhile, 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae also increased some butyrate-producing bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium</italic> in the colon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Some species within the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium</italic> together with butyrate, are essential for maintaining the intestinal metabolism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>], and have many beneficial effects for colonic homeostasis by promoting epithelial energy metabolism and stimulating immune development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. In addition, another important finding was that 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae significantly increased the number of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa bacteria (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Bacteria within 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa are regarded as a predominant population and are butyrate producers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. which play a crucial role in maintaining gut health. Therefore, the increase in the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium</italic> and the number of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa in the colon indicate that carbohydrate metabolism by bacteria may have been affected by administration 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae.
