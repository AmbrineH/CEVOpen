  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">Insects, such as 
   <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> larvae, are rich in chitin and proteins, and represent a suitable feed ingredient replacement for animals. However, little is known about the effect of administering 
   <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae on intestinal microbiota, bacterial metabolite profiles, and mucosal immune status in animals. This study aimed to investigate the effects of administering 
   <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae on colonic microbiota and bacterial metabolites production in finishing pigs. Seventy-two crossbred (Duroc × Landrace × Large White) female pigs (initial body weight, 76.0 ± 0.52 kg) were randomly allocated to three different dietary treatments: a control diet (Control group) and two diets corresponding to 4% (H1 group) and 8% (H2 group) 
   <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae inclusion levels, respectively. Each treatment consisted of eight pens (replicates), with three pigs per pen. After 46 days of feeding, eight pigs per treatment (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8) were slaughtered, and the colonic digesta and mucosa were collected for microbial composition and microbial fermentation products, and genes expression analyses.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">The results showed that the H1 diet significantly increased the abundance of 
   <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, and 
   <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium</italic> compared with those in the control group (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), with a decrease in the abundance of 
   <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic>. The numbers of 
   <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, and 
   <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa were significantly greater in the H1 group than in the control group (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, H2 diet increased the number of 
   <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa compared with the control group (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). For colonic metabolites, total short chain fatty acids, butyrate, and isobutyrate concentrations were significantly higher in the H1 group than those in the control group (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05); the H1 treatment caused a striking decrease in protein fermentation compared with the control group, as the concentrations of total amines, cadaverine, tryptamine, phenol, 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol, and skatole were significantly lower (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, H2 diet also increased butyrate concentration compared with control group (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), while decreased the concentrations of phenol, 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol, and skatole (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Pigs in the H1 group down-regulated the expression of 
   <italic class="italic">TLR</italic>-4 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (
   <italic class="italic">IFN-γ</italic>) compared with pigs in the control group (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and up-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokine (
   <italic class="italic">IL-10</italic>) and intestinal barrier genes (
   <italic class="italic">ZO-1</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">occludin</italic>, and 
   <italic class="italic">mucin-1</italic>). H2 diet up-regulated the expression of 
   <italic class="italic">ZO-1</italic> compared with control group (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the changes in the colonic mucosal gene expression were associated with changes in the bacterial composition and their metabolites.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">Collectively, dietary inclusion of 
   <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> larvae may enhance mucosal immune homeostasis of pigs via altering bacterial composition and their metabolites. These findings provide a new perspective on insect meal as a sustainable protein source rich in nutrient ingredients for swine.
