    <bold class="bold">Figure S3.</bold> Spearman’s correlation analysis between the abundance of colonic microbiota (at the genus level and qPCR) and microbial metabolites affected by dietary treatment. Cells are colored based on the correlation coefficient between the significantly changed bacteria (the relative abundance and the numbers of bacteria) and metabolites (concentrations). The intensity of the colors represents the degree of association. Red represented a significant positive correlation (
    <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), blue represents significantly negative correlation (
    <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and white shows that the correlation was not significant (
    <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Total SCFA: total short-chain fatty acids. (TIF 9517 kb)
