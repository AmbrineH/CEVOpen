 <p> Spearman’s correlation analysis between the abundance of colonic microbiota (at the genus level and qPCR), microbial metabolites and mucosal gene expression level affected by dietary treatment. Cells are colored based on the correlation coefficient between the significantly changed bacteria (the relative abundance and the numbers of bacteria) and metabolites (concentrations) and mucosal gene expression level. The intensity of the colors represents the degree of association. Red represented a significant positive correlation ( P &lt; 0.05), blue represents significantly negative correlation ( P &lt; 0.05), and white shows that the correlation was not significant ( P &gt; 0.05).
