  <italic class="italic">Piper aduncum</italic> seedlings were inoculated by spores of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) 
  <italic class="italic">Rhizophagus clarus</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Claroideoglomus etunicatum. P. aduncum</italic> seedlings were inoculated by spores of 
  <italic class="italic">R. clarus</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. etunicatum</italic> and then, development parameters, root colonization, lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, and essential oil (OE) chemical composition were monitored at 30, 60 and 90 days’ post-inoculation (dpi). The inoculation had influenced the plant height and root length at 30 and 90 dpi and microscopic analysis of roots showed the presence of hyphae, arbuscules and vesicles in the inoculated plants. Phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the main compounds in the EO. In the leaves, the concentration of phenylpropanoids showed a decrease, mainly at 60 dpi, with increased sesquiterpene hydrocarbon production. The main compounds were dillapiole, myristicin, and germacrene D; the dillapiole concentration decreased in all treatments. LOX activity had an increase in the leaves and roots at 90 dpi. These results suggest that alterations in the secondary metabolites of

  <italic class="italic">aduncum</italic> can be induced by its mechanisms of resistance during AMF interaction.
