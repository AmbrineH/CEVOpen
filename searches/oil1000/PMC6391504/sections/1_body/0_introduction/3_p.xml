<p id="Par4" class="p">The plants colonized by AMFs are more tolerant to low availability of water in the soil, making more efficient use of the absorbed water. In addition, they improve the plant nutrition, development, and the content of the essential oils, due to changes in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (Al-karaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2004</xref>; Nell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the production of secondary metabolites during the association of
