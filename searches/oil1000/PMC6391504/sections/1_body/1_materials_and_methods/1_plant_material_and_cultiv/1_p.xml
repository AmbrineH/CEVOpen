 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> was collected in Belém/PA, Brazil, and a voucher specimen was deposited under register MG 218522 in the Emílio Goeldi Museum herbarium, city of Belém, Pará, Brazil. Cuttings containing 1 to 2 nodes were propagated and conditioned in vermiculite expanded type B substrate (Urimamã Mineração Ltda, Santa Maria da Boa Vista, Brazil), and kept in a greenhouse under 70% shading. The commercial nutrient solution (Biofert Root) was applied to promote root development and reapplied after 15 days, and the cuttings were moistened daily. After 21 days, the roots had developed, and seedlings were transplanted into polypropylene bags of approximately 9 cm in diameter, on a commercial substrate containing a mixture of limestone, castor oil, bone meal, and expanded vermiculite type B.
