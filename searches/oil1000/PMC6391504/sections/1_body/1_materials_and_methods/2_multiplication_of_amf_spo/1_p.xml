 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1992</xref>). Inoculates, with the proportion of 50% each fungal species, composed of a mixture of spores (density of 90 spores/g soil), hyphae, root fragments and sterile sand, were used during the inoculation. Holes with approximately 2 cm deep were opened and the 6 g of inoculum was surface-spread on the roots. Non-inoculated seedlings were used as the control group.
