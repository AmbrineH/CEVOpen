<p id="Par11" class="p">The substrate was prepared using 78 μL of linoleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 90 μL Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), mixed with 10 mL of boiling water and a few drops of sodium hydroxide (0.5 N). The final volume was adjusted to 25 mL, resulting in a sodium linoleate solution (10 mM), which was stored at − 20 °C. The LOX activity determination was carried out with 5 μL of crude leaf extract and 50 μL of sodium linoleate (10 mM), mixed with 1950 μL of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM) at pH 6.5. The absorbance at 234 nm for the reaction was monitored for 60 s, using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Meireles et al.
