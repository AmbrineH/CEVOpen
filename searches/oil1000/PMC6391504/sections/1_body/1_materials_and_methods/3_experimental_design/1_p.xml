<p id="Par7" class="p">Experimental design was performed in completely randomized blocks. Each group was composed of 10 plants, which were labeled as control (non-inoculated) and AMF (inoculated by AMFs). Roots and leaves were collected at 30, 60 and 90Â days post inoculation (dpi) to monitor the mycorrhizal colonization, plant development, secondary metabolites, and LOX activity. All analyzes were performed in biological triplicates.</p>
