 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> were obtained by simultaneous distillation–extraction process using a Likens-Nickerson apparatus for 2 h and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-pentane (3 mL) as solvent. After extraction, an aliquot (1.0 μL) of the organic phase was analyzed by gas chromatography. Qualitative analysis was carried out on a GC–MS (Shimadzu QP2010 plus instrument) under the following conditions: Rtx-5MS silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm film thickness); programmed temperature, 60–240 °C (3 °C/min); injector temperature, 200 °C; carrier gas, helium, adjusted to a linear velocity of 1.2 mL/min; injection type, splitless; split flow was adjusted to yield a 20:1 ratio; septum sweep was a constant 10 mL/min; EIMS, electron energy, 70 eV; temperature of the ion source and connection parts, 200 °C. The retention index was calculated for all the volatile constituents using a homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C8–C32, Sigma-Aldrich) (Van Den Dool and Kratz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">1966</xref>). The identification of compounds was performed by comparison of mass spectrum and retention index with data present in the libraries of Adams (
