<p id="Par21" class="p">The presence of mycorrhizal structures into radicular cells indicates the colonization and exchange of nutrients between host plants and AMF, mostly in arbuscules, which are considered the key in this process, and present a development cycle until degeneration. In addition, water is absorbed by the external mycelium and moves through the hyphae, which favors the apoplastic flow in the root system of the plant (BÃ¡rzan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2012</xref>). The vesicles are globular or elliptical structures, which store lipids and glycogen, serving as a reserve organ for the fungus, and their formation can occur within or between the cells of the root cortex (Smith and Read 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2008</xref>). These fungal structures were also observed in roots of plants of
