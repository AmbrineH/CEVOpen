<p id="Par26" class="p">LOX is involved in the production of volatile compounds in leaves and roots such as alcohols, ethers, and aldehydes, which are considered both signaling and defense compounds (Liavonchanka and Feussner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2006</xref>). After biotic and abiotic stress, LOX activity is increased, and it depends mostly on inducing agents as well as the plant genotype and physiologic conditions (Silva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2004</xref>). The activation of LOX activity was induced by inoculation in the roots of
