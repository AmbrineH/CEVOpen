<p id="Par22" class="p">The developmental parameters of inoculated plants showed significant variation only in the height of plants at 30 and 90 dpi and node number at 90 dpi. Our results are distinct in comparison with 
 <italic class="italic">Piper longum</italic> plants inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">Glomus fasciculatum, Acaulospora foveata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gigaspora margarita</italic>, which showed an increase in leaf number. However, there was a decrease in root development, mostly for plants inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">G. fasciculatum</italic> (Seema and Garampalli 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2015</xref>). The height variation in 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> plants was similar to that observed in basil (
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic>) and rosemary (
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">G. clarum</italic> spores, which showed an increase of 45.49 and 25.93%, respectively (Russomanno et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2008</xref>). AMF contributes to increasing photosynthesis rate, favoring plant growth (Tanaka and Fujita 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">1979</xref>). The increase in height, but not in the number of leaves, indicates a possible production of photoassimilates directed to the needs of the plant (Neumann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2009</xref>). The AMF species 
 <italic class="italic">Gigaspora margarita</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Acaulospora longula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. etunicatum</italic> were considered as promoters of growth and better biomass production in 
 <italic class="italic">P. longum</italic> seedlings (Seema and Garampalli 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2015</xref>).
