<p id="Par23" class="p">The contribution of AMF to increases of nutrients and biomass can be important when nutrient availability in the soil is low, thereby promoting a higher efficiency through the benefits of photoassimilates produced in the host plant (Neumann et al.

 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> because we have used a soil rich in nutrients. The production of substances by inoculated plants may be related to defense mechanisms during the AMF colonization, which led to increased expression of defense-related genes and production of volatile compounds such as alcohols, ethers, and aldehydes in their leaves (Quaglia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2012</xref>). These metabolites are produced by enzymes, including the lipoxygenases, and are considered compounds involved in signaling and defense (Liavonchanka and Feussner
