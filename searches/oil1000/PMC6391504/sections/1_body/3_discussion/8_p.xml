 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">1995</xref>; Almeida et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2009</xref>; Souto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2012</xref>). Alternatives to increase the production of dillapiole were investigated through the inoculation by AMF in the roots. The results showed dillapiole production decreased in roots and leaves. However, several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes increased in the leaves, and 15 components were produced in the roots of inoculated plants. These results indicate a metabolic activity was induced by the inoculation of AMF and can serve to contribute to future studies on plant-fungal interactions.
