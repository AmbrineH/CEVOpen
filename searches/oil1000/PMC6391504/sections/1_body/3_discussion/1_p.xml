<p id="Par20" class="p">In the first stage of mycorrhizal colonization, the formation of the penetration apparatus (hyphopodium) occurred, presumably due to the recognition of signaling molecules of the plant by AMF, after the exchange of biochemical signals between fungus and host (Gianinazzi-Pearson and Brechenmacher

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2002</xref>). After the formation of the appressorium in the epidermis and the intracellular extension of the hyphae, the AMF was established between the cell walls of the plant until reaching the cortex (Kiriachek et al.
