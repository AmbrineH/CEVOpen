<p id="Par13" class="p">Histological sections of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> roots inoculated by AMF revealed evidence of the presence of mycorrhizal structures such as hyphae, arbuscules, and vesicles, which were absent in the control plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). At 30 days post inoculation (dpi), the cortex was colonized, and the presence of penetration apparatus composed by hyphopodium and hyphae (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b) were observed. At 60 dpi, an intense colonization was observed in the radicular cortex with presence of numerous intracellular hyphae (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c). At 90 dpi, the colonization showed completely establishment due to the presence of several hyphae, arbuscles and vesicles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>d–f). In addition, hyphatic anastomosis was also observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>g).
