<p id="Par14" class="p">Inoculation effects were evaluated on development of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> plants and the values for each parameter were compared to the control group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Statistical differences were not observed for parameters such as basal stem diameter and leaf numbers between inoculated plants and control group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Inoculated plants displayed a gradual increase in plant height at 30, and 90 dpi. The number of nodes in inoculated plants was higher at 90 dpi but had not displayed statistical differences at 30, and 60 dpi. These results indicate that inoculation benefits were demonstrated after 90 dpi. The increase of fresh mass was observed only in the roots at 30 dpi.
