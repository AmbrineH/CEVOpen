<p id="Par18" class="p">At 60 dpi, important changes were observed: the inoculated plants produced 15 compounds which were absent in the control group. Dillapiole production showed a decrease (61.12–54.15%) and a slight increase in the production of myristicin (18.38–19.93%) and elemicin (2.22–3.13%) was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). At 90 dpi, only inoculated plants produced detectible (&gt; 0.1%) levels of the sesquiterpene

The phenylpropanoids myristicin (19.25–18.47%) and dillapiole (54.27–51.96%) showed a decrease as well as the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons δ-elemene (0.40–0.29%) and α-copaene (1.91–1.63%). The minor compounds produced in the roots showed a behavior different than leaves, with a decrease of monoterpenes (
