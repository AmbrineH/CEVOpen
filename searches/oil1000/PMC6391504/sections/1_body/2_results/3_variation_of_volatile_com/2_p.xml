<p id="Par16" class="p">At 30 dpi, quantitative and qualitative changes were observed in the leaves. Quantitatively, a decrease in the dillapiole content (93.74–86.11%), and an increase of β-caryophyllene (0.27–2.62%) and germacrene D production (1.28-2.78%) was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Qualitatively, the inoculated plants produced additional compounds not observed in the control plants, including (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene (0.12%), terpinen-4-ol (0.11%), α-copaene (0.25%) and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-tetradecanol (1.54%). At 60 dpi, there was an increase in the contents of β-caryophyllene (2.16–5.58%), germacrene D (3.19–5.49%), myristicin (2.71-4.70%), and a greater decrease of dillapiole (83.57–44.73%). Several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were produced only by inoculated plants, such as (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-β-ocimene (1.10%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene (2.84%), and β-selinene (1.33%). At 90 dpi, only inoculated plants produced the monoterpene 
 <italic class="italic">allo</italic>-ocimene (1.64%), also displaying a decrease in the concentrations of dillapiole (48.66–39.36%), myristicin (3.26–2.41%), and apiol (2.54–1.83%).
