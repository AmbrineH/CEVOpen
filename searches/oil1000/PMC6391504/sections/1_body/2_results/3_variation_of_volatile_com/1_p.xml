<p id="Par15" class="p">The GC–MS analysis of volatiles of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> leaves and roots resulted in the identification of 65 and 79 compounds, respectively. The most representative compound classes identified were phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons such as dillapiole, myristicin, germacrene D and elemicin. In the leaves, the phenylpropanoid concentrations displayed a difference between inoculated and non-inoculated plants at 60 dpi (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The main change was observed at 60 dpi, with a drastic decrease (87.94–52.58%) in inoculated plants. In the roots, the most representative classes were phenylpropanoids (≈ 95%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (≈ 12%). The production of phenylpropanoid showed an increase only at 30 dpi. However, concentrations of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were lower in the inoculated plants at 30 and 60 dpi (Table
