 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Quantitatively, the production of dillapiole displayed an increase (71.65-84.65%) with a concomitant decrease in the concentrations of myristicin (17.45–10.52%) and elemicin (2.23–0.28%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In addition, there was a decrease in the amounts of α-copaene (1.20–0.30%), β-caryophyllene (1.50–0.53%), and germacrene D (1.16–0.37%).
