<p class="p">The 3D-crystal structure of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) complexed with captopril (PDB ID: 1UZF) and 3D-structure of geraniol (SDF file ID: 64Z) were attained by the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Before performing the docking analysis, we authenticated the docking process by removing the co-crystallized ligand captopril from the PDB (PDB ID: 1UZF) structure and re-docked captopril using PyRx docking tool via Autodock VINA software. This software was used to evaluate the binding mode of geraniol in the active site of human ACE. All docking settings, parameters, calculations, protonation conditions, and the overall charges were followed as previously described [
