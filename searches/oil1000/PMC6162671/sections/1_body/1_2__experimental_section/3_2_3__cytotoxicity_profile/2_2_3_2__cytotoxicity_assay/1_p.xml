<p class="p">The potential cytotoxic effect of TB essential oil (TB-EO) on various human carcinoma cells along with normal human fetal lung fibroblast cells was screened by MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, Berlin, Germany) as described earlier [
 <xref rid="B30-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Cisplatin, a standard chemotherapy drug was selected as a reference control (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic). The absorbance of the samples was detected at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). Determination of the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
