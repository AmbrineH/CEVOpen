<p class="p">Human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa-R2), colon cancer cells (LS-174-D3), lung adenocarcinoma cells (A-549-C5), and normal human fetal lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) were courtesy by Motol University Hospital (MUH), Prague, Czech Republic. The cells were cultivated as monolayer culture in a culture medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute RPMI;1640; Sigma Chemicals Co., Saint Louis, MO, USA) supplied with streptomycin (200 mg/mL), penicillin (192 U/mL), L-glutamine (3 mM), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (25 mM), and 10% of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) at pH = 7.2. Further, the human cancer cells were grown in 5% CO
