<p class="p">Gas chromatography (GC; Agilent 6890N, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) utilizing GC (Agilent 5975, Santa Clara, CA, USA) linked with a mass selective detector (Hewlett Packard-MSD5973, Santa Clara, CA, USA) have been used for identification of EO components. Parameters such as the instrumental setup, operational, and chromatographic settings were tracked as described earlier [
