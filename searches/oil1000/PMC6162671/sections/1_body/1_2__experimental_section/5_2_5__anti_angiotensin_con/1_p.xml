<p class="p">The catalytic activity of human ACE was assayed spectrophotometrically based on the formation of hippuric acid as a product following the method by Cushman and Cheung [
 <xref rid="B35-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] with slight modification. Briefly, the activity was initiated by incubating 166 mU/mL of human ACE (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic) prepared in Tris Buffer (50 mM, pH = 8.3) with TB-EO, geraniol, and captopril (standard inhibitor) at concentrations of 15 µg/mL for 80 min at 37 °C. Further, the catalytic reaction took place by adding the mixture to 110 μL of the 10 mM hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (substrate; from Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic). The absorbance of the hippuric acid was detected at λ 228 nm, and the % inhibition was calculated.
