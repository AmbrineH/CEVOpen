<p class="p">The cytotoxicity was assayed by treating Vero cell monolayers with TB-EO, geraniol (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-07-00283-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), and TB-EO with ACV (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic) in combination, as well as standard ACV using the neutral red dye-uptake method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B31-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of test compounds were determined as the concentration that diminishes cell viability by 50% when compared to the untreated controls.
