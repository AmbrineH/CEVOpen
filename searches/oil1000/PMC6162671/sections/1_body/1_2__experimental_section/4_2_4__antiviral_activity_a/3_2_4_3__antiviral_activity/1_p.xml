<p class="p">Antiherpetic properties of TB-EO, geraniol, and TB-EO combined with ACV against HSV-2 replication were assayed by the titer reduction method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B31-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. ACV was used as a reference antiherpetic drug. The 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was assessed as the concentration needed for 50% protection towards virus-induced cytopathic effects. Subsequently, a selectivity index (SI) was calculated as the ratio CC
