<p class="p">The 3D-crystal structure of HSV-2 protease (PDB ID: 1AT3) and 3D-structure of geraniol (SDF file ID: 64Z) were acquired from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. PyRx docking tool within Autodock VINA software (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to evaluate the binding mode of geraniol in the active site of HSV-2 protease. All docking parameters, settings, calculations, protonation conditions, and the overall charges were tracked as previously described [
