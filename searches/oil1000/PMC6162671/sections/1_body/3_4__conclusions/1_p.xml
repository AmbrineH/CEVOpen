<p class="p">Recently, plant-derived EOs have attracted the attention of healthcare providers worldwide due to the therapeutic properties against various diseases as well as the safety profiles. Our study showed that 
 <italic class="italic">T. bovei</italic> EO exerted remarked cytotoxic properties against human cervical carcinoma cells, colon cancer cells, and lung adenocarcinoma cells without affecting normal cells compared with that of cisplatin based on the determination of IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> concentrations that required to inhibit 50% of cell survival (see results and discussion section). Additionally, geraniol, the main component of EO, showed prominent inhibition activities against HSV-2 replication and suppressing the activity of ACE (see results and discussion section). Hereby, we present geraniol as a very promising agent in the treatment of genital herpes and hypertension. Subsequently, we confirmed the mechanism of action by using molecular docking studies. These studies have confirmed the basics of phytotherapeutical use of 
 <italic class="italic">T. bovei</italic> in Mediterranean region and its inclusion in North African pharmacopoeias. Finally, further studies should be conducted in vivo and in clinical trials to evaluate efficacy as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, leading to effective optimization of TB-EO and geraniol as natural cytotoxic, antiherpetic, and antihypertensive agents. Moreover, large prospective epidemiological studies should be performed.
