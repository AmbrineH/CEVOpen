It has been reported that infection with HSV-2 increases the risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as invasive cervical carcinoma. It is known that nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir (ACV) and its derivatives penciclovir, famciclovir, cidofovir, valacyclovir, trifluridine, and vidarabine are used to treat the HSV-2 infection [
