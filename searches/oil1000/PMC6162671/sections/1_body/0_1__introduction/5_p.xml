<p class="p">The purpose of this study was to explore the cytotoxic, anti-HSV-2 and antihypertensive activities of 
 <italic class="italic">T. bovei</italic> Benth. EO (TB-EO) and its main active compound geraniol, along with characterization of the phytochemical profile of EO as well as the quantitative analyses of total possible bioactive compounds present in hydro-ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the plant (total phenolics, total flavonoids, and total proanthocyanidins). Up to date, no previous studies were reported on the metabolic profile of Egyptian 
 <italic class="italic">T. bovei</italic> EO along with the above-mentioned pharmacologic properties. Therefore, in this study, we present the first report on such investigations in order to expand the medicinal value of this plant and hence promote its use in clinical use.
