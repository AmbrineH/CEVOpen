<p class="p">In recent years, natural products have attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical industry as an alternative or complementary therapy to the currently existing ones for the treatment of viral infections [
 <xref rid="B19-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The current pharmacologic treatment of HSV infections is based on the use of ACV and related synthetic nucleoside analogs, which interact with viral DNA replication via activation by viral thymidine kinase [
 <xref rid="B33-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The increasing use of antiviral drugs to treat HSV infections has resulted in drug resistance problem, which in return has switched the attention to plant-derived products in clinical practice [
 <xref rid="B53-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Generally, antiviral medications are categorized into three groups: virucidals, immunomodulators, and antiviral chemotherapeutic drugs [
 <xref rid="B19-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Based on the obtained results, we might classify the test compounds as antiviral chemotherapeutic agents. It has been stated that the resistance to antiviral drugs can be overcome by merging them with compounds from different classes of origin [
 <xref rid="B54-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Thus, the results gained by combining TB-EO with ACV have led to potent anti-HSV-2 properties along with less resistance. Remarkably, TB-EO, geraniol, and TB-EO combined with ACV seem to be anti-HSV-2 drugs of future that could be used for the treatment of HSV-2 infection.
