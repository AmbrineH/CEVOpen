<p class="p">Prior to carrying out the anti-HSV-2 assay, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of TB-EO, geraniol, TB-EO combined with ACV as well as standard ACV in Vero cells by the neutral red dye-uptake technique. The selectivity index is vital to control the probable toxic property of any medication on the cells that could be confused with an antiviral activity. The CC

 <xref rid="jcm-07-00283-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Antiherpetic activity was assayed in infected Vero cells, by titer reduction assay using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. TB-EO, geraniol, TB-EO combined with ACV along with standard ACV, have displayed pronounced inhibitory properties against the replication of HSV-2 with EC

 <xref rid="jcm-07-00283-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Our findings declare that geraniol (an active constituent in TB-EO) possesses similar anti-HSV-2 activity (EC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.94 µg/mL; SI: 108.25). Interestingly, TB-EO with ACV in combination exhibited a great synergy effect, which in turn enhanced the potency of antiherpetic activity against HSV-2 replication (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.81 µg/mL; SI: 259.26) compared with that of ACV (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.94 µg/mL; SI: 108.25). On the other hand, TB-EO exerted lower anti-HSV-2 activity (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 2.13 µg/mL; SI: 98.59) than ACV (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.94 µg/mL; SI: 108.25).
