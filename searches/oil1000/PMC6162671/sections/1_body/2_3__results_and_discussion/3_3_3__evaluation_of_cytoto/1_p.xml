<p class="p">Over the past decade, cancer has shown the capacity to progress resistance to traditional medications, and the growing frequency of drug-resistant cancer imposes an urgent need to operate further research and treatment development. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxicity profile of TB-EO in comparison with the reference chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin towards various human cancer cell lines, along with normal human fetal lung fibroblast cells. The results exposed that TB-EO exerted remarked cytotoxic properties against human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa-R2), colon cancer cells (LS-174-D3), and lung adenocarcinoma cells (A-549-C5) with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 7.22, 9.30, and 8.62 µg/mL, respectively, in comparison with that of cisplatin with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 4.24, 5.21, and 5.43 µg/mL, respectively (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 7.22 µg/mL. Interestingly, TB-EO showed very weak cytotoxicity on the normal human fetal lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 118.34 µg/mL compared with that of cisplatin (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 10.08 µg/mL). This indicates that TB-EO has powerful anti-tumor properties on cancer cells and no significant effect on normal cells. The cytotoxic effect of TB-EO used in this study could be attributed to the major compounds (geraniol, α-citral, β-citral, and thymol) present in TB-EO. In this study, we present the first report on the cytotoxic activities of Egyptian TB-EO. However, several studies have explored variable data of toxicology profiles of EOs on cancer cells from different

 <xref rid="B52-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], we cannot compare our results with them due to the variation in test methods used, as well as different cell lines sources and samples used. Finally, our results suggest that TB-EO might be used to treat cancer without affecting normal cells.
