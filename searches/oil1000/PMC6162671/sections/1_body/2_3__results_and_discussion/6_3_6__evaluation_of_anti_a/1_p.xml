<p class="p">Inhibition of ACE is one of the most imperative strategies to control hypertension and heart failure. The degree of ACE inactivation by TB-EO, geraniol, and captopril was signified by the amount of hippuric acid formed. Based on the estimated percentage of inhibition, TB-EO (15 µg/mL), and geraniol (15 µg/mL) showed prominent inhibitory activities against ACE with % inhibition 95.4 and 92.2, respectively, compared to captopril (99.8 % at a concentration of 15 µg/mL) (

Since TB-EO inactivated potently the hydrolytic activities of ACE, we decided to test the principal active compound in TB-EO, geraniol for further evaluation against ACE. Based on the obtained results, geraniol remarkably suppressed the hydrolytic properties of ACE. Accordingly, we may suggest that the inhibitory effect of TB-EO on ACE is attributed to the presence of geraniol. In this study, we present a first report on the inhibitory activities of TB-EO and its bioactive molecule geraniol against ACE. Despite limited investigations have confirmed that plant EOs have processed in vitro anti-ACE activities, we tried to rationalize our results with such studies. For instance, Zouari et al. [
