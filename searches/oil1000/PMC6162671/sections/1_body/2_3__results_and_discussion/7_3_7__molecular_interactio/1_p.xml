<p class="p">To better understand the potency of geraniol for further structure-activity relationship study, molecular docking analysis with ACE was conducted to predict the binding affinity of geraniol into the binding site of ACE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-07-00283-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), which contributes to rationalize the obtained biological results as well as the mechanism of action. The docking scores for geraniol and captopril, which are expressed as binding affinities, were found to be −5.2 and −6.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The docking results revealed that geraniol pound to the active cavity of ACE by forming a hydrogen bonding interaction between amino acid residue ASP-415 and the hydroxyl group of geraniol, which in turn resulted in suppressing enzymatic activity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-07-00283-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, all amino acid residues were previously described in the active cavity of human ACE and found to be critical for the stabilization of the enzyme [
 <xref rid="B62-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Although zinc is essential to the catalytic activity of ACE, geraniol did not bind to the zinc active-site and bound to the different active pocket of the enzyme. This means that geraniol is not competing with the substrate, and hence acts as a non-competitive inhibitor by preventing the formation of enzyme-product complexes.
