<p class="p">The metabolic profile of TB-EO (99.9%) is characterized by geraniol (32.3%), α-citral (27.7%), β-citral (12.4%), thymol (3.8%),

 <xref rid="jcm-07-00283-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the oxygenated monoterpenes appeared to have the highest percentage (82.2%), where geraniol (32.3%), α-citral (27.7%), and β-citral (12.4%) have formed the highest percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were found to be (10.1%), while sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were accounted to be (3.3%). Moreover, oxygenated sesquiterpenes (1.1%) and the non-terpenoid compound 3-octanol (2.2%) have been identified. It is worth to declare that our results are in total agreement with those results that have reported geraniol, α-citral, and β-citral as the primary constituents of EO of

These differences in the chemical composition could be correlated to several aspects including but not limited to the isolation procedures used, the impact of genetic, environmental, climate, and growing conditions, and in addition to the impact of organ age [
