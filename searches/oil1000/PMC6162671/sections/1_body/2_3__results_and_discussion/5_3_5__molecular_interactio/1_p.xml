<p class="p">It is known that HSV-2 encodes a serine protease that is vital for viral replication and hence represents a viable target for therapeutic intervention. Thus, a molecular docking study was carried out to unveil the binding mode of geraniol into the active site of HSV-2 protease (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-07-00283-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The docking score for geraniol, which is expressed as binding affinity, was recorded to be âˆ’5.4 kcal/mol. The docking results showed that geraniol bound to the active site of HSV-2 protease and hence inhibited the enzyme by establishing a hydrogen bonding contact with the hydroxyl group of geraniol and amino acid residues ASN-A220. Additional hydrophobic and other critical interactions were recognized (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-07-00283-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, all amino acid residues were previously reported in the active site of HSV-2 protease and are responsible for the stabilization of the enzyme [
 <xref rid="B56-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Since geraniol bound to the active-site of the enzyme, this means that geraniol is competing with the substrate, and hence acts as a competitive inhibitor.
