<p class="p">The quantitative analyses of total bioactive constituents (TPC, TFC, and total proanthocyanidin content) of HETB and AETB were determined spectrophotometrically. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="jcm-07-00283-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The contents of all studied phenolic constituents of HETB were observed to be higher than that of AETB. These results suggest the significance of used solvents. The polyphenols are more soluble in ethanol, therefore, HETB gave higher yields than AETB. Our findings agree with the literature, where methanol or ethanol extracts were reported to show the highest levels of total phenolics, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins [
 <xref rid="B40-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. However, several studies describe the water as the most appropriate solvent for the acquisition of the highest phenolic contents from the plant material [
 <xref rid="B42-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Our results indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">T. bovei</italic> contains a lower amount of phenolic compounds extracted by ethanol with the value of TPC 85.62 mg/g DW of plant material in comparison with other ethanol extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> species. 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> L. reached the value of TPC 158.0 µg/mg [
 <xref rid="B43-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">T. serpyllum</italic> 113.0 mg/g [
 <xref rid="B44-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">T. pulegioides</italic> L. 155.38 mg/g of HEE [
 <xref rid="B45-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. On the other hand, TFC value of 
 <italic class="italic">T. bovei</italic> (51.23 ± 0.43 mg/g) was found to be higher than that of different 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> species by using an ethanol for extraction and the same procedure to determine the TFC values. Nickavar and Esbati [
 <xref rid="B46-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] have reported the TFC value 50.39 µg/mg for 
 <italic class="italic">T. pubescens</italic> Boiss. &amp; Kotschy ex Celak., 37.11 µg/mg for 
 <italic class="italic">T. kotschyanus</italic> Boiss. &amp; Hohen., and 35.21 µg/mg for 
 <italic class="italic">T. daenensis</italic> Celak., respectively. The TPC and TFC values may significantly vary during the season as it was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">T. longicaulis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The habitat also plays an important role in the total content of the polyphenolics. Jaouadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] have described the variation of phenolic constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> (L.) Hoffmanns. &amp; Link harvested in six bioclimatic zones and Tohidi et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-jcm-07-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] have demonstrated the variations in chemical constituents of fourteen 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> accessions collected from different regions of Iran.
