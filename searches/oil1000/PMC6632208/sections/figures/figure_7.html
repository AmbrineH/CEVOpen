 <p> Candidate genes involved in flowering and terpenoid metabolism of 21 co-expression modules as well as the functional enrichment and subnetwork of M16. a Number of flowering-related genes (F and MADS) and terpenoid metabolism-related genes (P, C, T, MYB, bHLH, WRKY, C2H2-YABBY and AP2-EREBP) in each co-expression module. b Top 20 KEGG pathway enriched in M16. c Subnetwork visualization of M16. Nodes of different color represent groups of different type genes. The edges between nodes represent correlation of them </p>
