  <p class="p">Phylogenetic analysis of TPS and CYP450 families of M16 based on deduced amino acid sequence. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using RAXMLHPC2_TGB tool with the maximum likelihood method and displayed using FigTree v1.4.3. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> TPS proteins are clustered into seven subfamilies. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Proteins of CYP450 family are grouped into seven clans. Putative proteins of ‘JX-2’ are highlighted with corresponding subfamily or clan color
