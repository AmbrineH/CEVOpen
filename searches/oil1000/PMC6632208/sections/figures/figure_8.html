 <p> Phylogenetic analysis of TPS and CYP450 families of M16 based on deduced amino acid sequence. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using RAXMLHPC2_TGB tool with the maximum likelihood method and displayed using FigTree v1.4.3. a TPS proteins are clustered into seven subfamilies. b Proteins of CYP450 family are grouped into seven clans. Putative proteins of ‘JX-2’ are highlighted with corresponding subfamily or clan color </p>
