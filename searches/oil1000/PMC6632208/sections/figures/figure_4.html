 <p> DEGs analysis. a The overlapping of common genes from the two axes (F_1 and F_2). Total 9246 genes expressed differentially in flower development of first- or second-axis. b KEGG pathway classification map of 9246 DEGs. c The DEGs counts related to four types genes (P, C, T and F). d The clustering of co-expressed four types genes. The number of four types genes was shown on the right. e The clustering of TFs. The number of terpenoid and flowering-related TFs was shown on the right </p>
