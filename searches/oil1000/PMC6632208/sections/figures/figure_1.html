 <p> The morphology of flower at various developmental stages in lavender. a- d Schematic representations of L. angustifolia ‘JX-2’ inflorescence. Inflorescence with five-whorl flower was selected ( a). b a pair of multi-flowered cyme. Red ovals represent first-axis florets, which were indicated ‘F_1’ in ( b- d), and green ovals represent second-axis florets attached to first axis, which were indicated ‘F_2’ in ( b- d). e- l initial bud ( e) as well as first- and second-axis flowers at remote whorl (circled by magenta) of five maturity stages were used for analysis. The florets of first- or second-axis at fourth and fifth developmental stage were indicated by red or green lines, respectively ( k, l) </p>
