<p id="Par43" class="p">Given the ecological importance of flower opening time and floral scent emissions, the orthologous genes related to those two coordinated traits were manually selected. Differentially expressed transcripts encoding proteins with presumed (homology-based) functions in the biosynthesis, modification and transport of terpenoids as well as flowering were identified, including 46 genes in the terpenoid synthesis pathway (P), 35 terpenoid transporters (T), 112 cytochrome P450 hydroxylases (C) and 64 flowering-associated genes (F) (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media" class="xref">17</xref>: Figure S8, Table S5, 6). These four types of genes (P, T, C and F) can be classified into four groups with obvious stage-specific expression trends by k-means. Similar expression trends were observed at the same developmental stage between the first- and second-axis flowers. The expression of genes in group 1 (49 genes) and group 4 (74 genes) peaked at flowering time and flower budding, respectively. Twenty-four genes clustered in group 3 showed the strongest expression at FB0, while 110 genes in group 2 showed the highest expression level when the flower started to wither (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>d). We also found that the genes of four types can be detected in each group, suggesting that these genes may participate in the same biological processes. We also identified a total of 807 (approximately 8.7% to 9246 DEGs) TFs belonging to 69 families among 9246 DEGs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>: Figure S7), and these TFs were classified into four co-expression groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e). The TFs in groups 1–3 were decreased with maturity, while TFs in group 4 exhibited an escalating trend. The terpenoid- (
