<p id="Par44" class="p">Plant terpenes are synthesized in the plastids through the mevalonic acid (MEP) and in the cytosol through the methylerythritol phosphate (MVA) pathway, followed by condensation reaction catalyzed by geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) or farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) to form basic precursors of monoterpenoids (C10) and sesquiterpenoids (C15), respectively. And various TPSs catalyze a key biosynthetic step, leading to the production of tens of thousands of terpenoid compounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). In all, 46 unigenes related to 23 enzymes for monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids biosynthesis were obtained in this transcriptome database. Most of the P type genes were highly expressed in the flower bud, especially in the initial bud, such as 
 <italic class="italic">1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">DXS</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">MVD</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">IDI</italic>), while 
 <italic class="italic">(E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">HDS</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">HDR</italic>) were upregulated at the early stage of bloom (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). The transcript levels of 
 <italic class="italic">LIMS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">ocimene synthase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">BOS</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">germacrene D synthase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">GRED</italic>) and putative 
 <italic class="italic">sabinene synthase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">SabS1</italic>) were highest at FB0 and then downregulated, corresponding with the contents of the products they catalyse. In contrast, the expression level of putative 
 <italic class="italic">α-terpineol synthase</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">TEPS</italic>) was significantly downregulated at FB0, and the content of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpineol was lowest at this stage. Additionally, since lavandulol served as the preferred substrate for alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) to synthesize lavandulyl acetate in vitro, we found that the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">AAT2</italic> was upregulated before blossom, which coincided with the change in lavandulyl acetate content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). Five genes, including 
 <italic class="italic">flowering locus T</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">FLT</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">suppressor of overexpression of constans 1</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">SOC1</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">apetala1</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">AP1</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">leafy</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">constans</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">CO</italic>), are main floral integrator of five pathways (circadian clock, photoperiod, gibberellins, vernalization and autonomous pathways) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). Most of the floral integrator genes were expressed at high levels before flowering. Candidate genes in the five pathways showed variable expression patterns, suggesting an intricate regulatory network of these genes governing floral opening in lavender (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b).
