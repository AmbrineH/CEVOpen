<p id="Par45" class="p">To capture comprehensive transcriptome changes during the development of individual floret located on both axes, we built weighted gene co-expression networks to classify 9246 DEGs. Highly interconnected genes were clustered in the same module and we ultimately obtained 21 distinct modules (M1-M21, excluding module grey) shown in the dendrogram (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). Obviously, the gene expression profiles of first- and second-axis flowers had analogous rhythms and showed strong temporal expression patterns across ontogenesis (from immature to fade). Moreover, M16 contained a large number of genes (4709) with the strongest expression level at FB0 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b). The module eigengenes (MEs) can be considered to be representative of the gene expression profile in a given module [

 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>: Figure S9). Correspondingly, the relationship between modules and sample types was also recognized. The MEs of the 21 distinct modules were each correlated with distinct sample types due to their stage-specific expression profiles. Modules assembled in one group had similar sample traits. In addition, 16 out of 21 co-expression modules were significantly correlated with a single sample type (
