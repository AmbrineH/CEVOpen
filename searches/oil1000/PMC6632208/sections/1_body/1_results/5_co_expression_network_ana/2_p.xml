<p id="Par46" class="p">The module-volatile terpenoids relationship revealed that each terpenoid was significantly relevant to at least one module (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>c). Remarkably, a large portion of terpenoids (40 out of 56 compounds), most of which showed peak accumulation at FB0 [such as (+)-(R)-limonene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-trans-ocimene, o-cymene and 3-carene], exhibited strongly positive correlation with M16 (which was positively correlated with FB0). Nine compounds, most of which showed low accumulation at FB0 (such as linalool, linalyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol), were negatively correlated with M16. Moreover, 24 and 11 compounds showed significant correlation with M2 and M12 (which were negatively correlated with FB0), respectively. Interestingly, the compounds that were negatively correlated with M2 and M12 were positively correlated with M16 and vice versa. Eleven compounds were correlated with one or more fading stage-related modules (M19-M21). In M1 and M2, the gene expression level appeared to be elevated at anthesis of both the first and second axes. Cineole and (−)-camphor showed negative correlation with M1, while geranyl acetate, linalyl acetate and α-terpineol showed positive correlation with M2. Then, we focused on the relationship between the modules and the levels of three main compounds: M16, M13 and M19 were highly correlated with linalool; M16 and M2 were negatively correlated with linalyl acetate; and M13 was positively correlated with lavandulyl acetate.
