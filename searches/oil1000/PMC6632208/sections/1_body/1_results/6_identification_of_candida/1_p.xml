<p id="Par47" class="p">To validate the biological relevance of every module, we analysed the top 20 enriched pathways of each module by alignment of genes in the KEGG database. Half of all modules, including M1, M6–8, M11–13, M15, M16, M18 and M19 covered pathways associated with ‘terpenoid backbone biosynthesis’, ‘monoterpenoid biosynthesis’, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis’ and ‘ABC transporter’ (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM20" ref-type="media" class="xref">20</xref>: Data S1), implying the importance of terpenoid regulation during flower development. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a, we manually selected some candidate genes, including P, C, T, F, 
 <italic class="italic">MADS</italic> and several terpenoid metabolism-related TFs, in each co-expression module. We noted that genes associated with ‘monoterpenoid biosynthesis’ were significantly enriched in M16 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b). Complex interaction was found among 25 and 13 genes for terpenoid biosynthesis and transport, 34 genes belonging to the CYP450s, 9 TFs and 29 genes related to flowering (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>c, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>: Figure S10). Thereinto, 23 terpenoid biosynthesis genes were predicted with ORF. Based on the phylogeny and functions of known TPSs, four subfamilies of TPSs of M16 are recognized, including 2 proteins for TPS-a, 11 for TPS-b, 7 for TPS-d and 3 for TPS-e/f (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>a). 34 CYP450 proteins of M16 were classified into four clans. Notably, there are 20 and 4 proteins dispersed into clans associated with terpenoid catalysis [

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b).
