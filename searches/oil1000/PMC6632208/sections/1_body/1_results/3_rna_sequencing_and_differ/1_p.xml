<p id="Par42" class="p">RNA sequencing was performed to obtain the global transcriptomic dynamics in FFDSFSA and FB0. Total 159,337 unigenes (≥200 bp) could be detected with an N50 length of 1130 bp and 78,464 unigenes were successfully annotated to at least one database (Additional files

 <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media" class="xref">15</xref>: Figures S3, S4; Tables S3, S4). Comparing FFDSFSA with FB0 resulted in 15,212 (FB1_1 vs FB0), 19,887 (FB2_1 vs FB0), 24,424 (F3_1 vs FB0), 25,305 (F4_1 vs FB0), 23,929 (F5_1 vs FB0), 15,150 (FB1_2 vs FB0), 17,914 (FB2_2 vs FB0), 22,408 (F3_2 vs FB0), 28,289 (F4_2 vs FB0), 22,405 (F5_2 vs FB0) different expression genes (DEGs), respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>: Figure S5). These data suggested that a dramatic alteration of gene expression would result in significant changes in the contents of volatile terpenoids. We identified 7100 and 6302 DEGs shared by FFDSFSA and FB0, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>: Figure S6). Finally, in-depth analysis was further carried out on 9246 DEGs, including 4156 genes expressed differentially in the two axes, with 2944 and 2164 DEGs specifically in the first and second axes, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). Enrichment analysis showed 113 genes involved in “metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides” pathway (Fig.
