<p id="Par38" class="p">We selected the remote-whorl florets of the first and second axes at five developmental stages and the initial flower buds (a total of 11 types of flower samples, see Methods) for EO extraction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). A total of 34 monoterpenoids and 22 sesquiterpenoids were detected in at least one of the 11 lavender samples by GC-MS analysis. The content of each terpenoid was presented as a percentage of the total volatiles, and the 56 compounds added up to 99.99% of the total volatiles (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media" class="xref">13</xref>: Table S2). The results showed that florets at different developmental stages had distinct volatile profiles, especially the EO composition of FB0 compared to the flowers of the five developmental stages of the first and second axes (FFDSFSA) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1). A higher proportion of (+)-(R)-limonene (17.00%), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-trans-ocimene (20.57%), o-cymene (3.72%) and 3-carene (3.83%) and a lower proportion of linalool (2.18%), linalyl acetate (0.73%) and α-terpineol (0.62%) were characteristic of volatile extracted from FB0. With the expansion of the initial bud into five-whorl purple flowers, the main components of the florets became linalool (17.06~43.72%, indicated by blue blocks), linalyl acetate (19.35~32.24%, indicated by magenta blocks) and lavandulyl acetate (11.60~24.46%, indicated by purple blocks) with fluctuations at FFDSFSA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media" class="xref">13</xref>: Table S2). We also normalized the contents of volatiles using the z-score, and 56 compounds detected during different stages of flower development were clustered into four groups (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>: Figure S2). In groups I and II, 31 compounds exhibited the highest accumulation at FB0. Meanwhile, the average contents of 10 compounds in group II showed a peak at anthesis. The 14 compounds in group III accumulated in both FB0 and unopened florets and decreased with the flower maturity, while the 11 compounds in group IV increased with maturity, showing the lowest accumulation in FB0 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b).
