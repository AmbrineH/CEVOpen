<p id="Par39" class="p">When principal component analysis (PCA) applied in the 56 compounds, we found that (+)-(R)-limonene and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-trans-ocimene, which are the two highest compounds of FB0’ EOs, and linalool, linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate, which are the main components of FFDSFSAs’ EOs, were distinct from the rest compounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). Moreover, the volatile composition of individual floret from the first or second axis was significantly influenced by morphological maturity. Obviously, the contents of linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate elevated, but the content of linalool decreased when the florets were blooming regardless of whether they were on the first or second axis (F3_1 and F4_2). During the flower fading stages (F4_1, F5_1 and F5_2), the content of linalool increased. As confirmed by PCA of the profiling data for these 56 volatiles from the 11 flower samples, the unopened flower buds, blooming flowers and fading flowers of the two axes were well clustered and the area of distribution of FB0 differed more significantly from FFDSFSA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>d). In summary, oscillations in volatile accumulation were closely linked to the developmental stage of the individual floret.
