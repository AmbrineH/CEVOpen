<p id="Par40" class="p">Our preliminary field investigation found that few pollinators showed up before blossoming, while lavender was often attacked heavily by aphids (herbivore) at FB0 during spring in Beijing (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a, w). Then the number of aphids is diminishing with flower development and bare of them was left when lavender blooms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>w). Some other herbivores, like 
 <italic class="italic">Tetranychus cinnbarinus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>v)
 <italic class="italic">,</italic> stinkbugs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>j-m) were also observed in lavender. Simultaneously, we observed eggs, larva and imago of some predatory species, including ladybirds, lacewings, spiders and hoverflys on the inflorescences of lavender (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b-i, t, u). When the first pair of florets bloomed, bees (including 
 <italic class="italic">Apis mellifera</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. cerana</italic>) began to visit the lavender plants repeatedly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>n). As the percentage of bloom increased, a growing bee population was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>w). In addition, the blooming flowers attracted many other pollinators, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Macroglossum pynhostictum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pieris rapae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sarcophaga</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Calliphora vicina</italic> (Fig.
