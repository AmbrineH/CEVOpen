<p id="Par41" class="p">In the Y-tube olfactometer bioassay, 71.26% aphids kept away from the FB0’ EOs and chose the orientation without ordour (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>x). When aphids were given the choice between no odour and the odours of the two compounds, they significantly preferred no odour over the single 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-trans-ocimene (diluted to 20.57%) or (+)-(R)-limonene (diluted to 17.00%), which was diluted to the same proportion as in FB0, suggesting the phobotaxis of these compounds to aphids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>x). For assays of bees, the lavender oil extracted from blooming flowers (F3_1) attracted significantly more bees (87.50%) than a single standard substance (linalyl acetate, 72.73%; lavandulyl acetate, 72.09%; linalool, 45.35%). Linalyl acetate or lavandulyl acetate alone attracted more bees than linalool (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>y). The increased contents of linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate at the blooming stage and the greater attraction of bees implied that the linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate may contribute more to the attraction of pollinators, than linalool in lavender.
