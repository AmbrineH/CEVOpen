<p id="Par54" class="p">Numerous reports have illustrated that delayed flowering can increase the accumulation of primary metabolism products in plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], while few effects of alteration in the flowering time on secondary metabolism are known. Lv et al. (2018) demonstrated that inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">AaFT2</italic> may delay the flowering time and increase the accumulation of artemisinin in transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic>, but it is not clear that how flowering time impacted the contents of terpenoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">Petunia hybrida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. attenuate</italic>, reducing the expression of the clock gene, 
 <italic class="italic">LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">LHY</italic>), advanced the phase of scent emission as well as expression of genes in the floral volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. The oscillation of monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid emission is a consequence of the regulation of the gene encoding key enzymes in MEP and MVA pathway, which is also possibly controlled by the circadian clock. However, the interaction mechanism between flowering time-related genes and terpenoid metabolism-related genes in aromatic plants remained elusive. Our findings suggest a regulatory network involved in both in flowering time and volatile terpenoid and the potential link between them. As our current understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the flowering time and MEP/MVA pathway is still incomplete, a further investigation into the explicit and specific relationship is pending.
