<p id="Par52" class="p">The flow of emissions of indeterminate thyrse inflorescence in lavender ensured the continual visitation of pollinators and plant survival through history. Blooming, accompanied by changes in volatiles, is one of the major factors affecting the interaction between lavender and insects. However, the relationship between the floral scent and flowering time is rarely examined at molecular level. A distinct terpenoid profile was detected in FB0 compared to other periods in our study, suggesting that this stage may initiate a process of readjustment along with the activation of key regulators in the development of first- and second-axis flowers [

We identified abundant DEGs related to flowering time and terpenoid metabolism, providing rich information on the regulators of volatiles.
