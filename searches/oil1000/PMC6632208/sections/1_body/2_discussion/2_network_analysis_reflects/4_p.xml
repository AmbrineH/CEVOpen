<p id="Par55" class="p">The members of the 
 <italic class="italic">WRKY</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">MYB</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">bHLH</italic> families and the well-known 
 <italic class="italic">MADS</italic>, which showed co-expression with terpenoid metabolism-related genes, have been reported to orchestrate flower development in many plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Evidence from 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> has demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">WRKY75</italic> positively regulates flowering in an FLT-dependent manner, but 
 <italic class="italic">RGL1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">GAI</italic> can repress the activation ability of 
 <italic class="italic">WRKY75</italic>, thereby partially rescuing the early flowering phenotype of 
 <italic class="italic">WRKY75</italic>-overexpressing plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Several TFs appeared to be extensively correlated with most terpenoid metabolism-related genes in the subnetwork, implying that they may regulate an upstream step in plant secondary metabolism. It has already been proven that 
 <italic class="italic">MsMYB</italic> is a negative regulator of monoterpene biosynthesis in spearmint [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">MsYABBY5</italic> RNAi lines exhibit a 20%~â€‰77% increase in monoterpene production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">SlWRKY73</italic> can transactivate the 
 <italic class="italic">SlTPS5</italic> promoter in tomato [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]; and 
 <italic class="italic">AaWRKY1</italic> regulates the amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene, which catalyses a committed step of artemisinin biosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. In conclusion, the above candidates opened the door for trailblazing discoveries of the molecular underpinnings of terpenoid regulation. The expression or modulation of those functional homologs in lavender might thus be considered for applications in improving EO quality and biological control.
