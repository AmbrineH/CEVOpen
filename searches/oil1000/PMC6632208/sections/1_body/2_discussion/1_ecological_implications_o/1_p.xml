<p id="Par49" class="p">The cross-pollination behaviour of lavender species fundamentally determines its dispersal by means of external forces, and insect pollinators play an important role in lavender reproduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. The ringent two-lipped corolla, glandular trichome-rich calyx, protandry and multi-flower cincinnus of lavender elevated the ratio of intraspecific gene flow, giving rise to genetic diversity to enable adaption to hostile environments [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Our results showed that inflorescences with sequential and successive blossoms leads to long flowering-life and lasting attraction to bees. The fine-tuning of the blossoming sequence of lavender may be ecologically significant for the repeated and persistent visitation of pollinators. Concurrently, numerous and diverse volatiles emitted by flowers act as long-distance signals and important cues for attracting pollinators to spread pollen, which is believed to be an evolutionary advantage that helps plants preserve offspring in unfavourable conditions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. In this study, we identified a total of 56 mono- and sesquiterpenes in the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> flower for the first time, and these terpenoids can be classified into four groups according to the maturity of individual florets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Regardless of the sites of florets on the first or second axis, the changes in qualitative and quantitative terpenoids were closely related to flower development, indicating that the maturity levels determine the changes in compounds rather than the sites of florets.
