<p id="Par51" class="p">The most easily and frequently observed events were the initial visits by honeybees and other pollinators when the first floret opened. Three typical compounds, linalool, linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate, accounted between 69.17 to 81.49% of the total lavender EOs except in FB0 (19.44%), implying their crucial roles in responses to biotic and abiotic stress or mediating interactions between plants and visitors. Interestingly, the contents of linalool/linalyl acetate and linalool/lavandulyl acetate showed opposite trends with flower development; for example, decreased linalool and elevated linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate were found at anthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). It has been reported that lavandulol could be converted into lavandulyl acetate by the acetyltransferase enzyme (AAT3 and AAT4) in vitro, and an unknown acetyltransferase enzyme may be involved in the conversion of linalool and linalyl acetate [

Hence, more efforts need to focus on deciphering the synthesis of terpenoids and their derivatives at the genetic level and further resolving the relationship between these compounds. Additionally, a laboratory experiment found that linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate enhanced attractiveness to bees more effectively than linalool, possibly due to the pleasant aroma of monoterpene esters [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], the linalool content decreased at anthesis but increased during the fading stage in our study, suggesting that linalool may act as a repellent to protect lavender seeds against damage from insects.
