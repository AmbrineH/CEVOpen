<p id="Par34" class="p">The chemical components of lavender and lavandin EOs are characterized by the presence of monoterpenoids (e.g. linalool and linalyl acetate) and sesquiterpenoids (e.g. caryophyllene and bergamotene) and other irregular types. The lineage-specific terpenoids, which have arisen throughout the evolution of green plants, have generally been postulated to play an important role in mediating ecological interactions between plants with a diverse array of visitors, including pollinators, herbivores, natural enemies and pathogens, ensuring the plantsâ€™ reproductive and evolutionary success [
