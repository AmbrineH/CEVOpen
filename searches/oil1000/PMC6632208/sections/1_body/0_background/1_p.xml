 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. This family is known for its fine ornamental or culinary herbs such as basil, lavender, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme, and is an abundance source of essential oils (EOs). Plants of the

 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. latifolia</italic> and their natural sterile hybrid

 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> subsp. angustifolia, distributed in southern France and extending into the Italian Alps to the east and to Calabria in southern Italy, occurs naturally in very arid habitats from (250-) 500 to 1800 (− 2000) m on calcareous soils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Inflorescence architecture is among the most important characteristics of adaption and provides the very basic structural foundation that determines the maximum number of sites available for seed production and even the genetic diversity of the progenies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> is a cincinnus (containing 3~9 florets) with bisymmetric cymes divaricating 2~3 times, resulting in spiral or scorpoid forms. This inflorescence architecture is an efficient way to pack more flowers into a dense spike and, more importantly, can produce new flowers continuously over a period of at least several weeks. Although many florets of various developmental stages (from immature to fade) are scattered on one rachis, the blooming order of these florets is finely tuned: the two symmetric terminal florets open first from the base to the top whorl, followed by the four florets on the second axis that developed from each first axis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media" class="xref">19</xref>: Video S1). This blooming sequence helps to maximize out-crossing by increasing the potential number of different male parents, filling up for the less outputs of four one-seeded nutlets in each flower and the resulting heterogeneous patterns enhance the capacity to adapt to changes in the environment. Previous studies paid attention to the individual floret at a random position of the inflorescences or to whole inflorescences with different bloom ratios during the flowering period, but chemical and molecular analyses of different-axis florets at the same whorl were neglected [
