 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> occupies a top-tier position in the aromatic plant list from both economic and ecological perspectives and is regarded as a genomic model for studying terpenoid metabolism. However, to our knowledge, there are no global transcriptomic and metabolic analyses related to its flower development. A main objective of the present work was to examine the ecological implications of sequential and successive blossoms of lavender inflorescences and explore how lavenders orchestrate flowering time and the emissions of diverse terpenoids. Our results pave the way for a detailed understanding of the regulation of mono- and sesquiterpenoid synthesis in lavender and shed new light on the ecological and genetic flexibility of lavender inflorescences.
