<p id="Par36" class="p">As a powerful modern genetic research tool, next-generation sequencing techniques have been widely used to analyse many non-model organisms due to their low cost and high output. Many computational methodologies, such as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), are designed to provide insight at the system level and have been applied to high-throughput RNA-Seq datasets to detect molecular communication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. The clustering of genes in a co-expressed group indicate close regulatory associations between them, thus enabling inference of the biological function of unknown genes by ‘guilt by association’ with well-characterized ones. It is particularly noteworthy that co-expressed gene groups can be combined with metabolite datasets, and this strategy can detect genes (including both transcription factor and enzyme genes) that are highly correlated with specific chemicals [
