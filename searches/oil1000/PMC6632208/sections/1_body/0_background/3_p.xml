<p id="Par35" class="p">Lavender inflorescence is a typical model for studying the regulation of terpenoid synthesis at the molecular, cellular and ecological levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]; however, there is still almost no comprehensive understanding of terpenoid metabolism via network-focused rather than individual gene/protein-focused strategies in lavender. A nucleotide search of GenBank revealed only 15 lavender-derived sequences related to terpenoid biosynthesis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>: Table S1), which is quite insufficient compared to the pace of identification of volatile compounds in lavender. Moreover, previous studies have described the expression patterns of only a few TPSs with flower development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the orchestrated formation of various terpenoids is not only a function of biosynthetic enzymes, but also requires the involvement of the poorly understood terpenoid modification enzymes [e.g., cytochrome P450 monooxidase (CYP450s)], transcription factors (TFs) and terpenoid transporters.
