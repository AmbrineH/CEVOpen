<p id="Par56" class="p">This study provides, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive view of changes in gene expression and volatiles during the flower developmental reprogramming of lavender. We successfully profiled the transcriptome and volatiles of lavender flowers and detected detailed changes at both the transcriptomic and metabolic levels via an omics plus bioinformatics approach. Characteristic compounds and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest control. The precise control of each-axis flowering and regular emissions at transcriptional and metabolic level are important to pollinators attraction for lavender. Our study sheds new light on the ecological and genetic stability and flexibility of lavender inflorescences from “gene-volatile terpenoid-insect” three layers.</p>
