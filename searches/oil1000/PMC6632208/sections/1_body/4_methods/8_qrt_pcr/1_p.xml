<p id="Par67" class="p">The same RNA samples of microarray experiments were used for qRT-PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo (dT)
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). qRT-PCR analysis was carried out using the SYBR Fast Universal qPCR Kit (TSINGKE) on an Mx3000P system (Agilent Stratagene), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following standard thermal profile was used for all PCRs: predenaturation at 95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 15 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 20 s. Quantification was performed using the 2
 <sup class="sup">−ΔΔCT</sup> method, and data were normalized to those of the 
 <italic class="italic">18S rRNA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">actin</italic> transcript. Sequences of primers used are listed in Additional file
