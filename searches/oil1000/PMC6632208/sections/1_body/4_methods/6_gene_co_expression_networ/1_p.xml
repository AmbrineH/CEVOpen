<p id="Par65" class="p">A co-expression gene network was constructed using the WGCNA software package (v1.51) in R using all DEGs. Modules with default settings, except that the power is 8, minModuleSize is 20, and minimum height for merging modules is 0.33805. Genes with the highest degree of connectivity within a module are referred to as intramodular hub genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. The networks about hub-genes were visualized using Cytoscape (v.3.0.0).
