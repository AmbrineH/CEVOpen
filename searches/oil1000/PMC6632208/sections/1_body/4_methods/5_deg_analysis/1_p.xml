<p id="Par64" class="p">The expression abundance of corresponding unigenes was represented by fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions of base pairs sequenced (FPKM). The DEGs between various samples were identified and filtered with the R package DESeq. We used FDR &lt; 0.01 and the absolute value of log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(ratio) ≥ 2 as thresholds to define differential gene expression. The FPKM between the biological replications was analysed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and the closer the r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value to 1, the stronger was the correlation between samples. The highest r value among three biological replicates samples of each developmental stage indicated the stability and reproducibility of the data (Additional file
