<p id="Par66" class="p">Flower visits of insects were observed from 10:00 to 11:00 am in the field from bud appearing to blossom ending. The number of visitors was recorded during different flower developmental stages. For laboratory experiments, the behavioural responses to specific mono- or sesquiterpenoids of 
 <italic class="italic">A. mellifera</italic> (at uniform growth and activity) and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> were conducted in a Y-tube olfactometer at 22 ± 2 °C (room temperature). Two glass vessels containing an odour source (2 μl of white oil or a standard substance diluted to a specific percentage: 20.57% (v/v) of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-trans-ocimene, 17.0% (v/v) of (+)-(R)-limonene, which is similar to the concentration ratio of FB0; 32.2% of linalyl acetate, 16.3% of lavandulyl acetate, 30.8% of linalool (which is similar to the concentration ratio of F3_1) were connected to the arms of the Y-tube olfactometer using Teflon tubes. A fluorescent light at an intensity of 30–35 μmol photons m
 <sup class="sup">− 2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> was used to illuminate the middle of the crotch of the Y-tube. The experiment started with the release of bees or aphids at the base of the Y-tube with ventilation. Each insect was observed for a maximum of 5 min, and a choice was recorded when the bee reached the middle of either arm and remained in that arm for at least 10 s. When the insect did not make a choice within 5 min, a ‘no choice’ behavioral response was recorded. Each experiment was repeated 3 times (i.e., 3 × 30 starved insects) for a particular concentration of odor source on 3 different experimental days with new groups of insects and new odor source per day. Experiments with other concentrations of odor sources were conducted in the same manner.
