<p id="Par58" class="p">In total, we collected 33 flower samples, including an original bud as well as the two-axis florets of five maturity stages in a remote whorl, each with three replicates. Harvested flowers were divided into two portions: the first was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C for RNA extraction, and the other was placed in the shade to dry for chemical component identification.</p>
