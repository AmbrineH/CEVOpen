<p id="Par57" class="p">The experiment was carried out at the experimental farm, Aromatic Plants Resources Development and Engineering Laboratory of Xinjiang production and Construction Corps, Yili, Xinjiang (43°50′9.66″N, 81°10′21.73″E), during spring-summer (from 10th, May to 29th, June) season of 2016. Samples were collected from 2-year-old 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> ‘JX-2’ bred by our laboratory, which is planted in row width of 1 m apart, with 50 cm between plants. The voucher specimen of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> ‘JX-2’ was kept at the Chinese national herbarium, Institute of Botany, Chinese academy of sciences (voucher specimen: 02308796). To maintain the uniformity of plant material, the first and second axes of florets from the remote whorl of 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic> ‘JX-2’, which clusters five discontinuous whorl florets in a spike, were selected for in-depth study. The two symmetric adaxial florets (indicated by ‘1’ in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) opened first from the base to the terminal of one rachis, followed by the second-axis florets (indicated by ‘2’ in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) developed from each first axis. To distinguish the two-axis florets better, we named the florets “stage_axis”: here, “stage” referred to the flower developmental stages defined in Guitton et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], where “F” means flower, “FB” means flower bud and “1–5” five degrees of maturity, and the stages of the second-axis flowers were named in the same pattern as the first-axis flowers.
