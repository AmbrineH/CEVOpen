  <italic class="italic">Ulva lactuca</italic> is a green macro alga involved in devastating green tides observed worldwide. These green tides or blooms are a consequence of human activities. 
  <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms occur mainly in shallow waters and the decomposition of this alga can produce dangerous vapors. 
  <italic class="italic">Ulva lactuca</italic> is a species usually resembling lettuce, but genetic analyses demonstrated that other green algae with tubular phenotypes were 
  <italic class="italic">U. lactuca</italic> clades although previously described as different species or even genera. The capacity for 
  <italic class="italic">U. lactuca</italic> to adopt different phenotypes can be due to environment parameters, such as the degree of water salinity or symbiosis with bacteria. No efficient ways have been discovered to control these green tides, but the Mediterranean seas appear to be protected from blooms, which disappear rapidly in springtime. 
  <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> contains commercially valuable components, such as bioactive compounds, food or biofuel. The biomass due to this alga collected on beaches every year is beginning to be valorized to produce valuable compounds. This review describes different processes and strategies developed to extract these different valuable components.
