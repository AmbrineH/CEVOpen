 <p> Simplified scheme of a biorefinery process according to final utilizations [ 83]. Different washing steps were proposed to remove salts. After evaporation of the washing water, the protein content increased by 11–24% and the energy content by 20–50%. The adequate selection of the operating procedures (temperature, filtration and chemical treatment) determined the chemical composition of extracts. </p>
