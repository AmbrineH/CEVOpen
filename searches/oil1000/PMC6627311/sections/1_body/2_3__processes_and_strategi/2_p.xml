<p class="p">In order to selectively separate the target components from natural materials, a solvent extraction stage is required. The solvent extraction process is a mass transfer unit operation from a solid material with a solvent, which shows preferential affinity for the target solutes. Different variables are important in the final yield: particle size, solvent type, solvent to solid ratio and temperature. These operational conditions require individual or combined optimization in order to maximize yields, the extraction rate and the purity and properties of the products.</p>
