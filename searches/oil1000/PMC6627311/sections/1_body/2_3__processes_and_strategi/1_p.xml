 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> collected on beaches leads to different problems, such as contamination with sands and pollutants from different origins. Industrial processes to produce artificially 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> were developed to offer a production that is economically feasible and to attain a rational utilization of biomass following a biorefinery approach [
 <xref rid="B58-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] since the sequential extraction of value-added products in a biorefinery is more efficient and viable [

 <xref rid="B60-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The medium nutrient content influences the fatty acid content; the ω-6/ω-3 fatty acids ratio and also the chlorophyll, carotenoid and phenolic contents, and therefore the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B32-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Also, the extraction technology and operational conditions have a marked influence on the yields and on the properties of the target compounds.
