<p class="p">Ulvan extraction is better with a coagulationâ€“sedimentation process to shorten the filtration time of the residual biomass after the extraction step, although this chemical treatment reduced the yield due to coprecipitation [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> is more efficient with lysis solutions containing surfactants than with buffer or deionized water alone. The proteins further hydrolyzed with protease confirmed the availability and the lack of cytotoxicity in Vero cells [

Simultaneous distillation and extraction to prepare volatile compounds (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols and hydrocarbons) show antimicrobial activities and inhibition of tyrosine kinase [
