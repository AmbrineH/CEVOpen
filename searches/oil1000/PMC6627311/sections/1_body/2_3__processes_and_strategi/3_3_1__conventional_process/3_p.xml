<p class="p">An important group of bioactive compounds are phenols, although their content in green algae is lower than in brown types. They are usually extracted with organic solvents, the type of solvent being important on the extract yields and properties. Conventional solvent extraction with methanol or ethanol is used for the extraction of phenols and ethyl acetate [
