<p class="p">Macro algal proteins and oligo- and polysaccharides are potential raw materials for the new generation of health ingredients having both techno- and bio-functional applications. Their extraction is usually placed in initial steps and the latter steps are usually those leading to biofuels [
 <xref rid="B75-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. The interest to extract valuable components present in the biomass in initial steps (phenolic and protein fractions) is to improve the economy of ethanol production and favor industrial implementation [
 <xref rid="B76-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. The utilization of the protein fractions would represent an opportunity for developing countries, which permanently face a protein shortage. The extraction processes should provide high protein yields, preserving the quality (amino acid profile and digestibility) and avoiding the presence of antinutritional compounds. Moreover, the extraction process should find its optimal placement in the whole bioethanol production chain.
