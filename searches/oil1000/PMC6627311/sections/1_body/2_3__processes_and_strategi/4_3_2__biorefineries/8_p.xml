<p class="p">A multistep integrated process for the extraction of different products from 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> provides opportunities to develop novel products and commercial applications [
 <xref rid="B83-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. The protein content is 11% in dry weight and protein digestibility is 86%, indicating its suitability for use in food supplements. The cellulose extraction is the final step in this integrated approach and is the least affected by the up-stream treatments compared to other components. A similar strategy using 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> leftovers after enzymatic saccharification proposes a use for aquaculture food [
 <xref rid="B84-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. During saccharification, the relative ash and carbohydrate content is reduced, but total nitrogen, total carbon and lipid content increase, making possible the survival and growth of bivalve spat and commercially valuable sea urchins over the course of three-week preliminary trials. Finally, another biorefinery approach integrates the hydrothermal liquefaction for biomass conversion to produce fuels (bio-oil and gas), aqueous fertilizers and remediation agents for domestic and marine culture effluents [
 <xref rid="B85-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. This technology is now used to transform macroalgae into aqueous phase products. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> offers the highest bio-oil yields. Hydrothermal liquefaction is effective for 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> conversion, giving the highest bio-crude yields up to 29.9% and containing up to 60% of the total biomass energy content.
