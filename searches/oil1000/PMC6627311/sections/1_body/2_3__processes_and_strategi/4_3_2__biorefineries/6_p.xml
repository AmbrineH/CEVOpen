<p class="p">An interesting valorization is obtained from leftovers due to the 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> polysaccharide extraction process using hot water and enzymes [
 <xref rid="B79-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. This material was added to potato chip dough at a level of 2.5%. The water activity of chips with this 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> extract was significantly less than other control chips without 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic>. The addition of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> leftovers increased the protein, ash and dietary fiber contents of baked potato chips. However, sensory scores showed that green algal addition produced an unacceptable color and strong seaweed flavor. The solid residue after the extraction of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> polysaccharides was also used to promote growth and to enhance non-specific immune and disease resistance enhancement against 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> in white shrimp 
 <italic class="italic">Litopenaeus vannamei</italic> [
 <xref rid="B80-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. The animal mortality in the group fed with 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> leftovers was lower compared with the control; the survival in the group fed with the polysaccharides extracted with cold water was 80%. In the group feed with the polysaccharides extracted with hot water, it was 65%, and in the control group, it was 40%.
