 <xref rid="B81-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The sugars in the biomass are solubilized by hot water treatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and centrifugation, resulting in a sugar-rich hydrolysate, and a protein-enriched extracted fraction, which could be advantageously used in animal feed compared to intact seaweeds. The content in essential amino acids and digestibility suggest a promising use in diets for monogastric animals. Reduction of the high content in minerals and trace elements may be required to allow a high inclusion level of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> products in animal diets. The hydrolysate is used successfully for the production of acetone, butanol, ethanol and 1,2-propanediol [
