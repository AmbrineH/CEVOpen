 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms represent a non-competitive green source for production of biofuels and other commodity materials. Abundant recent studies have confirmed the potential of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> for biorefinery. A general scheme following this strategy is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00357-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The major challenges for seaweed biorefineries are in relation with the production of high value products, the lower use of chemicals and waste disposal. The integrated biorefinery philosophy can solve different problems associated with the algal biomass conversion to bioenergy [
