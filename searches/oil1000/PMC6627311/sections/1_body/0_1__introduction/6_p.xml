<p class="p">Preliminary experiments suggest that in the Mediterranean seas there is a virus that might provide a natural and ecological way to control 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms occur in the Mediterranean seas but disappear rapidly, and an enzyme activity related to giant viruses was observed in the bay of Marseille on denatured 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> tissues (manuscript in preparation). Viruses are well known to participate in the control of microalgae blooms, but this is not demonstrated for macroalgae. Virus controls of microalgae blooms were recently observed in USA, with the two macroalgae

 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In these two cases, it was because of viruses that have been recently discovered and have been called giant viruses. Giant viruses were first discovered in amoebae [

 <italic class="italic">Parvoviridae</italic> infecting pigs), giant viruses have a size of up to 1 Âµm. Since then, giant viruses have been discovered all across the world, infecting many species, particularly marine species [
