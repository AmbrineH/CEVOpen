 <italic class="italic">Ulva lactuca</italic> is a macroalgae and belongs to the phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorophyta</italic>, described by Linnaeus in the Baltic Sea in the seventeenth century [
 <xref rid="B1-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. It is able to grow attached, sessile or free floating. The capacity to reproduce involving two methods, one being sexual and the other being from fragmentation of the thallus, is rarely observed in macroalgae [
 <xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], but this provides a capacity for it to rapidly proliferate by covering the water surface, decreasing the biodiversity even for other algae species [
 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva lactuca</italic> is a polymorphic species with morphologies dependent on the degree of water salinity [
 <xref rid="B4-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] or symbiosis with bacteria [
