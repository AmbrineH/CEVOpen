<p class="p">The high carbohydrate fraction includes a large variety of easily-soluble polysaccharides, such as laminarin, alginate, mannitol or fucoidan in brown types; starch, mannans and sulphated galactans in red types and Ulvan in green types [
 <xref rid="B7-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Alginate, one of the main structural polymers of brown seaweeds, provides both stability and flexibility for the specimens exposed to flowing water, and is one of the industrially-relevant carbohydrate compounds found in seaweed biomass, as are other hydrocolloids, such as agar and carrageenans, which are commonly used as thickeners, gelling agents or emulsifiers. Various other non-carbohydrate products obtained from seaweeds include protein, lipids, phenols and terpenoids, and minerals such as iodine, potash and phosphorus—useful for human and animal nutrition [

 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The interest of macroalgae in human nutrition is due to their high mineral concentrations (such as calcium, magnesium and potassium) and glutamic acid, which makes them also useful as taste enhancers. Algae could help to address one of the biggest challenges currently faced by the food industry, which is the ever growing human population. Algae are also a source of active principles largely unexplored for pharmaceutical products [
 <xref rid="B7-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The gelling properties of polysaccharides are well known, and the therapeutic applications are in development [

Algal polysaccharides, pigments, proteins, amino acids and phenolic compounds are potential functional food ingredients for health maintenance and the prevention of chronic diseases, with increasing potential uses in pharmaceutical industries [
