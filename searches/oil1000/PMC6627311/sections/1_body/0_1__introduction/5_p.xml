 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms damage marine ecosystems and impair local tourism [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> principally invades beaches, and its biodegradation can produce acidic vapors that have induced the death of animals and possibly humans since a horse was reported dead in 2009 on the Brittany coasts (located at the west of France) due to 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> biodegradation [
 <xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The first 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> bloom to be described was in Belfast (in the north of Ireland) at the end of the nineteenth century [
 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms were well-studied in the Laguna of Venice from 1930, with an unexplained decrease observed after 1990 [
 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Since 1980, 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms have been observed worldwide, from Galicia [
 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] to Tokyo Bay [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], including the American [
 <xref rid="B20-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and Australian continents [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However the largest events in the world to date have been the green tides observed in the Yellow Sea for ten consecutive years from 2007 and covering 10% of the Yellow Sea [
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In Europe, Brittanyâ€™s north coasts have the biggest 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms [
 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. While there is no doubt that 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms are due to human activities, it is generally farmers who are accused of being fully responsible for 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms because of their use of fertilizers [
 <xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, for the green tides of Belfast and Venice, a correlation was established with human waste, due to an increase of workers [
 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] or tourists [
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Furthermore, abundant sources of nitrogen and phosphorus are important for 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms, but phosphorus does not come from agricultural activity [
 <xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and it is difficult to determine what part of nitrogen is due to fertilizers or human waste.
