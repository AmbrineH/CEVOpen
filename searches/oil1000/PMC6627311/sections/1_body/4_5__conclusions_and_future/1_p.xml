<p class="p">This review shows that many different approaches have been developed to valorize 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic>. The potential valorization of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> to produce bioethanol was particularly studied. Ethanol is actually mainly commercialized as an adjuvant (up to 15%) to diesel (or gazole) fuel that does not require an adaptation of the diesel engine. It could be a tool to fight air pollution from vehicles because of its biodegradable nature, since ethanol contains 35% oxygen and adding oxygen to diesel results in more complete fuel combustion, reducing harmful tailpipe emissions [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission. The problem is that bioethanol can also be obtained from sugar cane or other agricultural productions at a much lower cost compared to 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> biorefinery, regardless of the process. Furthermore, the use of diesel or other organic fuels should decrease to reduce CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission. It is therefore probable that efforts to have a competitive source of bioethanol from 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> could turn out to be useless in the future when electricity and hydrogen will replace organic fuels.
