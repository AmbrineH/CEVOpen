 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> blooms will remain a source of troubles that could grow with increased global warming. However, there is a natural law called “kill the winner” that may interrupt this 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> success story. When there is proliferation of a species, a predator of this species appears to control this proliferation. Among the most powerful natural predators, the biggest is not necessarily the most efficient. Viruses have demonstrated this, even for the human since the HIV has been found to be our most dangerous predator [

What is interesting with viruses is their specificity regarding their target, which is not the case for other predators such as humans, who can control or eradicate many different species. The apparition of a virus specific of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> may be a consequence of the high concentration of viruses in the Mediterranean seas. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in sea waters that can be found even in the bathypelagic (1000 to 2000 m) zone, and the Mediterranean seas appear to have the highest concentration, mainly in the epipelagic (5 m) zone [

Prokaryotes and unicellular algae appear to be the main viral hosts, but only 9% of sequences obtained from the viral fraction had an identifiable viral origin, and no research has been carried out with sequences specific to giant viruses [
