<p class="p">The valorization of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> wastes will also remain difficult for pharmaceutical drugs, cosmetics or food due to contaminants that have to be eliminated. New compounds useful for the pharmaceutical industry that could be isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> will have to be chemically produced to be commercialized. It is important to note that screenings with biological tests should be preferentially carried out on the 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> protein fraction, since it is easier to have authorization for a clinical trial with injectable synthetic proteins [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> with enzymes to obtain new products that may have interest for the food industry, as it possible now from vineyard biomass [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic>. Finally, it would be possible to introduce into the 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> genome genes from plants such as strawberry [
