<p class="p">Pre-treatment (physical, chemical, enzymatic) of macroalgae has considerable influence on the technical, economic and environmental sustainability of biogas production. Different pre-treatments of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> for biogas production were compared, and the reducing sugar yields demonstrate that enzymatic pre-treatment was superior to acid catalysis, thermos alkaline and ultra-sonication [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> wastes collected from coastal areas can produce up to 166 L CH
