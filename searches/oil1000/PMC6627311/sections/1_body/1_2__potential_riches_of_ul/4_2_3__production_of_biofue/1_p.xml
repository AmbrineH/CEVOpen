<p class="p">The valorization of 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> biomass for the production of biofuels is attracting attention regarding three aspects: bioremediation for the ecosystem, a renewable energy source and economic savings [
 <xref rid="B45-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> can be an attractive source for biofuels, since its production does not require arable land and fertilizers. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> can grow in saline and waste water and has a higher ability in sequestering atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> than terrestrial energy crops [
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In addition, the growth rate and productivity are high compared to those of land crops, and they can withstand harsh conditions to survive under stressful conditions. The most studied biofuels are biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> could be an alternative to conventional oil crops because they contain oil, suitable for esterification/transesterification reactions for the biodiesel production [
 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. For biodiesel production, hexane is one of the most suited, but other organic solvents or their mixtures have been proven suitable for oil extraction from 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> biomass [
