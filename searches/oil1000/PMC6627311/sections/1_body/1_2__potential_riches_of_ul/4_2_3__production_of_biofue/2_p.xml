 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> biomass requires pre-treatment and/or saccharification and fermentation to be converted in bioethanol. Carbohydrates contain hexose sugars, which are suitable materials for fermentation in producing ethanol. The hydrolysis of these polysaccharides results in monosaccharides, such as glucose, mannose and galactose. These carbohydrates are easily fermentable compounds in anaerobic digestion, and their extraction makes possible a rapid degradation. The quantities of cellulose and lignin, normally abundant in terrestrial biomass, are generally lower in
