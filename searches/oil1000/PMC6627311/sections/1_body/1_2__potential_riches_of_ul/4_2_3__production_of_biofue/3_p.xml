<p class="p">The production of the third-generation bioethanol from marine macroalgae depends mainly on the development of an eco-friendly and eco-feasible pre-treatment (i.e., hydrolysis), a highly effective saccharification step, and, finally, an efficient bioethanol fermentation step. 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> has cellulose as a main structural component. Different hydrolysis processes are suitable to maximize the extraction of fermentable sugars, such as thermochemical hydrolysis with diluted acids (HCl and H

Efficient solubilization (over 90% of sugars) can be achieved by hot-water treatment, and further hydrolysis using cellulases and bioconversion is favored by the lack of enzyme and microbial inhibitors. In addition, nutrient supplementation is not required. Hot-water treatment of
