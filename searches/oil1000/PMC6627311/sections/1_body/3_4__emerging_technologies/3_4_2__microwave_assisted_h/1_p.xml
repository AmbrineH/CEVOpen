<p class="p">This technology is based on the use of electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the range from 300 MHz to 300 GHz. This non-ionizing radiation generates heat by two mechanisms that are ionic conduction and dipole rotation, which usually occur simultaneously. Microwave is proposed for drying [

 <xref rid="B90-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. This technique also offers operational and environmental advantages for the extraction of essential oils. Microwave-assisted hydro distillation was proposed to obtain essential oils with free-radical scavenging and antioxidant potential, as well as some components of medicinal importance to be used as a food additive and dietary supplement [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> oils to biodiesel was obtained with significant yields in 1 h at 60 °C with sodium hydroxide and at room temperature with Na metal [
 <xref rid="B92-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. The microwave assisted transesterification could be completed within 5 min, but the highly exothermic and uncontrollable reaction of sodium metal in microwave damages the equipment. A microwave-assisted direct

Microwave irradiation efficacy for hydrolysis was also demonstrated with the addition of polyoxometalate clusters to produce larger amounts of reducing sugars than hydrochloric and sulfuric acids and inducing a lower amount (less than 0.1%) of furfural derivatives [

Phosphotungstic acid was found to be the most suitable agent and was recycled at least three times by diethyl ether extraction without changing its activity. Hydrothermal temperature until 140 °C was highly influential on the enzymatic
