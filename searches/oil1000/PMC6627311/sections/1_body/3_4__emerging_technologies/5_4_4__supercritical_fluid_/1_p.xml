<p class="p">This technology is based on the utilization of solvents under conditions leading to the supercritical state, which presents physicochemical properties between those of the liquid and the gaseous state, facilitating the solubility and mass transfer. The preferred solvent is carbon dioxide, for its availability, cost, low toxicity and the possibility of using low temperatures. Carbon dioxide makes it possible to maintain thermos labile compounds and characteristics close to natural products. This has advantages, as the lack of solvent residues in the final product and the selective recovery of the target solutes in the supercritical extract would favor its potential use for food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Supercritical fluid extraction of

This technique provided a better quality for fatty acids, carotenoids and chlorophylls compared to conventional ethanol extraction. The presence of polyphenols due to this technique conferred antioxidant properties for cosmetic applications [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction made it possible to obtain extracts containing secondary metabolites with plant growth bio-stimulant properties. When applied by foliar feed on cress and seed maceration for wheat, the extracts enhanced chlorophyll and carotenoid content, root thickness and above-ground biomass.
