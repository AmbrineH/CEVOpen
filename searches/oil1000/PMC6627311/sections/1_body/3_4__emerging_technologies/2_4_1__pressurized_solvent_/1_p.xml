<p class="p">This technique is performed at a high temperature and pressure to maintain the solvent in liquid state faster, and it requires lower amounts of solvent than traditional extraction techniques. This technique is also named accelerated solvent extraction or high pressure liquid extraction. The use of food-grade solvents, such as ethanol, converts this process into a green technique suitable for an industrial scale, and is useful for food processing. The pressurized ethanol extraction of bio actives from
