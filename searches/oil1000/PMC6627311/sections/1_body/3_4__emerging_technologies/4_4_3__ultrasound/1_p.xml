<p class="p">Ultrasound waves create compression and expansion when they go through a medium inducing cavitation. This phenomenon due to the production, growth and collapse of bubbles, which implode in the liquid near the solid surface of membranes, causes surface peeling, erosion and particle breakdown [
 <xref rid="B98-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Intensification by ultrasound makes possible extraction due to a more effective mixing, and thermal and structural effects (fragmentation, erosion, sonocapillary, sonoporation, detexturation), as well as enhanced solute diffusion and washing. However, oxidation and degradation of compounds occurred as a result of solvent vapor, high pressures and temperature, which generate primary radicals susceptible of forming other radicals and molecules [
 <xref rid="B99-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. High power ultrasound can be an efficient tool for large scale applications because of improved equipment design and efficiencies of continuous operation. Ultra-sonication reduced the extraction time and solvent consumption, making possible a greater penetration of solvent into cellular materials and improving the release of cell contents into the bulk medium. In addition, this technique may also provide more economic and environmental as well as health and safety benefits [
 <xref rid="B48-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The ultrasonic pre-treatment method improves extractions of oil with higher efficiency, reducing extraction time and increasing yields, with moderate costs and negligible toxicity. The ultrasonic pre-treatment method also reduces extraction time [
 <xref rid="B48-marinedrugs-17-00357" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Solvent mixtures, i.e., diethyl ether and methylene chloride in n-hexane, can also favor high oil yields. Autoclave and ultrasound pre-treatments enhanced the oil extraction yield because they damage the 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> membranes. Extraction of oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> biomass using the ultrasound pre-treatment method showed better results when compared with other methods, such as deep-freezing, lyophilization and microwave pre-treatment methods, which caused partial hydrolysis and pre-esterification of the oil. Using sonication in water (and subsequent ammonium sulphate-induced protein precipitation) provided the greatest protein yields, but the protein and fatty acids content was higher with the alkaline protein solubilization [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> sulphated polysaccharides showed radical scavenging, reducing power and a macrophage-stimulating capacity [
