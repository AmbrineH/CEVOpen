<p class="p">Pulsed electric field treatment is based on the application of a high voltage (up to 80 kV/cm) in short pulses at room temperature. This technique causes the formation of pores in the cell membranes of the biomass placed between two electrodes and is referred as electroporation or electro permeabilization. This phenomenon is due to the accumulation of opposite charges on cell membranes and their move under the influence of an electric field. Tissue disintegration caused by electroporation facilitates the release of intracellular compounds, enhancing the extraction yields such as with proteins [

 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> biomass using hydraulic pressing, providing a higher extraction of K, Mg, Na, P and S compared to pressing alone. High-voltage pulsed electric field treatment was more efficient for cell-membrane permeabilization and protein extraction than osmotic shock [

The protein concentration in the final product increased because of the removal of protein compounds, and the extract had a higher antioxidant capacity. However, incubation with pectinase and pulsed electric field treatment was less efficient for the extraction of water-soluble proteins and carbohydrates from 
 <italic class="italic">Ulva</italic> compared to shear homogenization. The need for deep investigation of algal proteins and protein extraction technology for health is important, since osmotic shock combined with pulsed electric fields and hydraulic pressure produced extracts containing food allergens, such as superoxide dismutase, aldolase and thioredoxin [
