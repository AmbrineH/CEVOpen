 <italic class="italic">Saprolegnia</italic> spp. organisms are aquatic oomycetes, known as water molds, which severely impact fish health in aquaculture, fish farms and hobby fish tanks [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], causing hyphal growth as cotton-like mycelia on fish body surface and gills. Conversely, fish eggs are killed by hyphae breaking up the chorionic membrane of the eggs, thus provoking an osmotic shock [
