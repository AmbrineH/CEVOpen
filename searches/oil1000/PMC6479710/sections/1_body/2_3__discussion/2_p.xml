 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] report in vitro activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. flexuosum</italic> EO. In our study this EO showed a 2.5% MIC value, confirming this result. 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> EO, characterized by an analogous chemical composition and never tested before, was therefore included in the assay, demonstrating a 2.5% MIC, also. This same value was obtained testing 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic>, while further 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> spp. EOs did not show biological activity. 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic> EO only has been object of interest by other Authors [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] resulting ineffective. The unique efficacy of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic> among other species within the genus appears to be very interesting, and it could be explained on the basis of its peculiar chemical composition, characterized by the presence of linalool and linalool acetate, along with a lower amount of limonene, when compared to other 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> species.
