<p class="p">The feasibility of EOs practical application in aquaculture has been prospected by Khosravi et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], who evaluated the activity of natural substances in treating 
 <italic class="italic">Saprolegnia</italic>-infected rainbow trout (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) eggs, referring no statistical difference between in vivo and in vitro results. Despite this fact, they concluded that additional evaluations should be carried out with regard to the toxicity of these natural products. By the way, Hoskonen et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] report the toxicity of clove EO, when used to control saprolegniosis during incubation of rainbow trout eggs. In vivo adverse biological effects, as well as a toxicity of thymol and carvacrol on zebrafish (
 <italic class="italic">Danio rerio</italic>) models, were recently reported by Ran et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and Polednik et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. For this reason, the administration of EOs obtained from Lamiaceae family, containing large amounts of phenols, although biologically effective, should be carefully evaluated. Conversely, on the basis of the results obtained in the present study, 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. flexuosum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic> EOs would represent a promising alternative to above mentioned compounds.
