<p class="p">In the present study, rather high MIC values were obtained. 
 <italic class="italic">Saprolegnia</italic> oomycetes are characterized by a natural resistance to currently administered antimycotic drugs, also. This fact is probably due to their peculiar cell wall composition, made up of a mix of cellulosic compounds and glycan, and it could have implications for the low sensitivity to EOs commonly very active against organisms referable to Ascomycota and Deuteromycota, frequently involved in human and animal mycoses.
