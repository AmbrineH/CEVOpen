<p class="p">The in vitro antimycotic activity of EOs was evaluated on 
 <italic class="italic">Saprolegnia parasitica</italic> isolated from water in a rainbow trout farm and maintained on Malt Extract Broth (MEB). The effectiveness of EOs was assessed by means of a microdilution test carried out using MEB as culture medium. Portions of approximately 1 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of mycelium were used as fungal inocula in 96- wells plates (Pbi International, Milano, Italy). One linen seed was put in each well, to enhance fungal growth. Stock solutions at 10% of each chemically defined EO were diluted into MEB to obtain concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 5%, to obtain a minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) value, expressed as the lowest concentration, at which fungal growth was not noticeable. Plates were covered in order to avoid EOs evaporation, and incubated at room temperature for about five days, or until a full development of mycotic growth in control wells was observed. Portions of the inocula, in which growth was not visually noticed, were removed, twice washed in sterile saline, then were seeded onto malt agar plates to evaluate fungal viability. Controls were achieved to evaluate the sterility of each EO as well of the culture medium and seeding fungal inocula in medium without EOs. All tests were performed in quadruplicate.
