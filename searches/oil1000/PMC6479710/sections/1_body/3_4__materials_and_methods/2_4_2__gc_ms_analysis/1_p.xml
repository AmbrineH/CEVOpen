<p class="p">Volatile constituents of each EO were analyzed by GC-MS as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Briefly, a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness, 0.25 mm) and a Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA) were employed. Analytical conditions were as follows: injector and transfer line temperature, 220 and 240 °C respectively; oven temperature, programmed from 60 to 240 °Cat 3 °C/min; carrier gas, helium at 1 ml/min; injection, 0.2 ml (10% hexane solution); split ratio, 1:30. Identification of the constituents was based on comparison of the retention times with those of authentic samples, comparing their linear retention indices relative to the series of n-hydrocarbons, and on computer matching against commercial and home-made library mass spectra built up from pure substances and components of known oils and MS literature data [
