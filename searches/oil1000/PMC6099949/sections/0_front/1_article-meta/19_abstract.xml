 <p class="p">In this work, we studied similarities and differences between 70% ethanol in water extract (70EE) and essential oils (EOs) obtained from propolis, black poplars (
  <italic class="italic">Populus nigra</italic> L.) and aspens (
  <italic class="italic">P. tremula</italic> L.) to ascertain which of these is a better indicator of the plant species used by bees to collect propolis precursors. Composition of 70EE was analyzed by UPLC-PDA-MS, while GC-MS was used to research the EOs. Principal component analyses (PCA) and calculations of Spearman’s coefficient rank were used for statistical analysis. Statistical analysis exhibited correlation between chemical compositions of propolis and 
  <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> buds’ 70EE. In the case of EOs, results were less clear. Compositions of black poplars, aspens EOs and propolises have shown more variability than 70EE. Different factors such as higher instability of EOs compared to 70EE, different degradation pattern of benzyl esters to benzoic acid, differences in plant metabolism and bees’ preferences may be responsible for these phenomena. Our research has therefore shown that 70EE of propolis reflected the composition of 
  <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> or complex aspen–black poplar origin.
