<p class="p">The average amount of EOs in worldwide propolis is about 0.5% [

 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> buds contained 0.27% (fresh buds) and 0.12% (dried buds) EOs [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01262" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The majority of analyzed samples followed a similar pattern, except for PN3, where it reached 4.3%. It may have been due to the highest apparent proportional content of resins in those samples. However, detailed investigation of resin content was beyond the scope of this work. For aspenâ€™s buds, similar information could not be found.
