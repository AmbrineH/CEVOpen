<p class="p">In the literature, only varieties of profiles characterized by high content of β-eudesmol (19.6%) and lower of α-eudesmol (6.0%) in dried 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> leaf buds were published [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01262" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Our results differed, as there were changes both to the general composition as well as to which of the compounds was dominant among them. Contrary to the literature data, the dominant compounds in the analyzed samples were sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, including 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>- and γ-curcumens, and δ-cadinen, and derivates of benzoic acid. It may be speculated it was due to regional dominance of different chemotypes and thus different substances that were collected by the bees. A similar phenomenon occurred in the case of the aspens, although this warrants further research.
