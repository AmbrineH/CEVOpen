<p class="p">Propolis samples had a composition resembling a mixture of substances characteristic of aspen (phenolic acid glycerides) or poplar (flavonoids) (18 samples) or exhibited profile similar to 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> (three samples: Polish, German and Canadian propolis). The most common black poplar components in propolis include flavonoids chrysine, pinocembrine and pinobanksin-3-

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01262" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Among the various phenolic acid glycerides, a higher concentration was observed for 2-acetyl-1,3-di-
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaroylglycerol. Some substances showed bigger peaks in propolis (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid benzyl ester) and some in its plant sources (pinostrobin chalcone). This apparent discrepancy in concentration could however be explained.
