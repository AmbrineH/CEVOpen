<p class="p">Obtained results demonstrated that 70EE composition is more homogenous than EOS. It is worth noting, however, that samples of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> sub clusters formed similar groupings for both 70EE and EOs analyzes. This is in contrast to the samples of aspens and propolises, where such behavior was not observed. It may indicate higher stability of essential oils from black poplar in comparison to those from aspens and propolises. It may be speculated it is so because 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> produces the exudates constantly throughout the whole vegetative season, while 
 <italic class="italic">P. tremula</italic> produces exudates in any notable amounts only before the cracking of the buds [

 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. tremula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01262" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and selection of plant material by bees. This also determined that non-volatile components (such as polyphenols) are a better choice to track propolis plant origin and may be used by bees as primary marker to select plant material before collecting [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01262" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, the role of EOs as a secondary marker cannot be excluded due to an attractant role of some of the monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and aromatic esters ([
