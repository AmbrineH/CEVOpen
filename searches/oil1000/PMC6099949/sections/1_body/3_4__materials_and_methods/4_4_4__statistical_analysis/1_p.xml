<p class="p">Statistical analysis included principal component analysis (PCA) (according to Statsoft, Inc., Kraków, Poland [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-01262" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. UPLC-PDA (for 70EE analyze compounds) and GC-MS (for EOS analyze) peaks (at least ≥10% in one sample) were used as variables. Reductive analyses were carried out, namely those considering peaks constituting ≥1%, ≥2%, ≥3%, ≥5%, and ≥10% of total area. Meta-analysis of the results demonstrated that ≥10% model explained the data sufficiently, while simultaneously eliminating excessive data input and preventing excessively close groupings of the points, both of which posed a problem in the remaining models, albeit to varying degrees. The authors felt it best to present only the last model in the publication not to make the interpretation of the results excessively bothersome and improve clarity.
