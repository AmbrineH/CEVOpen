<p class="p">The normalization of chromatograms of UPLC was performed as manual correction of the peaks to the baseline. Peaks of multiple compounds were separated into singular peaks according to the spectrum of the main component and main ion in UPLC. UPLC peaks were read at 200â€“500 nm spectrum for the reason of acquiring average values. For UPLC a mix of acacetin, apigenin, caffeic acid, chrysin, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, genkwanin, isoferulic acid, kempferol, quercetin dihydrate and pinobanksin was used. As standards of some of the major compounds present in the samples and contributing to the UV spectrum significantly, mostly phenol acid glycerides and monoesters, proved themselves to be unobtainable, it was decided that the analysis could only be reliably carried out as comparison of peak areas calculated as a percentage of total chromatogram peak area.
