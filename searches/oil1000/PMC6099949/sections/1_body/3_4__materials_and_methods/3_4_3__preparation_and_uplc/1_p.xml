<p class="p">Previously ground research material (propolis and buds) was extracted by 70% ethanol in water (proportion: 1.0 g/10 mL) in an ultrasonic bath. Extraction conditions were set at 400 Â°C for 45 min and 756 W (90% of ultrasound bath power). Next, extracts were stored at room temperature for 12 h and then filtrated through Wattman No. 10 filtrate paper.</p>
