<p class="p">Composition of obtained 70EE was analyzed by Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, CT, USA) equipped with PDA 200–500 nm, mass spectrometer Xevo-Q-TOF (Waters, Milford, CT, USA) and column BEH C18 130 Å, (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm) (Waters, Milford, CT, USA). We used modified method of Shi et al. [
