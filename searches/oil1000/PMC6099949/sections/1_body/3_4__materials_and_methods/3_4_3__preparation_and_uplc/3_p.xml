<p class="p">The elution system consisted of acetonitrile/0.1% solution formic acid in water. The gradient elution program began with 20% acetonitrile, and was increased to 30% in 10.70 min → 31% in 15.30 min → 31% in 15.90 min → 32% in 17.00 min → 34% in 18.00 min → 36% in 20.30 min → 40% in 21.50 min → 45% in 25.50 min → 50% in 29.70 min → 100% in 33.00 min → 100% in 36.00 min → 20% in 38.00 min.</p>
