 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01262" class="xref">Supplementary Materials (Tables S4â€“S7)</xref>. Seventy-seven components were identified in all samples, most of which were identified based on literature data (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-01262" class="xref">supplement Table S4</xref>), according to the characteristic UV (ultraviolet light) absorption spectrum and mass fragmentation in negative ionization mode. In the case of most flavonoids, free phenolic acids and their monoesters, exhaustive literature data allow certain extent of identification. Phenolic acids glycerides proved difficult to identify, especially prediction of glycerol substitution position to phenolic acids due to a scarcity of HPLC-MS ion fragmentation literature data and a lack of available standards.
