<p class="p">The profiles of 70% ethanol in water extract have shown certain variation between the samples. Propolis, aspens and black poplars exhibited qualitative and quantitative differences within their groups. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic>, four samples (PN1, PN2, PN3 and PN5) contained mainly flavonoid aglycones (chrysin, pinocembrin chalcone, galangin, pinocembrin-3-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-acetate and pinostrobin chalcone) and lower amount of free phenolic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid) and their monoesters (benzyl and cinnamyl esters of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid). Different composition was observed for three 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> buds (PN4, PN6 and PN7), which contained a higher amount of free phenolic acids and their monoesters, but contained less flavonoid aglycones than PN4, PN6 and PN7.
