<p class="p">Propolis’ EOs were usually composed of benzoic acid derivates (mainly benzoic acid and benzyl benzoate) and a mixture of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (typical components were α-, β-, and γ-eudesmols). Only two samples (PR-LS6 and PR-GR) contained low amount of benzoic acid derivates. Moreover, in PR-GR, concentration of sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons (mainly
