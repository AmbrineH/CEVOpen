<p class="p">Black poplars buds exhibited different EOs profile, differing in both quality and quantity. Some buds contained mainly oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (83% in PN3 and 86% in PN5; large amount of α-, β- and γ-eudesmols), while two other samples were mainly composed of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (73% in PN1 and 66% in PN2; main components were 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>- and γ-curcumens and δ-cadinen). PN4, PN6 and PN7 showed a different profile, containing a mix of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids (45% in PN4, 32% in PN6, and 40% in PN7) and derivates of benzoic acid (49% in PN4, 54% in PN6 and 48% in PN7, mainly prenyl benzoate).
