<p class="p">Aspen buds also exhibited different profiles of EOs. Four aspens contained mostly benzoic acid derivates (69% in PT4, 55% in PT1 and 51% in PT5). In PT1, benzyl benzoate was the main component (45.45%), while composition of PT4 and PT5 was more complex. Another pattern of composition was observed in PT2 and PT3, which contained mainly sesquiterpene derivates (91% in PT2 and 92% in PT3). EOs of PT2 were composed of similar amount of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (

In the case of the last sample, PT6, a different type of EOs profile was observed:a mixture of 2-phenylethanol, unidentified aliphatic component, benzyl alcohol and eugenol.
