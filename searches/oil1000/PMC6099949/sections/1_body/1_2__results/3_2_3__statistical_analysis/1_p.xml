<p class="p">Principal component analysis of 70EE has shown that a nine-principal-component model explained 99.3% of total variance, while 99.2% of total variance of EOs PCA analysis required a thirteen-principal-component model. Models limited to only two most important principal components explained 75.4% of 70EE total variance and 58.5% of EOs total variance. When poplars and aspens were excluded from analysis, the explanations of total variance were higher for two-component models (91.5% for 70EE and 79.2% for EOs).</p>
