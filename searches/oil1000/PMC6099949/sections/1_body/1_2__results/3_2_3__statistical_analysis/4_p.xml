<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01262-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 70EE samples may be divided in several groups (
 <italic class="italic">P. nigra</italic> buds and black poplar propolis, mixed aspen–black poplar propolis and 
 <italic class="italic">P. tremula</italic> buds). It is significant that propolis samples were separated according to the plant origin (black poplar propolis or mixed aspen–poplar bee glue). Conversely, for EOs, propolis samples could not be divided according to plant origins and were separated according to their main chemical components. Moreover, some black poplars and aspens samples were close to each other. In PCA of EOs, black poplars samples reflect similar distribution to each other such as in PCA of 70EE (PN1 and PN2 created one sub-cluster; PN3 and PN5 created the second sub-cluster; and PN4, PN6 and PN7 created the third sub-cluster). In the case of propolis and aspen samples, their own clusters were not preserved in PCA of EOs (see
