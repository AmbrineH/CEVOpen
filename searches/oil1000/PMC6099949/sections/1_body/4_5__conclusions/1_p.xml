<p class="p">Our work has proven that 70EE of propolis is better for identifying propolis plant origins compared to EOs because of the presence of specific plant precursors’ markers in 70EE and a general lack of specific markers in EOs. Some black poplar and aspen buds exhibited differences in EOs and 70EE composition. Among those, higher variability in 
 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> buds EOs than 70EE was observed. For these reasons, polyphenols may be the component which determines bees’ selection of plant material collection for propolis. EOs may however play a role as a secondary attractant.
