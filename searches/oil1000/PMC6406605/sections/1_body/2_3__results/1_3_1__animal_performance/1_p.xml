<p class="p">The growth performance results and slaughter traits over the entire experiment are presented in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00033-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The average live weight of animals at the beginning of the experiment was 28.2 ± 1.8 kg, and the average slaughter weight was 48.5 ± 3.5 kg. As expected, there were no differences in initial weight (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) among the three dietary treatment groups. Significant differences attributable to the different dietary treatments were observed in the daily weight gain during both fattening phases. The live weight at the end of Fattening Phase I tended to be higher in Groups B and BL than in Group P (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.054). Groups B and BL had faster daily gain than Group P in both Fattening Phase I (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.062), Fattening Phase II (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and over the entire experiment (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The differences in gain between the grain-supplemented Groups B and BL and the grazing Group P were 30.3 and 29.4 g/day, respectively. Moreover, at slaughter, bucks from Groups B and BL were 5.2 and 4.5 kg heavier on average, respectively, than Group P animals (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The grain-fed deer (Groups B and BL) produced carcasses that were 5.4 and 4.8 kg heavier, respectively, with higher dressing-out proportions (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) than the pasture-fed (Group P) animals. However, the addition of lysine to the barley had no significant effect on any of the growth or carcass dress-out proportions when compared with barley supplementation alone. Barley supplementation resulted in a marked increase in the proportion of internal fat, which was nearly 2.5-fold higher in Group B than in Group P (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Group BL had a significantly lower proportion of internal fat (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than Group B but a significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) higher proportion than Group P.
