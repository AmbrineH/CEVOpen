<p class="p">Although the differences in most color parameters of the muscles were not significant, the tendency in color was similar. Diet appeared to have a significant effect on the redness (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>*) and yellowness (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>*) parameters of the LL muscle, with more intensely red and yellow meat in Group B than in Group P (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively). The highest values of saturation index (chroma) were observed in the LL muscle from Group B (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
