<p class="p">The weights, pH values, Warnerâ€“Bratzler shear force and color parameters measured in LL and SET muscles of FD bucks are presented in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00033-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. None of the physical components differed significantly except where stated. The supplemented diets resulted in heavier LL muscles in Groups B and BL compared with Group P (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas no apparent effect of diet (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.472) on the weight of the SET muscle was observed among the individual groups. In addition, diet had no apparent effect on the pH
