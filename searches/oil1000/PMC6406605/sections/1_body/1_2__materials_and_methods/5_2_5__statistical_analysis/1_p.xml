<p class="p">All calculations were performed in the statistical package SAS [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Each variable was previously tested for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test and for homogeneity of variance with the Levene test. Data were analyzed with a mixed linear model, and parameters were estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood method of the MIXED procedure. The statistical model involved the fixed effect of diet and the random effect of day of slaughter. The data in tables are presented as least squares means (LSM) and standard errors of the mean (SEM;
