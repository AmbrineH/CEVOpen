<p class="p">The experiment was terminated in October with the slaughtering of the bucks at an average age of 17 months. On each of three slaughter days (155, 169 and 183 days on feed, respectively), 15 animals (5 from each group) were randomly selected and stunned with a captive bolt within a handling box, weighed (slaughter weight—used for the calculation of slaughter characteristics), bled and eviscerated directly on the farm, and then transferred in a refrigerator truck to the experimental slaughterhouse of IAS for further processing. The weights of internal fat depots (the sum of the kidney, rumen and scrotal fat) were recorded. Within 5 h after slaughter, the carcasses were uniformly dressed and divided into two halves, and the carcass weights were taken. The dressing-out proportion was calculated as: (carcass weight/slaughter weight) × 100.</p>
