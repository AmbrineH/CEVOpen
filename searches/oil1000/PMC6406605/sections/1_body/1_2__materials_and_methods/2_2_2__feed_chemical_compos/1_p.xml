<p class="p">The average chemical compositions of the barley and pasture are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00033-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. During the experiment, forage samples were collected three times from three locations within each paddock (end of April, beginning of August, and October). All diet samples were freeze-dried (Freeze dryer ALPHA 1–4 LSC, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany), and the average nutrient composition was analyzed as described by Jančík et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The chemical composition of pasture was determined according to the following methods: dry matter: oven drying for 6 h at 105 °C to a constant weight; ash: oven drying for 6 hat 550 °C; crude fat: extraction for 6 h with petroleum-ether using Soxtec 1043 (FOSS Tecator AB, Höganäs, Sweden); nitrogen: Kjeldahl method (Kjeltec AUTO 1030 Analyser, Höganäs, Sweden) according to AOAC 976.05 [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]; crude protein: calculated as N × 6.25; acid detergent fiber (ADF) and lignin: determined according to AOAC 973.18 [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]; and neutral detergent fiber (NDF): analyzed in the presence of sodium sulfite and with α-amylase [
