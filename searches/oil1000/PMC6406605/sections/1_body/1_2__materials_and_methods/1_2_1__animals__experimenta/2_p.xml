<p class="p">The groups were assigned to three different dietary treatments. Group P received only pasture, Group B received pasture supplemented with barley, and Group BL received pasture supplemented with barley mixed with lysine (LysiPEARL
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> at 5 g/day). The LysiPEARL
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> preparation (Kemin Industries, Inc., Des Moines, IA, USA) consisted of 50% of synthetic lysine and 50% hydrolyzed palm oil and provided lysine in encapsulated form (RPAA). The encapsulation protected the lysine from rumen microorganisms and ensured its release in the abomasum. Supplementation was performed once daily via wooden troughs placed in the pasture. One meter of trough length was available for each animal. All groups received a mineral mixture lick (Premin Slanisko, VVS Verměřovice Ltd., Verměřovice, Czech Republic). The finishing period was divided into two phases. In the first phase (90 days from the end of April until the end of July; Summer), the B and BL groups received barley in the amount of 0.2 kg/day/animal, whereas, in the second phase (on average 79 days, from the beginning of August until slaughter in October; Autumn), the dose of barley was increased to 0.4 kg/day/animal. Group BL received the same amount of lysine (5 g/day/animal) over the entire experiment.
