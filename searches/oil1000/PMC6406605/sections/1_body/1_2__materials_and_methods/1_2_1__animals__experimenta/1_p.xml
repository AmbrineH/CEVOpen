<p class="p">All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute of Animal Science (IAS; IACUC No. 60444/2011-MZE-17214). A total of 45 FD bucks at an initial age of 11 months and an average live weight of 28.2 ± 1.8 kg were utilized. The animals were fattened during 2015 on the Mnich farm near Kardašova Řečice situated in the South Bohemian Region (49°16′71.9″ N; 14°90′05.2″ E). All animals originated from the same herd. Individual bucks were identified with plastic ear tags and, based on their body weights, were assigned to three separate groups of 15 animals housed in three 2-ha adjoining paddocks. The bucks were weighed three times (until the onset of fraying) during the experiment, and paddocks were switched among the groups at six-week intervals.</p>
