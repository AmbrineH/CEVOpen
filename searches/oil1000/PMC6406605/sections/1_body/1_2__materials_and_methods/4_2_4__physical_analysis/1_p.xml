<p class="p">pH readings were obtained using a puncture probe (SenTix Sp) connected to a pH 3310 m (WTW, Weilheim, Germany) at 96 h 
 <italic class="italic">post-mortem</italic> in the LL and SET samples these pH
 <sub class="sub">96h</sub> readings were considered the ultimate pH values (pH
 <sub class="sub">u</sub>). Instrumental color was measured on LL and SET samples 96 h 
 <italic class="italic">post-mortem</italic> using a portable spectrophotometer (CM-2500d, Minolta, Osaka, Japan; aperture size of 8 mm including the specular component and 0% UV; illuminant/observer of D65/10°; zero and white calibration). The results were expressed by the 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>* (lightness), 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* (redness) and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* (yellowness) co-ordinates of the CIELab colorimetric space [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Three measurements per sample distributed on the muscle cross-section surface were taken after 30 min of air exposure to allow blooming, and an effort was made by the operator to avoid areas of dense connective tissue or fat. The 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* values were subsequently used to calculate chroma (
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>*), saturation index = (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>*
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> + 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>*
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>)
 <sup class="sup">0.5</sup> and hue angle (°) = tan
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>*/
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>*). The mean values of the three measurements of each attribute were determined for each muscle from each animal, and these values were used for statistical analyses.
