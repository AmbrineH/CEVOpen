<p class="p">Shear force was measured in cooked samples of LL and SET muscles that had been previously aged for 14 days (within whole carcass halves for the first four days and then vacuum-packed in plastic bags and aged at +4 °C for an additional 10 days). The samples were removed from the vacuum packaging and cut into 20-mm thick-steaks. The steaks were cooked on a double-glass/ceramic-plate grill (VCR 6l TL, Fiamma, Aveiro, Portugal) preheated to 200 °C until an internal temperature of 70 °C was reached, as determined by a digital temperature probe (AD14TH, Ama-Digit, Kreuzwerheim, Germany). The cooked samples were subsequently cooled to 4 °C and the center of each steak was divided into four rectangular blocks (20 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm) by cutting perpendicular to the muscle fiber direction. Care was taken to ensure that no visible connective tissue was included in the core. The peak force required to shear the samples across the fibers was recorded using an Instron Universal Texture Analyzer 3365 (Canton, MA, USA) fitted with a V-shaped Warner–Bratzler (WB) shear blade running at a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min. The maximum mean force in newtons (N) required to shear through the sample was based on at least nine measurements for each muscle from each animal.</p>
