<p class="p">The differences between Groups B and BL and thus the effect of RPAA lysine on growth performance were smaller in magnitude. These results are broadly in agreement with those of Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], who reported no effect of lysine supplementation (crude protein-deficient diets with 3 g/kg lysine, 3 g/kg lysine + 1 g/kg methionine, and 3 g/kg lysine + 2 g/kg methionine) on growth performance in sika deer. Similarly, Hussein and Berger [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and Klemesrud et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] found no significant differences in performance responses to supplemental RPAA lysine in cattle.
