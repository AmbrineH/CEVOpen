<p class="p">Barley-supplemented animals clearly showed greater daily live weight gain during the entire experimental period, in agreement with previous reports of positive effects of concentrates on growth performance compared with pasture-fed deer [

 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Diet was a significant source of variation of daily weight gain, particularly during the second fattening phase, during which Groups B and BL received a double dose of barley (0.4 kg/day per animal) and extreme drought conditions during the summer months resulted in inadequate pasture capacity. During this period, Groups B and BL had greater weight gain than the pasture-fed deer (Group P). Bovolenta et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] also reported higher growth rates for FD supplemented with concentrates compared with those only grazing pasture. This difference was associated with the poor herbage allowance, which was not able to fully satisfy the nutritional requirements of the pasture-fed animals.
