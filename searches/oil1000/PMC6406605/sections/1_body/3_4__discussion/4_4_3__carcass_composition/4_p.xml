<p class="p">In the present study, concentrate feeding in the form of barley had a major impact on carcass fatness, with the highest amount and proportion of separable fat in Group B. This increase in carcass fatness with grain-based diets is consistent with the results of Volpelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] for FD and those of Phillip et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] for RD. Similar to the effects on internal fat depots, the addition of dietary lysine decreased both the amount and proportion of separable fat in barley-supplemented deer. The decrease in carcass fatness might be a concern as venison is valued for its low but favorable fat content, and this result indicates that RPAA lysine supplementation could reduce the total fatness of FD meat/muscle. The effect of lysine on muscle fatness and, in turn, organoleptic quality warrants further research.
