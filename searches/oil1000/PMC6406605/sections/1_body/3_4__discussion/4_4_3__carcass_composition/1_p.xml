<p class="p">Barley supplementation in Groups B and BL resulted in the production of higher amounts of meat, indicating improved muscle development. However, the total meat proportion did not differ significantly among the individual dietary treatments. The separable lean meat proportion was broadly within the range of 72.7â€“76% reported by Drew [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] for all farmed deer species younger than 26 months of age. Similarly, Volpelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] reported higher weights of lean meat for FD fed concentrates in a daily amount of 500 g of dry matter/animal (40% maize, 25% sugar beet pulp, 20% alfalfa, 13% soy flakes, and 2% mineral and vitamins) compared with FD grazing on herbage for four months. However, the opposite trend was observed by Phillip et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] in RD with slightly higher lean meat proportions in RD fed forage:concentrate at a 75:25 ratio than in those fed ratios of 50:50 and 25:75.
