<p class="p">As only minor differences in shear force values (meat tenderness) were observed in this study, it can be concluded that dietary treatment had no effect on the tenderness of FD meat. These results correspond with those reported for FD in Italy [

 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] reported significantly lower shear force values for meat samples from FD fed concentrates compared with those grazing pasture. Similar results were obtained by Hutchison et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] for FD in Australia. Supplementation with barley (800 g/animal/day) had an indirect effect on shear force values, and supplemented animals had a significantly higher IMF content and thus produced more tender meat than those with pasture fattening. It would be interesting to evaluate the effect of supplementary feeding on the chemical composition, particularly the IMF content, of FD fed supplementary barley during a very dry season like the one experienced in this investigation.
