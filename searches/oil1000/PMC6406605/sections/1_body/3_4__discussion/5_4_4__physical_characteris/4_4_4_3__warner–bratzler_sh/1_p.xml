<p class="p">Meat tenderness is highly variable among animal species as a result of various extrinsic and intrinsic factors and these differences are mainly described by proteolytic enzyme activity, collagen content, muscle fiber characteristics and the anatomical position of each muscle [

 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] also noted differences in tenderness among FD muscles, with the LL muscle classified as inherently tender. Our results are in broad agreement with these observations, although the comparison of muscles was not the subject of this study.
