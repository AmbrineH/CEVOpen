<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* value of meat is closely related to myoglobin content, whereas the 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* value is related to the redness and lightness of meat. In general, the greater the myoglobin content in meat, the higher the values of 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* [
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Significant differences were found between Groups P and B in the redness and yellowness of LL muscle. Since the 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* values are used to calculate chroma values, muscles with significantly higher 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>* and/or 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>* values will also have higher chroma values [
 <xref rid="B47-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], as observed in the LL muscle of Group B. Similarly, Vestergaard et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] reported higher redness, yellowness and chroma values in LL muscles of concentrate-fed bulls, although pigmentation was higher in bulls grazing pasture. Nevertheless, these color differences are probably primarily attributable to differences in physical activity rather than feeding level, as Group P likely spent more time foraging to consume sufficient feed, particularly during the dry period. This aspect of the effect of exercise on muscle color in FD warrants further evaluation.
