<p class="p">The meat from animals finished on pasture diets is usually darker than the meat from animals finished on concentrate diets [
 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Several factors are responsible for this difference, but pH and IMF appear to have the greatest impact. However, in this study, only minor differences in some color parameters were observed. Similarly, Volpelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], Mulley et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] and Hutchison et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] reported no significant effect of diet with or without concentrates on the color parameters of muscles from FD. A possible explanation, as proposed in a review [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], is that commonly farmed ruminants have higher levels of (visible) IMF, which reflects light and thus gives a lighter appearance (higher 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>* values). By contrast, cervids have low levels of IMF [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], even when fed supplements, and thus would not necessarily have statistically higher 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>* values when supplemented compared with pasture/forage rearing only.
