<p class="p">This experiment in FD bucks was performed with the aim of evaluating the effect of diet on the growth rates, carcass composition, and physical quality attributes as measured in two muscles. The bucks were reared under identical conditions, and all entered the experiment with similar average live weights. The animals were assigned to three different dietary treatment groups: P (pasture fattening), B (pasture fattening + barley supplementation) and BL (pasture fattening + supplementation with barley and RPAA lysine). Lysine was added as this essential amino acid is frequently insufficient in feed rations for ruminants [
