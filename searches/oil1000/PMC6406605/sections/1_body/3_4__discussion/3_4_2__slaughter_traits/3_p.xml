<p class="p">Notably, supplementation of FD with lysine (Group BL) significantly decreased internal fat and carcass fat proportions in this study. Lipogenesis inhibition and repartitioning of nutrients towards lean tissue deposition rather than fat deposition as a result of increasing dietary lysine levels have been reported in broilers [
