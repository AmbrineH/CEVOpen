<p class="p">Given the increases in the popularity of deer farming and the accessibility of venison for the average consumer, the outcomes of this study are important for the assessment of the marketing quality of farmed FD. Supplementation with concentrates in the form of barley was an effective nutritional strategy to enhance the growth, performance and carcass yield of FD bucks in this study. This strategy led, however, to increases in internal and carcass fat content. Although the addition of RPAA lysine to the barley-supplemented diet decreased the total fatness of the FD, internal fat remained higher than that of FD reared on pasture alone. Further research is required to determine whether supplementation with lysine or other AAs could also improve other attributes of venison, which consumers consider a healthy alternative to traditional types of meat. By contrast, diet appeared to have a less pronounced effect on some of the physical parameters of LL muscle and no effect on the physical aspects of SET muscle. The pH
 <sub class="sub">u</sub> values indicated no incidence of DFD meat, and color parameters were generally desirable for venison derived from FD. While effects of the different feed rations on the performance, carcass traits and physical attributes of FD meat were observed, these diets might also result in differences in chemical composition and organoleptic properties.
