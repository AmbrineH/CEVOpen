<p class="p">Venison is often considered an “organic” and safe product, with health-promoting characteristics that make it attractive to consumers and support its place in the human diet [

 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Growth, carcass composition and meat quality are of the utmost importance when the economic value of an animal is evaluated. Worldwide, the fallow deer (
 <italic class="italic">Dama dama</italic>) (FD) is one of the most abundant deer species raised under farm conditions, but only a few studies have focused on dietary concentrate and AA supplementation in this species. Despite extensive efforts to measure and quantify the carcass traits and physical attributes of deer meat, only a few investigations have targeted FD, and therefore considerable information gaps remain. Moreover, there have been no studies of the potential effects of AA supplementation on carcass parameters or technological meat quality parameters. The present study therefore sought to compare the growth, carcass composition and physical quality traits of venison from farmed FD males fed different diets.
