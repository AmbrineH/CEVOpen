In general, deer fed/supplemented with concentrates had higher carcass weights and dressing-out proportions than animals grazing pasture. Moreover, feeding concentrates may also affect the proportions of anatomical joints and lean cuts, as well as the amount of separable fat, as reviewed by Kudrnáčová et al. [
