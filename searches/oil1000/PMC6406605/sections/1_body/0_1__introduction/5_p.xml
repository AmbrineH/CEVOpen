<p class="p">Carcass conformation, meat quality and quantity depend on the amount of muscle and skeletal tissue. The amounts of theses tissues are related to the accretion of muscle proteins whose deposition requires a dietary supply of amino acids (AAs). Lysine is an essential AA that serves as a building block for protein biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Previous research has mostly focused on the importance of lysine in the diets of monogastric animals, such as pigs or poultry [

 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, since the identification of lysine as one of the top limiting AAs for ruminants, research has expanded to include polygastric animals [

 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Thus, ruminants have higher metabolizable protein requirements that may exceed their supply [

 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Microbial protein breakdown and synthesis result in alterations of AAs from the animalâ€™s diet upon absorption in the gut [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. It is therefore essential to provide these AAs in a resistant/protected form that can withstand microbial degradation in the rumen and ensure availability in the abomasum. These preparations, referred to as rumen-protected amino acids (RPAAs), can be efficiently utilized by ruminants and thus potentially improve growth performance and carcass composition [
