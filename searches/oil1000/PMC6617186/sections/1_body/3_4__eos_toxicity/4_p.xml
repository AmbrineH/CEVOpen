<p class="p">Although extensive research has been carried out on the antibiotic potential of EOs, there are a few studies elucidated their interaction with nucleic acids. The available studies show that there are two phenomena. At first, genoprotective effect against xenobiotics when EOs have been shown to prevent DNA mutations and aberrations [

 <italic class="italic">Origanum compactum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia herba alba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum camphora</italic> EOs. The primary outcomes of the study suggested that EOs alone caused slight mutations in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus. In combination with mutagenic agents (UVB and 8-methoxypsoralen) plus UVA radiation and methylmethane sulfonate, cytoplasmic mutations and mitochondria damage were strictly increased, but nuclear DNA showed no mutagenic changes in combination with genotoxic treatment and EOs [
