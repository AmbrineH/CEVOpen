<p class="p">Toxicity assessment is complicated by the high variability of the active substance content, which can be up to hundreds in one type of oil [
 <xref rid="B71-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Only a few articles found proposed mechanisms of toxicity. In general, the mechanisms of the cytotoxic effect of EOs are the production of ROS, blockade of sodium channels (e.g., for thymol 150 µM IC50, skeletal muscle cells), cell cycle disruption, mitochondrial damage, DNA aberration, and initialization of NF-kB cascade leading to apoptosis induction [
 <xref rid="B72-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Studies conducted on spermatozoa confirmed that the most sensitive to the dose of EOs is sperm motility, and membrane integrity was minimally affected with a dose of 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> EOs at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL [

 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> and

 <xref rid="B75-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Another toxicological investigation has shown an interesting effect that EOs components in 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> (α-pinene, camphene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, camphor, borneol, bornyl acetate, α-humulene, viridiflorol, humulene epoxide II, and manool) may exhibit dualistic pharmacological properties. The capability of both neurotransmitter excitatory and inhibition mechanisms in the control of anxiety [
 <xref rid="B76-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Atsumi et al. has shown that the molecular structure plays a role in the toxicity of the active ingredients. Eugenol, the major component of clove EOs, shows much higher cytotoxic effects in its isoform [
 <xref rid="B77-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Moreover, the toxic effects of EOs could be also given by minor ingredients, rather than the most abundant compounds [
