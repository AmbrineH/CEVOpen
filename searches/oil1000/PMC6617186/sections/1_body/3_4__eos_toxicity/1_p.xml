<p class="p">More recently, literature has emerged that offers contradictory findings of the toxicity of EOs in vitro and in vivo. The discussed health risk includes effects such as respiratory disorders, skin sanitiser, carcinogens, reproductive toxicity, or organ toxicity. In this context, the risk assessment should be taken into account; risk identification, dose-response evaluation, time of exposure, and mechanism of toxicity. The first phase of testing includes in vitro cytotoxicity tests of potentially harmed tissues. Subsequently, the tested substances could be applied in an organism.</p>
