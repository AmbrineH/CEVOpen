<p class="p">Compared to antibiotics, EOs are tolerable at higher doses. In general, LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for antibiotics ranges from units up to hundreds of mg/kg for acute administration. The sub-acute toxicity of most antibiotics brings a number of side effects affecting important internal organs. In addition, the discharging of the intestinal microbiota and the resistance of pathogenic microorganisms is still an unsurpassed negative side. Despite the enormous potential of EOs to serve as antibiotic admixtures or feeds, the Guidelines of the Scientific Committee on Food for Safety Assessment (EFSA, 2016) recommend genotoxicity and subchronic studies at the core of tests.
