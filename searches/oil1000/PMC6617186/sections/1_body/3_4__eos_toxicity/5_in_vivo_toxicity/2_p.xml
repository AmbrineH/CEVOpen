<p class="p">In addition to actual toxicity, sub-chronic doses have been monitored. During the 90-day administration of carvacrol/thymol (10:1) at doses of 5, 100 and 200 mg/kg b.w./day, no animals died or showed deviations from the control group. The monitored parameters were overall health state, weight, feed consumption, blood count and histopathological findings. Only glucose levels were decreased, and females had enlarged ovaries in the treated group. The similar results were obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus eldarica</italic> EOs in the dose 125 and 250 mg/kg for 28 days and 
 <italic class="italic">Satureja khuzestanica</italic> in the dose for 14 days 0.2â€“0.6 mL/kg [
