<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are natural extracts, whose origin is folk medicine. In general, their use is eco-friendly, non-toxic and consistent with nature. Todayâ€™s scientific research on EO efficiency is based on different traditional healing systems all over the world. Many preclinical studies have documented antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. Except for the known toxic ingredients, EOs are considered generally regarded as safe (GRAS) in mammals [

EOs are unique in that each type differs in the composition of active substances and their concentrations. Currently, approximately 3000 substances in EOs have been identified. The chemical composition of EOs depends on the ambient conditions of plant growth and genetic diversity, which makes it difficult for exploration and commercial exploitation [
