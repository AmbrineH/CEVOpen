<p class="p">Recently, EOs has become an alternative to antibiotics in animal feed. Partly to prevent the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms, but also through the legislative restriction of the frequent use of zinc medication doses [

In several in vitro and in vivo studies, it could be found that extracts from rosemary, oregano, dill, cinnamon, eucalyptus, garlic, clove, or thyme were able to modulate ruminal methane emission to various extents, primarily by acting on methanogenic microflora [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The mechanisms of action have been summarized in many review articles [
