<p class="p">As a result of the global increase in the demand for antibiotics, EOs are continually being tested for their antimicrobial effects. Several methods for their production have been invented as well as measures to eliminate the extraction of antinutritional or toxic substances contained in natural flavours. Development and research are also growing in the field, for their use in controlling pathogens, or their pharmacological use. The weakness of this research is so far insufficient information about their metabolism in the organism. Some hydrophilic oil components are already absorbed in the stomach, whereas lipophilic oils can pass to the intestine where their site of action is most predicted. The chemical nature of some active substances predisposes them to interactions with other food ingredients and thereby deteriorating their availability. Encapsulation and the use of nanotechnologies seem very promising in this direction. Speculation also leads to their toxicity. Because they are considered GRAS, there is no attempt to investigate their harmful effects on the body, which can cause adverse reactions to organisms. EOs are a considerable issue that needs to be explored in broader contexts and involving more disciplines.</p>
