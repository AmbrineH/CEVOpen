<p class="p">Due to the EOs complexity, more recent attention has been focused on the choice of extraction procedure that could affect their yield and character. Currently, conventional methods (hydrodistillation, steam distillation, hydro diffusion, and solvent extraction) are alternated by green and sustainable extraction procedures. Benefits include shorter extraction times, lower energy consumption, low solvent usage, and less carbon dioxide emissions [

 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Comparative studies of the extraction of various oils confirmed the high variability in the composition of the extracted substances that results in their varied effectiveness. The differences in extraction yield are mainly influenced by physicochemical parameters (temperature, time, pH, extraction dynamics), by the technique used or by the inclusion of other steps, such as ohmic heating, the assistance of ultrasound, or ionic liquids [
