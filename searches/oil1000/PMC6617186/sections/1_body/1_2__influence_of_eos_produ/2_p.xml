<p class="p">Factors found to be influencing EOs composition during storage have been explored in several studies. Notably, the exposure to EOs to atmospheric oxygen and UV radiation is one of the major causes of chemical change leading to loss of their efficiency [

 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that some phenolic components of EOs are oxidized by contact with reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing very reactive phenoxyl radicals. These types of radical reactions are enhanced by the presence of transition metal ions, such as Fe

Although results have confirmed an increase in antioxidant activity, there were reduced antibacterial effects due to changing certain active substances caused by gamma radiation [
