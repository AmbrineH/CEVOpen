<p class="p">An understanding of the pharmacokinetics of EOs in the organism is critical for consideration its effectivity and toxicity. The main obstacle to use EOs as an animal antibiotic is that the active substances enter the intestines at a concentration that is less than inhibitory. Commercial preparations often offer complex mixtures with bonded EOs or the oils are mixed into feed rations. During the digestion process, the individual active substances of EOs are degraded and metabolized. Generally, the kinetics of this process is based on the EOs composition.</p>
