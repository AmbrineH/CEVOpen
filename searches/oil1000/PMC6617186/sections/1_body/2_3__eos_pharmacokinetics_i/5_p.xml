<p class="p">A major proportion of EOs compounds are eliminated by renal excretion, as evidenced by an increase in urine analytes [

Some studies have reported that the highest concentration of active compounds from EOs is two hours after administration, and after five hours, the substances have been already effectively eliminated from the bloodstream. For example, the half-life of carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, and trans-cinnamaldehyde ranged between 1.84 and 2.05 h, whereas trans-cinnamaldehyde showed the fastest disappearance [
