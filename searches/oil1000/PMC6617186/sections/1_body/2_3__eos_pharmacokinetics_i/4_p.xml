<p class="p">Hydrophilic EOs components (polyphenols, flavones, flavanols, lignans, aromatic acids) are generally bonded to saccharides. These glycosides are metabolised in the small intestine, and their ligands are accessible to enterocytes. Non-absorbed aglycones metabolic pathway passes through the liver, where it is absorbed, and subjected to enzymatic degradation. Besides digestive processes, anthocyanins, isoflavones, tannins metabolism depends on their chemical nature (such as glycosylation) and intestinal microbiota [
