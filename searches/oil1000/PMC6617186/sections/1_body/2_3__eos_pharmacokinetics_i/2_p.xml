<p class="p">EOs are complex mixtures of organic compounds including volatile compounds (such as monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and their oxygenated derivatives) and of non-volatile residues (such as hydrocarbons, fatty acids, sterols, carotenoids, waxes and flavonoids) [
 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00352" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The solubility of the individual active substances has the greatest effect on absorption in the organism. In the gastrointestinal tract, the EOs compounds tend to interact with digested food. As a result, active substances could escape to solubilization and adsorption in the stomach. Moreover, the kinetics rate depends on the activity of digestive enzymes to release the EOs components from the fatty acid bonds [
