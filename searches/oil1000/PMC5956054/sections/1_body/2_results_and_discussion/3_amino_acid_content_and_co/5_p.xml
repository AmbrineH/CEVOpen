<p id="Par45" class="p">Although it is well known that peeling and pearling significantly decrease the nutritional value of staple grains (e.g. wheat) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], the effects of these processes on the nutritional value of pseudocereals and oil seed plants have not been characterized. For that reason, one aim of the present study was to evaluate whether peeling or pearling alters the AA content and composition of quinoa, buckwheat and oil hemp seeds. The results are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> as AA tot and EAA tot in g/100Â g DW. According to the results, AAs in pseudocereals (quinoa and buckwheat) are concentrated in the outer shell of the seed. Pearling significantly reduced the AA tot in quinoa, as well as EAA tot. In addition, AA tot and EAAs seemed to be concentrated in the bran of buckwheat. However, in oil hemp seed the opposite phenomenon was observed: oil hemp peel contained less AA tot than the whole oil hemp seed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). In summary, the results show evidently that, processing requires thorough attention regarding the raw material to preserve the protein quality in the final consumer product.
