 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. All the seeds studied were rich sources of major minerals (Ca, K, Mg, P, S) and trace elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) compared to whole grain cereal flours [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Superior sources of major minerals were buckwheat bran, rapeseed press cake, hempseed, flaxseed and faba bean. Only pearled quinoa had a lower mineral content than whole grain cereals. In the pearling process about 40% of the outer layer of quinoa seed is discarded causing 50–90% decrease in mineral elements concentratios. The largest decreases were in Mn, P, Mg and K concentrations. This reduces the value of quinoa as a source of essential minerals. However, the lower mineral concentrations in pearled quinoa may be compensated for by better absorption, due to the lower phytic acid and saponin contents [
