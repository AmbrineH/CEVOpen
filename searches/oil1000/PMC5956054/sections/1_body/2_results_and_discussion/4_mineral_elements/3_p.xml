<p id="Par48" class="p">Cd is a toxic heavy metal. In EU regulation N:o 1881/2006, the maximum residue level for Cd in cereals is 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.2 mg/kg for bran, embryos, wheat and rice. There were no maximum residue levels for Cd in oil crops or pseudocereals. Cd content was highest in flaxseed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Flaxseed is known to accumulate cadmium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. The Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira) has recommended using only 2 spoonfuls of flaxseed per day, while bread can contain 10% of flaxseed. Buckwheat bran contained 3 times more Cd than dehulled buckwheat. Whole faba bean contained 3 times higher Cd concentrations than hulled and grinded faba bean. However, there were no large differences in Cd contents between pearled and whole quinoa and oil hemp hulls and seeds. This suggests that Cd might be relatively evenly distributed in the whole grain.
