<p id="Par34" class="p">All analyses were performed at least duplicated or triplicated. The results of the samples obtained from various sample suppliers are expressed as means and SD. One-way analysis of variance was fitted to the data. LSD was calculated for pairwise comparisons. If the difference between two samples is higher than LSD, the difference is statistically significant at 5% level. Because of imbalance of sample sizes, LSD will vary between comparisons. Median LSD was reported (=typically LSD for comparison where sample with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1 was compared to sample where 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3). SAS 9.3. was used to fit the model (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA).
