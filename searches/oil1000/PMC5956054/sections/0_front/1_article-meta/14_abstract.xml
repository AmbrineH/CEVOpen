 <p id="Par1" class="p">The goal of this work was to analyze nutritional value of various minimally processed commercial products of plant protein sources such as faba bean (
  <italic class="italic">Vicia faba</italic>), lupin (
  <italic class="italic">Lupinus angustifolius</italic>), rapeseed press cake (
  <italic class="italic">Brassica rapa/napus</italic> subsp. 
  <italic class="italic">Oleifera</italic>), flaxseed (
  <italic class="italic">Linum usitatissimum</italic>), oil hemp seed (
  <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic>), buckwheat (
  <italic class="italic">Fagopyrum esculentum</italic>), and quinoa (
  <italic class="italic">Chenopodium quinoa</italic>). Basic composition and various nutritional components like amino acids, sugars, minerals, and dietary fiber were determined. Nearly all the samples studied could be considered as good sources of essential amino acids, minerals and dietary fiber. The highest content of crude protein (over 30 g/100 g DW) was found in faba bean, blue lupin and rapeseed press cake. The total amount of essential amino acids (EAA) ranged from 25.8 g/16 g N in oil hemp hulls to 41.5 g/16 g N in pearled quinoa. All the samples studied have a nutritionally favorable composition with significant health benefit potential. Processing (dehulling or pearling) affected greatly to the contents of analyzed nutrients.
