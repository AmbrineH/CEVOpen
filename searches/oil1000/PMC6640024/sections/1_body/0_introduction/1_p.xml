<p class="p">An extensive transmission of 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> between humans is known to be significantly attributed to asymptomatic carriers. The percentage of persistent carriers of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureu</italic>s in anterior nares is reckoned to be about 20%, whereas the transient nasal carriers and non-carriers account for 60% and 20%, respectively. The persistent carrier-state is being more frequently observed among young children than adults; however the incidence of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> carriage among listed groups undergoes numerous changes in individuals aged between 10 and 20 [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Higher rates of nasal colonization are observed in hospital staff (around 44%), which doubtlessly poses a great risk of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> transmission to hospitalized patients [
