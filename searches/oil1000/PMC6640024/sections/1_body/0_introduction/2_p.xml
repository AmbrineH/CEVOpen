<p class="p">The carriage of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> among medical staff represents an outstanding problem because these can transfer multidrug staphylococcal strains to medical students, other medical staff, and, most importantly, to hospitalized patients. It is estimated that the nasal carriage of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> among medical staff ranges between 16.8% and 56.1% [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Nasal colonization with 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> is a risk factor for endogenous staphylococcal infection, especially in patients undergoing surgical procedures with simultaneously reduced immunity. Thus, the eradication is needed in carriers to reduce the risk of infection.
