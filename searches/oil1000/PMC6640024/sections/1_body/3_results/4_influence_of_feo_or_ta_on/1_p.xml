<p class="p">A significant increase in antistaphylococcal activity of MUP combined with FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A was confirmed by the agar dilution method and E-test method. The influence of FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A used in combination with MUP was comparable. MICs of MUP combined with FEO and MUP combined with 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A were &lt; 0.064 µg/ml for 79.1% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and 86.0% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> isolates, respectively. However, MICs of MUP without FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A were 0.19–0.125 µg/ml for 69.8% of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains. The addition of FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A to MHA reduced MIC values from 0.17 ±0.07 µg/ml to 0.064 µg/ml (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), but the largest number of isolates (34 and 37 strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, respectively for FEO and 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A) were inhibited by a concentration lower than 0.064 µg/ml (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). No correlation was found between resistance phenotypes and susceptibility towards MUP with FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A combinations (
