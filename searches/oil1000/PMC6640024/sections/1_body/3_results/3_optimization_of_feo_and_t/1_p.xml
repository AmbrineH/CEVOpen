<p class="p">The optimal concentrations of FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A, enhancing the activity of MUP against reference 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strain were 0.75% for FEO and 1.5% for 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A. It was observed that the addition of FEO and 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A to MHA with 1% Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80 decreased the MIC of MUP from 0.25 µg/ml to ≤ 0.064 µg/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The minimal concentration of MUP combined with 0.75% FEO and 1.5% 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A (which has been recognized to inhibit the growth of reference strain), was lower than 0.064 µg/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). It was also noted that the addition of 1% Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80 had no impact on the MIC value of MUP alone.
