<p class="p">According to the available data, the increase in resistance among 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B antibiotics is being observed [
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The presence of MLS
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> resistance mechanism among staphylococci excludes treatment with the above-mentioned antibiotics, while it is known that erythromycin and clindamycin are commonly used in empirical treatment of Gram-positive bacteria infections. Clindamycin is an alternative therapeutic option for the treatment of staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections, but also an alternative for patients with penicillin allergies [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The degree of resistance to macrolides among MRSA is still increasing, as well in MSSA, and this constitutes a significant challenge for clinicians dealing with skin infections [
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. According to the study of Yilmaz 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., the inducible MLS
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> resistance phenotype was detected in 14.8% of MSSA isolates [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Similar results were obtained by Prabhu 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., who reported that constitutive and inducible MLS
 <sub class="sub">B</sub> resistance phenotype among MSSA occurred in 18% of isolates from different clinical samples [
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Our results indicate that medical staff is a significant factor in the spread of pathogens resistant to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B antibiotics. Therefore, there is a need for continuous monitoring of this type of bacterial resistance and implementation of new methods to prevent the spread of resistance.
