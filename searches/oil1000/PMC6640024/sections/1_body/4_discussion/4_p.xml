<p class="p">Many scientific centres are investigating effective combinations of chemical agents as well as compounds of natural origin on decrease the resistance of microorganisms. Itaqui 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. investigated the interactions between azithromycin and terbinafine in combination with MUP in order to reduce the therapeutic doses of systemic and local treatment against 
 <italic class="italic">Pythium insidiosum</italic> responsible for ocular, cutaneous/subcutaneous, vascular and disseminated pythiosis [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Sato 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. found a synergistic effect of MUP and isoflavanone (Bidwillon B) obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Erythrina variegata</italic> against MRSA [
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The results showed that Bidwillon B appears to be not only a strong antistaphylococcal agent itself, but also combined with MUP, and thus can be helpful in the elimination of nasal and skin MRSA carriage. According to the findings of Kifer 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., some combinations of MUP and monoterpenes such as menthol, thymol, 1,8-cineole could be applied in the therapy of infections caused by 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus,</italic> including chronic rhinosinusitis [
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In this case, the treatment is based on bacterial biofilm growth prevention. Because of the common use of MUP for staphylococci eradication in patients and medical staff, there is a risk of a significant resistance rate increase in the future. The new active compounds acting additively or synergistically with MUP can be effective in prevention of the resistance to this antibiotic.
