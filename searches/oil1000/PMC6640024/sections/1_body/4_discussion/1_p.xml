<p class="p">The anethole-dominated FEO represents one of the two reference FEO chemotypes accepted by Pharmacopoeia for medical application [
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The content of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A in FEO ranges from 38.8% (Albania, Yugoslavia) to 84.1% (Turkey, Albania) and is dependent on its geographical origin. The content of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A in our tested FEO was close to French and Argentinean fennel oil; those contain 75.5% and 79.9% of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A, respectively [
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The European Pharmacopoeia (EP) requires minimum 60% of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A in bitter FEO composition. The remaining needed components are as follows: 15% of fenchone, 1–10% of α-pinene; not more than 6% of estragole and 1–5% of limonene. The chemical composition of the tested FEO was consistent with EP requirements regarding 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A, α-pinene, estragole and limonene. The content of fenchone was slightly lower when compared with reference data.
