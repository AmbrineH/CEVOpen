<p class="p">In our previous study we obtained promising results and indicated that FEO was the most effective in combination with MUP [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Using the disc diffusion method, the increasing zone of growth inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was found. We further decided to design an exact research using the agar dilution method and E-test method against higher number of isolates from nasal vestibule with different patterns of resistance. We studied not only the combination of FEO with MUP, but also the combination of FEO main component – 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A with MUP which, according to available data, improves cutaneous wound healing. This provides data on its oral LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values between 1.8–5.0 g for mice, rats and guinea pigs [
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. It can be concluded that antimicrobial activity of FEO compared with 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A is determined by more than one particular component, and depends on the synergistic activities of different oil constituents. This is even despite 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A high content. The MIC values of FEO were much lower than MICs of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A, ranging from 1.5 to 2.5% and from 3.0 to &gt; 4.0%, respectively. Summarizing, better results were obtained when combined FEO with MUP. The similar results were presented by Kazemi 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. in the study on antistaphylococcal activity of FEO containing mainly 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A, thymol, α-pinene, 1,8-cineole and fenchone [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. They found that analysed FEO was more effective against human pathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with MIC – 0.5 µg/ml than the main constituent – 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A itself (MIC – 4.0 µg/ml). Only pure thymol presented comparable activity to phenolic compounds of this oil. Lachowicz 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. showed the lesser antimicrobial activity of artificially prepared main constituent mixture (linalool-estragole) compared with anise oil [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. These results indicated that other less predominant components in anise oil most likely contribute to its antimicrobial activity.
