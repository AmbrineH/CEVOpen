<p class="p">Our investigation showed that FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A could be added to mupirocin-based agents to eradicate the nasal carriage of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and/or to limit the emergence of mupirocin resistance as well. The FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A combined with MUP tested in the study was effective against MLSB resistant 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> isolates and such combination/s may be helpful in nasal eradication of staphylococci with some patterns of resistance. This is not excluded, that in the coming future the FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A will be components of agents to mucous membranes antisepsis, but more research in this field are required.
