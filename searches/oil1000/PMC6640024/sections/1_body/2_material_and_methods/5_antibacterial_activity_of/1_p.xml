<p class="p">Antibacterial activity of MUP in combination with FEO or 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A was examined using the agar dilution method and E-test method in comparison with optimal concentrations revealed by optimization assay. For the screening of antibacterial activity of MUP combined with chemicals, the optimal concentration (v/v) of the chemicals was distributed in MHA with 1.0% (v/v) Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80. Plates were dried for 30 min at 37°C prior to inoculation with 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml of bacterial suspension. The activity of the antibiotic was studied by applying a plastic test strip (E-test) with a continuous and exponential gradient of MUP on the surface of MHA plates (with and without chemicals – control). The plates were incubated for 18 h at 37°C in aerobic conditions. The MIC values were calculated.
