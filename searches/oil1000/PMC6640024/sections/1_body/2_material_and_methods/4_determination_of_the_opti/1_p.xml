 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 29213™ strain of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. The optimization was performed using the agar dilution method and E-test method. For screening of the optimal concentrations of FEO and 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>A enhancing antibacterial activity of MUP, various concentrations (0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%) (v/v) of these chemicals were distributed into MHA with 1.0% (v/v) Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80. Plates were dried for 30 min at 37°C prior to inoculation with sterile cotton swab containing approximately 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml of microorganism. Then, the activity of the antibiotic was studied by applying a plastic test strip (E-test) which consisted a predefined, continuous and exponential gradient of MUP on the surface of MHA plates (with and without chemicals – control). The plates were incubated for 18 h at 37°C in aerobic conditions. After incubation, the MIC of MUP were calculated. Each test was performed with two replicates.
