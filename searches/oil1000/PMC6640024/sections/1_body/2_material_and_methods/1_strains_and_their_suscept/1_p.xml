 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains were isolated from medical faculties' students during the 2-years study, in the years 2014–2015 at Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine of Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Poland. During the study period, 43 bacterial strains from anterior nares swabs have been collected and routinely all were identified with 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> screening assay. The specimens were cultivated on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood (bioMérieux, Poland), identified by colony morphology, tube coagulase test (Biomed, Poland), Staph-Kit test (bioMérieux, Poland) and biochemical test GP Vitek 2 Compact (bioMérieux, Poland).
