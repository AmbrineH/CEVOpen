  <p class="p">
   <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> constitutes the most pathogenic species within the staphylococcal genus. Humans remain the major reservoirs of this pathogen which colonizes mostly anterior nares of healthy individuals.

  <title class="title">Aim</title>
  <p class="p">To investigate the effect of fennel essential oil (FEO) and 
   <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-anethole (
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>A) on antibacterial activity of mupirocin (MUP) against 
   <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains isolated from asymptomatic carriers.

  <title class="title">Material and methods</title>
  <p class="p">The content of the FEO was analysed with use of the GC-MS method. The research done on 43 
   <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> isolates with different resistance patterns, obtained from nasal vestibule. Antibacterial activity of MUP in combination with FEO or 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>A was examined using the agar dilution method and E-test method. The data analysis was done with the Pearson’s χ
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> test.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p class="p">The chemical composition of FEO was consistent with the European Pharmacopoeia (EP) for the main constituent – 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>A (77.9%) according to the EP recommendations. Macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance phenotype was prevalent among 39.5% of 
   <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> isolates. FEO concentrations of 2.0% and 2.5% revealed antibacterial activity against 76.7% of isolates, whereas 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>A inhibited 
   <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> growth at concentrations &gt; 4.0%. The MIC values for MUP combined with FEO as well as for MUP combined with 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>A were &lt; 0.064 µg/ml for 79.1% and 86.0% of 
   <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> isolates, respectively.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p class="p">Our experiment revealed FEO and 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>A influence on MUP effectiveness. The combination of MUP with FEO as well as MUP with 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>A are worth considering to implement in 
   <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> eradication procedures. These findings will be useful in designing efficient antistaphylococcal agents which can limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance.
