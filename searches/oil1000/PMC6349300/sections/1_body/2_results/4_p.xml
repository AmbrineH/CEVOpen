<p id="par0095" class="p">There were no statistically significant differences noticed between the R-75, R-30 and R-19 groups, but the apoptosis level tended to decrease in a R-75→R-30→R-19 row. R-75 rats had an apoptosis index of 17% and 21% (p &gt; 0.05) higher than those of R-30 and R-19 rats. Data analysis revealed that the apoptosis activity in all control groups was higher than reference values with differences were found between the C-75 and R-75, C-30 and R-30, C-19 and R-19 groups by 2% (p &gt; 0,05), 35% (p &gt; 0.05), and 277% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Apoptosis activity in E-75 group appeared to be 129% (p &lt; 0.05) higher than in C-75 group and 98% (p &lt; 0.05) and 23% (p &gt; 0.05) higher in E-30 and E-19 groups against C-30 and C-19 groups, respectively.
