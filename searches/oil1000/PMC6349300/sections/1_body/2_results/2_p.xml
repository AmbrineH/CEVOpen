<p id="par0085" class="p">Throughout the experiment, there was no indication of systemic condition deterioration of the animals. The animals of controls and exposure groups didn’t show any differences in external appearance. The rate of growth depended on the administered vitamins with the initial bodyweight of all groups starting at 85.6 ± 1.0 g, and ending at 403.4 ± 8.7, 378.7 ± 8.1 and 338.7 ± 7.7 g for the C-75, C-30 and C-19 groups and 373.4 ± 8.3, 352.0 ± 7.0 and 326.9 ± 8.7 g for the exposed groups, E-75, E-30 and E-19 respectively. The noticeable difference between the groups reached 7% (E-75:C-75), 7% (E-30:C-30) and 4% (E-19:C-19) by the end of the study. Feed intake didn't differ between control and exposure groups, but only between groups with the varied essential substances levels, where the feed intake had a tendency to decrease (C-75→C-30→C-19 row) from 18 g to 20 g and 22 g, respectively.</p>
