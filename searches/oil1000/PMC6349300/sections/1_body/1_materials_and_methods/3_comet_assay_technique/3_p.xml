<p id="par0070" class="p">Via a provided constant electric field in the agarose gel, damaged DNA particles migrate to the anode and form a "comet's tail", hence the name of this method, where the length and size of the comet depends on the degree of inflicted DNA damage (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Microscopic analysis was performed on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope at a magnification of 400 × . The images of DNA comets (SYBR Green I, S9430 Sigma-Aldrich) were analyzed using the software Comet Imager system, Metasystems GmbH. The percentage of DNA in the tail of comets (% of DNA in the tail) was used as an indicator of apoptotic cells. At least 100 cells were analyzed from each microsample. The results are represented as M ± m and min-max, where M stands for sample mean of measured data, m stands for the standard error, and min–max are the minimal and maximal values, as well as shares (percentage) or absolute figures.
