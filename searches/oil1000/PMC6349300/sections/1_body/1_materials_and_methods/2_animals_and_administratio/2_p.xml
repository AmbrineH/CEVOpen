<p id="par0050" class="p">One hundred and eighty male Wistar rats (weighing between 85.6 ± 1.0 g each) were used in this study. The animals were housed in plastic cages (2 per cage) with wood shavings in a steady heated (21 °C to 23 °C) air conditioned room with natural light settings. Modifications within the AIN-93 [

Rats were obtained from the Affiliated Unit "Stolbovaya" of Scientific Center for Biomedical Technology of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency. The animals were divided equally and randomly into 6 groups (3 control groups and 3 exposure groups) with the control groups (C-75, C-30, C-19) receiving AIN-93, a specific diet for rodents, consisting of a 75%, 30% and 19% ratio of vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6) and minerals (Fe3+ and Mg2+) and exposure groups (E-75, E-30, E-19) receiving the same diet paradigm as with the control groups but with the additional CCL4 (≥99.5%, 289116 Sigma-Aldrich) administered once a week as an olive oil solution (control groups received the same ratio of olive oil without CCL4) with each injection containing 0.81 g/kg body weight of CCl4 that corresponded to 1/8 of the LD50 [
