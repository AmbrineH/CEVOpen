<p id="par0120" class="p">Groups with a maximum (75%) content of essential substances demonstrated a more pronounced result, hence the importance of monitoring apoptosis activity indicators in regards to in vivo toxicological experiments when an optimal supply of vitamins and minerals are provided is proven. Furthermore, the stress from the regular intraperitoneal injections raised an apoptosis level in the liver, with a highest increase in rats suffering from an essential substances deficiency. In this case one of the principle mechanisms of apoptosis activation included a growing Ca2+/Mg2+ imbalance and disruption in the oxidation reactions regulation, intensifying the generation of free radicals [
