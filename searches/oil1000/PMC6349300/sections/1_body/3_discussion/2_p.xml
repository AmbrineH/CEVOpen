<p id="par0100" class="p">As seen in the presented data, when the absence of a stress factor exists, the rats with a reduced intake of vitamins B1, B2, B3 and B6 and minerals (Fe3+ and Mg2+) demonstrate a slight decrease regarding apoptosis activity. This is probably due to overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein genes initiated by vitamin deficiency [

The apoptosis activity analysis from the control and reference groups, which differed only in receiving or not intraperitoneal injections, suggests that stress triggered the apoptosis activation in animals of all control groups through both nervous and humoral regulatory mechanisms. As a result of this stress system activation, the cell membranes were depolarized by nerve impulses, forcing to open potential-dependent calcium channels and consequent delivery of extracellular Ca2+ to the cell. In the cytoplasm, Ca2+ links to the intracellular calmodulin receptor and activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, which initiates glycolysis mobilization, inhibits glycogen re-synthesis, and increases ATP and oxygen consumption, thus providing the stress adaptation [
