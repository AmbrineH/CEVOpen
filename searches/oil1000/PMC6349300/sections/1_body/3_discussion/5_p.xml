<p id="par0115" class="p">Apoptosis enhancement in exposure groups with exposure to CCl4 intoxication can be explained by the very nature of this toxicant metabolism by accumulating in the liver as a lipophilic hepatotropic compound, causing fatty degeneration and centrolobular necrosis. The damaging effect of CCl4 is associated with the development of oxidative stress, where in severe cases can lead to destruction of intracellular mitochondrial and lysosome membranes, release of hydrolytic lysosomal enzymes, protein denaturation and cell death [

It should be noted that CCl4 exposure enhanced the apoptosis activity, however a scale of differences between exposure and corresponding control groups was decreasing from 75% to 30% to 19%, an indication of a limited maximal apoptosis level in the organism. The regulation of programmed cell death processes is quite complex, has multiple stages and requires a considerable energy consumption. Therefore, in cases of overwhelming exposures, it might demand a lower need of resources for the organism to activate the necrosis mechanisms in order to shed the damaged cells [
