<p id="par0105" class="p">As a natural physiological antagonist of calcium ions, deficient Mg2+ in a diet deteriorates the intracellular Ca2+/Mg2+ balance and leads to the predominance of Ca2+ activating Ca2+-sensitive proteases and lipases, and damaging then the membranes. The Mg2+ deficiency formation in rats was confirmed by the results of the biochemical studies: Mg2+ content in the blood serum of control and exposure groups was ˜25%, 15% and 8% below the lower limit of the normal under conditions of 19%, 30% and 75% essential substances consumption, respectively. Since the groups did not differ in the level of stress exposure, the apoptosis activity growth against the essential substances reduction accounts for a growing Ca2+/Mg2+ imbalance in the first place. This hypothesis was supported by a apoptosis activity decrease in C-19→C-30→C-75 row, whereas the reference groups demonstrated a totally different trend, which assumes the prevailing stress and micro-element imbalance influence over the activity of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.</p>
