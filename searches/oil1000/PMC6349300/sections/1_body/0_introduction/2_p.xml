<p id="par0025" class="p">Vitamins and micronutrients have been extensively studied showing that when a deficiency of an essential substance exists, it can play a major role in following associated metabolic disorders [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In particular, iron is a component of cytochromes which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, as well as part of catalase, a key enzyme of the antioxidant defense system [

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Vitamins in the B group, which are cofactors of oxidoreductases, provide energy to all biochemical processes in the body, including the processes of maintaining an antioxidant status [

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Thus, taking into account just a few of the previously described examples of vitamin and micronutrient deficiency, it is important to discover new methods to clarify which exact parameters are to blame and how are they able to induce possible adverse effects.
