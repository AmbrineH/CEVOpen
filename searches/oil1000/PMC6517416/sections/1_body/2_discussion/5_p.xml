<p id="Par22" class="p">In summary, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil showed obvious fumigation and contact activity against the mycelial growth, conidial germination and sporulation of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>, and their primary active compound was 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde. The SEM observations revealed that the hyphae were shriveled and exfoliated after 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde treatment. The sporulation was significantly decreased after fumigation with 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde. This study demonstrated that cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils possess the potential to be used as a bio-fungicide to prevent and control RFS, and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde is a very promising natural lead compound for the discovery of high efficacy and low risk fungicides. Up till now it has not been reported that any plant essential oils can be used to prevent and control RFS in the greenhouse or fields. It is an important topic to evaluate the efficay of cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil against this disease in fields in further studies.
