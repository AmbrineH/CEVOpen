<p id="Par19" class="p">To explore the possible active constituent of cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil, the major components of cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil were analyzed, and its contact activity against mycelial growth and conidial germination was evaluated. The photographs of cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil and

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>. The results revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde was the most abundant compound in both cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils and had a higher inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth than that of cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils. Similarly, several research papers reported that the fungicidal activity of cinnamon oil on wood-rot fungi and plant pathogenic fungi was attributed to its primary component,
