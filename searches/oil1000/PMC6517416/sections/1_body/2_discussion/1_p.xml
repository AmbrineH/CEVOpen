 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">viren</italic>. Among the 18 PEOs, cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils showed the strongest fumigation and contact activities against the mycelial growth and conidial germination of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>. In the fumigation assay, 6 PEOs, including 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dahurica</italic> oil, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tatarinowii</italic> rhizome oil, cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cubeba</italic> oil and myrrh oil completely inhibited the mycelial growth and conidial germination of this pathogen, and the other 12 PEOs had moderate inhibitory effects. In the contact activity test, cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils showed stronger antifungal activity on the mycelial growth and conidial germination than the other 16 PEOs. It is interesting that 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cubeba</italic> oil had stronger fumigation activity while 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">wallichii oil</italic> showed stronger contact activity against mycelial growth and conidial germination of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>. Similar researches have been reported that volatile phase effects of oregano, rosemary and lavender essential oils were more effective on fungal growth of

 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>, with EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 4.28 μg/mL and 33.1 μg/mL, respectively, against mycelial growth and 4.47 μg/mL and 34.6 μg/mL, respectively, against conidial germination, which were lower than the values generally reported

 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cassia</italic> plant, which is commonly known as cinnamon, consumer acceptance is less of a problem because the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) lists cinnamon as a generally recognized as safe substance GRAS), and it is used in the fields of food, Chinese medicine, cosmetic and other materials around the world
