<p id="Par21" class="p">To evaluate the inhibitory effect on reproductivity of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>. The sporulation difference of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic> was conducted. As shown in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde reduced the fungal sporulation yields significantly compared with the normal sporulation yield (control). Among the three tested substances, cinnamon bark oil possessed strongest contact effect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3B</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde showed the strongest fumigation effect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>) on the sporulation of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>, which is not accordance with the antifungal effect of the tested substances against the conidial germination of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>. The reason for different antifungal effect on germination and sporulation haven’t been reported before and the different compounds in both PEOs and the interaction between chemicals and conidium might be the important factors and need further study.
