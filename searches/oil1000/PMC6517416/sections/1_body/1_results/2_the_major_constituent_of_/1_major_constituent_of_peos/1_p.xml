<p id="Par13" class="p">The major compounds of the cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils were analyzed using GC-MS and were listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, along with their retention indices, compound names and relative contents. As presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, the chemical components in cinnamon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>) and cinnamon bark (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>) oils were satisfactorily separated under the chromatographic and MS conditions. The natural components identified from the cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils represented 71.47% and 71.46% of the total oils, respectively. The most abundant compound in both the cinnamon bark and cinnamon oils was 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde. Its relative contents were 71.32% and 71.27%, respectively, in the two oils. These results were consistent with previous studies
