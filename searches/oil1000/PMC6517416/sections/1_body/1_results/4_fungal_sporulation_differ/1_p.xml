<p id="Par17" class="p">Sporulation of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic> was significantly affected by the tested substances (cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde) under both fumigation and contact conditions. The results of fungal sporulation difference was shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. Compared to the traditional contact method, fumigation method exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on the conidium sporulation. The fumigation treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde completely inhibited the conidium sporulation of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic>. Among the three tested substances, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde had the highest sporulation inhibition in the fumigation treatment method and cinnamon oil had the lowest inhibition under both treatment methods.
