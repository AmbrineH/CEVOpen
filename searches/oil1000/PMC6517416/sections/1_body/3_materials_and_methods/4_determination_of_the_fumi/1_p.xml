 </sup>. A suspension of 80 μL was spread onto the surface of the PDA medium or toxic medium as described in 2.3. The treated concentrations of the PEOs were 7.5 μL/L air for the fumigation activity experiment and 40 μg/mL for the contact activity test. Different concentrations of PEOs with higher antifungal activity (0.5 to 7.5 μL/L air in the fumigation activity test and 32 to 260 μg/mL in the contact activity assay) were applied for the determination of EC
