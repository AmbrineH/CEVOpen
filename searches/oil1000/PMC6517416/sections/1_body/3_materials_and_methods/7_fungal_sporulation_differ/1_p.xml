 </sup> with some modification. A spore suspension (10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> conidia/mL) of 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">virens</italic> was prepared from fermentative potato sucrose broth (PS) as described in 4.4. A suspension of 50 μL was spread onto the surface of the PDA medium or toxic medium as described in 2.3. The treated concentrations of the PEOs were 0.5 μL/L air for the fumigation activity experiment and 35 μg/mL for the contact activity test. Plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 28 °C and cultured for 10d for sporulation. Fungal spores of each Perti-dish were dislodged with appropriate amount of distilled water and suspended by vigorous mixing for 30 s. The number of spores was determined with a hemacytometer under a microscope (magnification 100×). Each combination of medium and conidial suspension was replicated three times.
