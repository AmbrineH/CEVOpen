<p id="Par25" class="p">The contact activity of the PEOs was determined using the toxic medium method. First, the stock solution was made by adding 0.04 g PEOs to 10 mL acetone. Second, a 100 μL stock solution of individual PEO was immediately added to the 20 mL sterile PDA medium at 45–50 °C and mixed thoroughly, which was designated toxic medium at the concentration of 20 μg/mL. When the EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values (the concentration of the tested substance causing a 50% inhibition against the mycelial growth compared with the control) of the PEOs with higher antifungal activity and individual components were determined, appropriate volumes of the stock solution of the PEOs and compounds were adjusted to a series of concentration gradients using acetone. The concentrations tested were 0.250 to 200 μg/mL. The control received the same quantity of acetone mixed with PDA. The 20 mL toxic medium was poured onto three aseptic 6-cm plastic Petri dishes.
