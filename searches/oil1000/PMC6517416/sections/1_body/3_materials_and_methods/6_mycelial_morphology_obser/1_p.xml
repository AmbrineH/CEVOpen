<p id="Par32" class="p">Using a clean blade, the square fungal block (5 mm × 5 mm × 2 mm) was cut from the fungal colony incubated in 2.3. The fungal block was dipped into 3.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer at room temperate for 48 h, and the mycelial block was washed with sterile water four times to rinse off the glutaraldehyde in 30 min. The mycelia were fixed with 1% OsO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> for 2 h. The samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%) for a period of 20 min in each series and finally treated with 100% ethanol. The samples were dried in a drying apparatus (Leica EM CPD030, Germany) up to the critical point with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The fixed material was mounted on stubs using double-sided carbon tape and coated with gold/palladium in a sputter coater system in a high-vacuum chamber (Hitachi MC1000, Japan) for 1 min at 6 mA. The samples were examined, and digital images were captured using an SU 8010 SEM at an accelerating voltage of 12 kV.
