<p id="Par31" class="p">The primary natural components of the strongest PEOs were determined using a gas chromatograph Agilent 7890 A interfaced with a QP2010 5975 C mass spectrometer (Shimadzu). An Rtx-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C for 3 min and programmed to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The MS were collected at 70 eV and a mass range of 30–550 amu (scan time 0.3 s). Qualitative identification of the compounds of the PEOs was based on retention indices relative to n-alkanes and computer matching with the NIST14. LIB (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in combination with published data. Quantitative analysis of the individual natural major component was based on the peak area normalization measurement, and the relative content of each component was calculated using the % peak area.</p>
