 <p> Scanning electron micrograph of V. virens hyphae. The pictures on the top are treated at 0.5 μL/L air in the fumigation activity assay. ( A) Hyphae without PEOs or trans-cinnamaldehyde (control). (B–D) Hyphae treated with cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde. On the bottom are treatments from the contact activity experiment at a concentration of 2 μg/mL. (a) Hyphae treated with acetone (CK). (b–d) Hyphae treated with cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde. All of the magnifications are ×10,000. </p>
