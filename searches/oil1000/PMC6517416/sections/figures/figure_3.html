 <p> Histogram of three tested substances on fungal sporulation yield of V. virens by two methods. ( A) Is the sporulation yield of V. virens treated with acetone (Control) and cinnamon oil, cinnamon bark oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde at the concentration of 35 µg/mL by contact method, ( B) is the sporulation yields of V. virens treated without PEOs (Control) and with cinnamon oil, cinnamon bark oil and trans-cinnamaldehyde at the concentration of 0.5 µL/L air by fumigation method. Data are represented means ± SE of 3 replications. </p>
