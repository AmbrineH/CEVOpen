 <p id="Par1" class="p">Rice false smut (RFS), caused by 
  <italic class="italic">Villosiclava virens</italic>, is an emerging devastating disease of rice panicles worldwide and produces yield loss and mycotoxin residues in rice. In this study, 18 plant essential oils (PEOs) were selected to evaluate antifungal activity via fumigation and contact methods against the mycelial growth and conidial germination of 
  <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">virens</italic>. The primary compositions of PEOs with stronger fungistatic activity were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS), and the changes in the mycelial morphology were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antifungal tests showed that cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil had stronger fumigation and contact effects on 
  <italic class="italic">V</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">virens</italic> than the other oils tested. The primary active composition in both cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil was 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde, which exhibited contact activities with EC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 2.13 and 35.9 μg/mL against mycelial growth and conidial germination, respectively. The hyphae surface morphological alterations caused by cinnamon bark oil, cinnamon oil and 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde included shriveling, vacuolation and exfoliation. In conclusion, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon oil have the potential to prevent and control RFS, and 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde is a promising natural lead compound for new fungicide discoveries to control RFS contamination and mycotoxin residues in rice.
