These considerations led to the design of the prospective, randomized, double-blind Reduction in Cardiovascular Events with EPA-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) assessing the ability of icosapent ethyl to reduce CV outcomes in high-risk statin-treated patients with triglyceride levels of at least 500 mg/dL [

 <xref rid="B35-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The overall rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation of trial were similar in both the clinical groups. However, serious adverse events, i.e., bleeding and the rate of hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or flutter, were observed with higher frequency among patients in the icosapent ethyl group. The authors suggested that the observed reduction in the risk of ischemic events caused by icosapent ethyl administration may be explained by metabolic effects other than a reduction of triglyceride levels, i.e., antithrombotic, membrane-stabilizing, plaque stabilizing and anti-inflammatory mechanisms [

In addition, n3-PUFAs also act as substrates for the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), i.e., resolvins (short for resolution phase interaction products), protectins, and maresins (short for macrophage mediators in resolving inflammation) [
