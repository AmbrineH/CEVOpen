<p class="p">Finally, it is should be noted that n-3 PUFAs have dramatically modified the biochemical composition of the lipid rafts, i.e., the dynamic sphingolipid-cholesterol enriched regions of the membrane that concentrate specific signaling proteins [
 <xref rid="B49-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. These lipid microdomanins play a crucial role in the CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation, and downstream in the B cell activity [
 <xref rid="B50-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Several in vitro and in vivo data have shown that n-3 PUFAs displaced many of the signaling proteins necessary for CD4+ T cell activation [
 <xref rid="B51-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In addition, n-3 PUFAs suppressed CD4+T cell polarization into Th1 and Th17 cells, probably by altering the IL-6/gp130/STAT3 pathway [
 <xref rid="B52-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. On the other hand, n-3 PUFAs or SPMs boosted humoral immunity by influencing B cell development in the bone marrow, B cell activation and antibody production in response to antigen [
