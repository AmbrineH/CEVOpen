<p class="p">In recent years, much focus has been placed on the beneficial effects of fish consumption strengthened by the concept that the ocean offers a wonderful resource for novel compounds. Many of the positive effects of fish, including those on dyslipidemia and heart disease, have been attributed to n-3 PUFAs, i.e., EPA and DHA. However, in addition to n-3 PUFAs, other nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins and proteins, [
