<p class="p">In line with these data, a recent study provided a link among EPA supplementation, the generation of SPM’s precursors, and their signaling pathways in the context of cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Specifically, the authors identified 18-HEPE as a plasma biosynthetic pathway marker of EPA supplementation, and characterized the receptor for the 18-HEPE–derived lipid mediator RvE1, i.e., ERV1/ChemR23, as a key player in atherosclerosis. The targeted deletion of Erv1/Chemr23 in 2 independent hyperlipidemic murine models was instead associated with proatherogenic signaling in macrophages, increased oxLDL uptake, reduced phagocytosis, and increased atherosclerotic plaque size and necrotic core formation. Moreover, a specific ERV1/ChemR23–expressing macrophage subtype was detected near the necrotic core into the human atherosclerotic lesions and its gene expression was increased in the plaques harvested from patients receiving statins [
