<p class="p">Many observational studies have shown the potential role of nutraceuticals and functional foods, such as n3-PUFAs, probiotics and prebiotics, in preventing chronic inflammatory disease or to aid in their treatment. Since IBD, AMD and glaucoma are illnesses increasing at alarming rates, more basic and clinical studies are needed to definitely determine if dietary factors (alone or in combination) are able to prevent the development of these disabling pathologies. The discovery of n-3 PUFAs-derived anti-inflammatory molecules, i.e., SPMs, may offer a fascinating new complementary option for the treatment of these inflammatory-based diseases. Indeed, a new area of research is focusing on the development of synthetic analogs of the natural SPMs as well as on the combination between n-3 PUFAs with drugs acting as regulators of endogenous enzyme activities [
