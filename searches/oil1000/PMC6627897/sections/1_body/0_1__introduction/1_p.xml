<p class="p">Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important constituents of the phospholipids of all cell membranes, where they play roles assuring the correct environment for membrane protein function, maintaining membrane fluidity, regulating cell signaling, gene expression and cellular function, and serving as substrates for the synthesis of lipid mediators. The fatty acid composition of inflammatory cells can be modified by increasing intake of marine n-3 PUFAs, which leads to a higher content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [
 <xref rid="B1-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. These changes in membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition might be expected to influence the function of cells involved in inflammation through: (1) Alterations of the membrane fluidity and raft structure; (2) effects on cell signalling pathways; and (3) alterations in the pattern of the lipid mediators produced [
