<p class="p">The human gut microbiota has become a widely discussed topic over the past decade. The intestinal microbial community lives in a mutualistic relationship with its host and is a key contributor to host metabolism. There is mounting evidence from the literature that brought to the forefront the impact of mutualistic bacterial communities of the gut microbiota on human health. Each personâ€™s microbiome is unique, rapidly developing throughout early childhood and with differing rates of variability in adulthood. Microbial colonization runs in parallel with immune system maturation and plays a role in intestinal physiology and regulation [

Moreover, the network of mucosal immune cells and intestinal epithelium acts in concert to enforce barrier function, prevent mucosal infections and maintain a symbiotic relationship with the commensal flora. The disruption of this balance, whether due to genetic or environmental insults, is now recognized for having important and far-reaching impacts on immune tolerance and hypersensitivity in intestinal and extra-intestinal tissues, including the liver, the lung, the eyes, and the central nervous system [
