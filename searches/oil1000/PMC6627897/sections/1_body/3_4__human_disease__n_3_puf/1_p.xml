<p class="p">Inflammation seems to be the common denominator among the above described seemingly unrelated biological entities, i.e., the gut microbiome, the immune system, and n-3 PUFAs. Inflammation is currently accepted to play a key role in the progression of several chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative syndromes, etc. [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In addition, as above described several evidences support the role of both the microbiota and the n-3 PUFAs in regulating inflammation and the immune system [

 <xref rid="B74-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Moreover, dietary n-3 PUFAs, affecting gut integrity, have been shown to reduce clinical colitis and colonic immunopathology by improving epithelial barrier function in animal models [
 <xref rid="B84-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. Indeed, in clinical studies n-3 PUFAs have demonstrated the ability of: (i) Decreasing the

 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio; (ii) decreasing the levels of 
 <italic class="italic">Coprococcus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Facecalibacterium</italic>; (iii) increasing the abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial genera, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospira</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B87-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. These data were in line with those obtained in a subsequent study where the authors also found a significant correlation between n-3 PUFAs plasma levels and SCFA-producing bacteria, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B85-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. In addition, a diet supplemented with n-3 PUFAs was able to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders and dysbiosis induced by social instability stress during adolescence, and these effects were maintained through adulthood [

 <xref rid="B89-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] supporting the concept that a healthy diet may have long-lasting beneficial effects and help fight off neurodegenerative diseases. Altogether these data allow hypothesizing a link among n-3 PUFAs intake, gut microbiome shaping and immune system modulation with the final common aim of hampering inflammatory-based disease (
