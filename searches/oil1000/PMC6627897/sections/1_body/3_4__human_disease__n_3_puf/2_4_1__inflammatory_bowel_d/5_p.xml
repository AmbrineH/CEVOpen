<p class="p">Several mechanisms are responsible for the intestinal inflammation caused by the consumption of high-fat diets (HFDs), including both changes in the intestinal barrier and composition of the intestinal microbiota. Experimental and clinical data indicated a direct correlation between plasma endotoxin levels and dietary fat intake, which suggested an increase of the IP [

 <xref rid="B111-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>] due to the decrease of epithelial tight junction proteins, such as occludin. Indeed, several experimental studies showed a dramatic decrease of intestinal occludin expression associated to the administration of a HFD [

 <xref rid="B114-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. On the other hand, high consumption of carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose, lactose, or fructose, overwhelms absorptive mechanisms of the intestine, resulting in high luminal sugar concentrations used by the microbiota as an energy source [
 <xref rid="B115-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis, consumption of a high sugar diet was demonstrated to promote intestinal dysbiosis, the expansion of harmful bacteria (such as,
