<p class="p">Meta-analyses revealed a low incidence of IBD in eskimos, whose diet is particularly rich in n-3 PUFAs [
 <xref rid="B134-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>]. Starting from these clinical evidences, the impact of dietary n-3 PUFAs has been evaluated in different models of colitis. All the results obtained in these experiments are coherent and indicate that n-3 PUFAs decrease chemically-induced intestinal tissue damage and inflammation [
 <xref rid="B135-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>]. Similarly, in fat-1 transgenic mice, characterized by high levels of endogenous n-3 PUFAs, the intestinal tissue damage was significantly reduced compared to wild type mice, together with decreased expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and increased synthesis of SPMs [
