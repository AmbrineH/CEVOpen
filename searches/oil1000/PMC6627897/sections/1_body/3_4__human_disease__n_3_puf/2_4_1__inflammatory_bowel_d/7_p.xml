<p class="p">The role of gut microbiota in colitis development was confirmed by using animal models. GF mice displayed minimal inflammation or delayed onset of chemically and genetically induced colitis compared to the conventionally raised (CONV-R) animals [

 <xref rid="B125-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. However, higher mortality was seen in GF than CONV-R mice after giving dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), due to massive gut epithelial injury [
 <xref rid="B126-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. The seemingly paradoxical phenomenon could be explained by the lack of immune maturation and/or tolerance as well as the impairment of epithelial turnover (which is dependent on commensal colonization) in GF mouse intestine [

 <xref rid="B128-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Gut microbiota metabolites act as important signals for the monitoring of the correct function of the epithelial barrier and the immune cells. Similarly, immune-driven signals central to gut homeostasis can also modulate the metabolism of immune cells [
 <xref rid="B129-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. It is well known that several hematopoietic cells produce IL-10 and its importance for maintaining tolerance within the intestinal microbiota come from experimental observations using IL-10- or IL-10R-deficient mice (both these mouse models develop spontaneous colitis) (see below, [
 <xref rid="B130-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]), and clinical data (IBD patients are characterized by decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10). In line with these results, administration of genetically modified probiotic, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">Lactococcus lactis</italic> expressing IL-10, had demonstrated a significant remission of disease activity in CD patients. Furthermore, oligofructose-enriched inulin (OF-IN) administration was able to induce an improvement in CD associated to a reduction of the 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcus gnavus</italic>. In addition, it has been recorded that the intake of this prebiotic is able to increase the abundance of the 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium longum</italic>. This bacteria neutralizes reactive oxygen species and exerts anti-inflammatory effects at the site of inflammation, reducing gastrointestinal discomfort and tissue injury [
 <xref rid="B131-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. Previous studies also showed that different probiotic combinations, especially 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium longum</italic> or a multistrain mix of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium longum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus faecalis</italic>, increased expression of tight junction proteins in IBD [

 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup>, a mixture of 4 species of Lactobacillus, 3 species of Bifidobacterium, and 1 species of Streptococcus, has been shown to: (i) Improve epithelial barrier damage; (ii) induce remission in active UC; and (iii) decrease pro-inflammatory mucosal cytokine expression [
