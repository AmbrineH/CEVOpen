 <xref rid="B159-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>]. In vitro and in vivo models of IBD have been used to test the antioxidant properties of amino acids. Cysteine, methionine, taurine, tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine are able to reduce the oxidative stress, because of the presence of a thiol group and of an aromatic ring [

 <xref rid="B160-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>]. In addition, dietary cysteine was effective at reducing the intestinal inflammatory responses and at enhancing mucin synthesis in DSS-induced colitis animal models [

The anti-inflammatory activity of these bioactive molecules involves the activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a protein controlling different cellular activities (i.e., proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis) [
