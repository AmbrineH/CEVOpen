<p class="p">The hyper-responsiveness of T cells toward non-pathogenic antigens could represent one of the possible etiologies for IBD. The presence of antibodies against commensal microbial antigens and autoantigens, such as anti-

Since it has been shown that colitis-prone genetically predisposed GF mice colonized by IBD-associated-microbiota developed severe colitis compared to those that were colonized by healthy human microbiota, it can be hypothesized that gut dysbiosis contributes to IBD pathogenesis [

Together, these findings strongly indicate a bidirectional relationship between such diseases and gut dysbiosis, in which dysbiosis potentially contributes to the onset of IBD and also serves as a secondary consequence of gut inflammation [
