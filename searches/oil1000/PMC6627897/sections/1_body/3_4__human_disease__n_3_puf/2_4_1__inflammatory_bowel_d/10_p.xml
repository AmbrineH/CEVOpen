<p class="p">Two large clinical trials designed at evaluating the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on CD provided conflicting results and concluded that supplementation was not effective in preventing CD relapse [

 <xref rid="B146-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>]. Intriguingly, another study suggested that IBD patients that achieved a n-3/n-6 ratio of 1 maintained disease remission at a significantly higher rate compared to those did not reach this goal [
 <xref rid="B147-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. A double-blind, randomized study was carried out in 38 pediatric CD patients, who received, for 12 months, 5-aminosalicylic acid (50 mg/kg/d) + n-3 PUFAs (3 capsule/d, each capsule contained 400 mg/g EPA and 200 mg/g DHA) or 5-5-aminosalicylic acid (50 mg/kg/d) + olive oil placebo capsules [
 <xref rid="B148-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. The results indicated that the addition of enteric-coated capsules to a conventional therapy with 5-aminosalicylic acid delayed the relapse of the disease even though it could not prevent it. Another study used enteric-coated n-3 PUFAs capsules for remission maintenance in adult CD patients at high risk of relapse, and found n-3 PUFAs to be more effective than placebo [
 <xref rid="B149-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>]. However, two multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, called Epanova Program in Crohnâ€™s 1 and 2, (EPIC1 and EPIC2), found that relapse occurred in 32% with n-3 PUFAs and 36% with placebo in EPIC1, and 48% with n-3 PUFAs and 49% with placebo in EPIC2, indicating that n-3 PUFAs did not reduce the rate of relapse in patients with quiescent CD [
 <xref rid="B146-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>]. Of interest, two random double-blind placebo crossover studies reported significant improvement of the disease [
 <xref rid="B150-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>] and of the oxidative stress status in active UC patients receiving sulfasalazine, respectively [
 <xref rid="B151-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. Thus, the efficacy of n-3 PUFA or fish oil against CD or UC is, at best, marginal. However, none of the studies reported any adverse effects associated with n-3 PUFA supplementation. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies showed that fish consumption was inversely associated with the risk of CD. Moreover, there was a strong inverse association between dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and the risk of UC [
 <xref rid="B152-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. Previously published studies revealed that fish consumption and dietary n-3 PUFAs intake might play a role in the etiology of IBD [

 <xref rid="B154-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. In line with these findings, one study revealed that the Mediterranean diet, rich in fish and seafood, reduced inflammation [
 <xref rid="B151-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>] and normalized the gut microbiome in CD patients, i.e., an increase in Bacteroidetes and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> clusters, and a reduction of Protebacteria and Bacillaceae [
 <xref rid="B155-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>]. In a pilot study, short-term EPA-supplementation reduced mucosal inflammation favoring an improvement of both endoscopic and histological inflammation in almost all patients, together with a significant up-regulation of IL-10 expression, and a reduction of STAT3 activation [
 <xref rid="B156-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>]. Moreover, microbiota analysis showed that EPA treatment increased the family Porphyromonadaceae and the genus
