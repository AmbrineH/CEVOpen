<p class="p">It is well known that the microbiota and the gut have a symbiotic relationship: The human host supplies the nutrients needed for the survival of the microbes, and these latter protect the host against pathogens, and act as regulatory factors of the immune responses [

An aberrant mucosal immune system and irregular mucosal epithelium with increased intestinal permeability (IP) may permit the translocation of bacterial-derived toxins causing gut inflammation. The communication between the gut microbiota system and all the organs of the human body is regulated by the IP [

Indeed, IP degree is very changeable and results from the interconnection between several factors: Type of diet; gene expression; intestinal/liver pathology; surface mucus; integrity of tight junctions; and production of immunoglobulins [
