<p class="p">Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 242 loci associated to the presence of IBD [

 <xref rid="B90-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. For example, variants at the NOD2 and CDH1 loci confer the largest increase in relative risk of IBD and have been associated to UC, respectively [

 <xref rid="B92-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. The NOD2 gene encodes a protein that is activated within the cytoplasm of macrophages and dendritic cells by bacterial ligands [
 <xref rid="B94-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], whereas CDH1 gene has a critical role in cell-cell adhesion and is also required for epithelial cell tight junction formation [
 <xref rid="B95-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. Moreover, a meta-analysis revealed that genetic variations in TLR4 gene, the receptor for LPS, conferred a statistically significant risk of developing CD and UC [
 <xref rid="B96-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. In addition, polymorphisms in TLR2, the main receptor for gram-positive bacteria, have been associated with IBD in humans and there is an inflammation-dependent induction of TLR2 expression in intestinal macrophages [
