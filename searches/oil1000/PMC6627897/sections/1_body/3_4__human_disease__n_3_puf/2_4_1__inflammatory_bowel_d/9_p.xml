<p class="p">Moreover, a diet high in fibers and n-3 PUFAs is protective for the development of IBD, whereas a diet high in refined sugars, complex carbohydrates, and n-6 PUFAs (i.e., red meat), increases the risk of acquiring IBD. A number of studies indicated that homeostasis is crucial to have a good n-3 to n-6 PUFAs ratio, the former being anti-inflammatory and the latter pro-inflammatory molecules [

The cornerstone is that dietary fiber is a plant-based carbohydrate that resists digestion by intestinal and pancreatic enzymes in the human GI tract. Soluble and insoluble dietary fibers are essential for gastrointestinal mucosa health because they serve as important substrates for the gut microbiota. The fermentation products selectively promote the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli and exert anti-inflammatory (such as, inhibition of NFÎºB transcription) and anti-carcinogenic functions [
