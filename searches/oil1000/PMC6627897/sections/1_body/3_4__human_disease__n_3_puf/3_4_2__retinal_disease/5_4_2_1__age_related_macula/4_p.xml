<p class="p">On the other hand, the neuroprotective role of n-3 PUFAs has been proved by several epidemiological studies that observed a decreased risk of ADM in subjects with high intake of n-3 PUFAs [
 <xref rid="B173-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>,
 <xref rid="B197-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>]. In a large prospective study, with 24â€“28 years of follow-up, n-3 PUFAs and fatty fish intakes were associated to a lower risk of visually intermediate AMD, but no relationship was found with the risk of advanced AMD [
 <xref rid="B198-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">198</xref>]. Moreover, in healthy volunteers, macular pigment density was associated not only with L and Z plasma concentrations, but also with plasma levels of phospholipids containing n-3 PUFAs, particularly EPA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) [
 <xref rid="B199-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>]. The latter being the second most abundant n-3 PUFAs found within the retina and a metabolic intermediary between EPA and DHA [
 <xref rid="B200-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>]. In a mouse model of AMD, the administration of L, Z and n-3 PUFAs caused retinal lesion regression associated with a reduced expression of pathologic genes, and preservation of photoreceptors [
 <xref rid="B201-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>]. Moreover, in another experimental model of AMD, the supplementation with n-3 PUFAs reduced the photoreceptor damage, and the mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="B202-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>,
 <xref rid="B203-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>,
 <xref rid="B204-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>]. Altogether these data indicated that the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs could be explained by a combination between the resolution of inflammation and the induction of a regenerative process. Coherent with this hypothesis is the discovery of elovanoids, bioactive lipid mediators derived from very long chain (VLC) n-3 PUFAs by the action of the elongase ELOVL4. Indeed, the contemporary presence of free VLC n-3 PUFAs and oxidative stress seems to generate a pro-homeostatic and cytoprotective milieu [
 <xref rid="B205-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. In line with these results, it has been observed that mutant EVOVL4 caused juvenile macular degeneration due to protein mislocalization and photoreceptor cell death [
 <xref rid="B205-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. Recently, a linear association between the dose of fish consumption and the risk of AMD was found, strengthening the role of n-3 PUFAs in AMD pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B206-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggested that the metabolic pathway responsible for the synthesis of the elovanoids should be the object of future studies because it could open a new therapeutic approach for AMD.
