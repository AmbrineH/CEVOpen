<p class="p">As discussed earlier, gut microbiota affect all aspects of immune development and homeostasis in health and disease [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. For this reason, the intestinal microbiota represent candidates for the interplay between the genetic and environmental factors that cause AMD. Using mouse models of neovascular AMD, it has been demonstrated that HFDs exacerbated choroidal neovascularization by altering gut microbiota [

Gut dysbiosis instead leads to heightened IP and chronic low-grade inflammation, characteristic of inflammaging, with elevated production of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and VEGF-A. Both antibiotic treatment and microbiotal transplants (T) from chow diet (CD)-fed mice restored microbial proportions, i.e., Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio of 3 to 1. In addition, improved glucose tolerance, lower systemic and choroidal inflammation, and IP in HFDxCDT mice compared to HFDxHFDT mice were observed [

 <xref rid="B208-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">208</xref>]. In addition, HGD-fed mice showed lower microbial diversity than CD-fed animals, with a reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and an increased level of Proteobacteria at the phylus levels (one of the best source of LPS), as well as higher levels of the Desulfovibrio vulgaris species. A significant increase of IP, demonstrated by a reduced expression of tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and occludin, was also observed [
