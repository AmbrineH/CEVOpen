<p class="p">As above mentioned, intestinal bacteria are often considered a hidden metabolic organ, since they play a significant role in human nutrition and metabolism. It has been demonstrated that CONV-R mice had reduced levels of multiple PC species in lens and retina compared to GF animals, which suggested that the gut microbiota influenced the lens and retinal lipid composition [

Antibiotics depletion of gut microbiota in a spontaneous mouse model of uveitis resulted in significant attenuation of the retinal disease, associated with a reduced population of Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria (LP). Co-housing GF with CON-R mice restored disease development [

Recently, an experimental study demonstrated subclinical intestinal dysfunction in retinal disease leading to enhanced migration of leukocytes between the intestine and the eye. These alterations were improved by 3-week pre-treatment of SCFA sthrough induction of Treg in several tissues and inhibition of T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 [
