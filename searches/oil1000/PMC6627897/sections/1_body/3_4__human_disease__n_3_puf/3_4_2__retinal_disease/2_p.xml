<p class="p">Pathological factors affecting the retina health include ischemia, light exposure, oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, neuroactive cell signaling molecules, and aging. Moreover, plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, have been elevated in subjects with essential hypertension, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, retinal disease, and inflammatory bowel disease [
