<p class="p">Recently, in a mouse model, it was shown that a transient elevation of IOP was sufficient to induce T-cell infiltration into the retina and this step was essential for the development of glaucoma. In addition, the authors demonstrated that T-cell activations and glaucomatous neurodegeneration were abolished in GF mice, strengthening the hypothesis that a bacteria-sensitized T-cell responses underly the pathogenesis of glaucoma [

In line with these data, long-term intake of Lactobacillus paracasei KW3110 has been associated with a more abundance of beneficial gut bacteria and a reduction of the age-related immune dysfunctions, i.e., lowered expansion of pro-inflammatory T cells and serum cytokines [

Instead, this probiotic treatment determined a reduction of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, demonstrated by increased Bifidobacteriaceae and decreased Streptococcaceae families. It is important to highlight that Bifidobacterium is known as one of the most beneficial bacterial family [
