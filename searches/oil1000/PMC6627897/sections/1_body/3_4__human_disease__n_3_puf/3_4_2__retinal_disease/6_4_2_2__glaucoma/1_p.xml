<p class="p">Glaucoma is a term defining a group of optic degenerative diseases characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and excavation of the optic nerve head (ONH) [
 <xref rid="B212-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. Glaucoma is the leading cause of global irreversible blindness. The number of people with glaucoma worldwide (aged 40 e 80 years) will increase from 64.3 million in 2013 to 111.8 million in 2040, disproportionately affecting people residing in Asia and Africa [
 <xref rid="B213-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">213</xref>]. Primary open-angle glaucoma is characterized by a particular abnormal appearance of the optic- nerve disk, whereas pigmentary glaucoma is a secondary glaucoma showing: (1) Disruption of the posterior iris-pigment epithelium; (2) dispersion of the pigment throughout the anterior segment and the trabecular mesh work; and (3) increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) [
 <xref rid="B214-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>]. Age, elevated IOP, race, family history, myopia, diabetes, and para-inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis, development and progression of glaucoma (

 <xref rid="B225-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">225</xref>]. In addition, in an experimental model of hereditary glaucoma [
 <xref rid="B226-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">226</xref>], the administration of n-3 PUFAs, alone or in combination with timolol, displayed neuroprotective effects only when the ratio of AA to Epa was kept between 1 and 1.5 [
 <xref rid="B227-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">227</xref>]. This result was associated with the downregulation of IL-18 and TNF-α expression only when n-3 PUFAs were administrated alone, which indicated that the neuroprotection in the retina might be mediated by other mechanisms, i.e., the synthesis of SPMs were able, not only to resolve inflammation, but also protected organs and stimulate tissue regeneration (

 <xref rid="B230-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">230</xref>], since both a and b-wave amplitudes of the electroretinogram (ERG) were decreased after a marked elevation of IOP caused by an ischemia-reperfusion sequence [

 <xref rid="B233-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">233</xref>]. In line with these data, Bazan and co-workers demonstrated that the oxygenated metabolite of DHA, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), was responsible of these neuroprotective effects (

NPD1 was shown to decrease: (i) The production of inflammatory molecules (such as COX-2, IL-1β); (ii) to up-regulate anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins; and (iii) to down-regulate pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad, Caspase-3) [
