<p class="p">Within the neural retina, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PEA) represent the predominant PUFA-rich lipid class, followed by phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Arachidonic acid (AA) is the major PUFA in the neural and vascular tissue of the retina [

 <xref rid="B174-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>]. PUFA-containing phospholipids enter the RPE or photoreceptor inner segment via a receptor mediated transport process. Tracer studies have indicated that DHA-containing phospholipids are then integrated as structural constituents of photoreceptor disk membranes and are retained in proximity to rhodopsin molecules across the life span of these organelles [

Several bioactive molecules play a crucial role in the retinal disease, i.e., eicosanoids, angiogenic factors, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), reactive oxygen species, cyclic nucleotides, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines, and inflammatory phospholipids. It has been shown that n-3 PUFAs are able to modulate the production, activation, and potency of these molecules. DHA and its substrate, EPA, influence eicosanoid metabolism by reducing n-6 PUFAs levels (mainly arachidonic acid, AA, 20:4n-6) and compete for enzymes (cyclooxygenase, COX and lipoxygenase, LOX) producing AA-based angiogenic and proinflammatory eicosanoids [
