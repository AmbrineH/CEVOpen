<p class="p">A noticeable example of the symbiotic effects of the microbiome is the immune system, whose normal development and behavior are strongly influenced by microbial metabolites that are produced by: (i) Bacteria from dietary components; (ii) the host and biochemically modified by gut bacteria; and (iii) by gut microbes. In this context, a complex interplay between the local microbiota, the intestinal epithelium and the resident immune cells has begun to emerge, in which all participants actively foster GI homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Segmented filamentous bacteria are best known for their ability to induce the differentiation of naïve T cells to form antigen-specific Th17 cells in the ileum of mice [
 <xref rid="B68-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] and humans [
 <xref rid="B69-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Th17 cells play a critical role in host defense against extracellular pathogens (i.e., fungi and extracellular bacteria [
 <xref rid="B70-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]) and tissue homeostasis (i.e., promoting epithelial barrier functions [
 <xref rid="B71-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]) but can induce autoimmunity [
 <xref rid="B72-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The mechanisms implicated in the balance between ‘pathogenic’ and ‘non-pathogenic’ Th17 cell states are still unknown. However, treatment of non-pathogenic Th17 cells with IL-23 converts them into a pathogenic phenotype, suggesting that IL-23 is a cytokine that drives the functional phenotype of Th17 cells [
 <xref rid="B73-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Furthermore, the metabolic relationship between diets and immune cells in the gut has been strengthened by the finding that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) promoted B cell metabolism [
 <xref rid="B74-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] and the development and function of colonic regulatory T (Treg) cells [
 <xref rid="B75-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Treg cells have played a role of gatekeeper of commensal tolerance by the immune system, through suppression of aberrant T cell responses. A balance between Th17 and Treg cell differentiation has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B76-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Beyond SCFAs, gut microbiota have produced several additional immunologically important metabolites from food components. Dietary tryptophan, for instance, is processed to different indole derivatives, which can act as ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) [
 <xref rid="B77-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], a ligand-activated transcription factor which plays a crucial role in the development of multiple tissues. In the intestinal mucosa, AhR is required for postnatal maintenance of Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) producing IL-22, as well as for the formation of isolated lymphoid follicles [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. IL-22 is a cytokine that supports the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by inducing the secretion of antimicrobial peptides from epithelial cells, the production of mucins and the proliferation of intestinal goblet cells [
 <xref rid="B78-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Highly reactive polyamines, i.e., putrescine, spermidine and spermine, derive from arginine by the action of gut microbiota, are involved in the development and maintenance of the intestinal mucosa and resident immune cells [
 <xref rid="B79-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. In addition, arginine itself is an important modulator of the immunometabolism of macrophages and T cells, and thus affects their effector functions [
 <xref rid="B80-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Moreover, free taurine generated by deconjugation of primary bile acids [
 <xref rid="B81-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] can promote the activation of the NLRP6 inflammasome and the production IL-18, supporting epithelial barrier function and maintenance [
 <xref rid="B82-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. In addition, bile acids are able to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines from monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and Kupffer cells [
