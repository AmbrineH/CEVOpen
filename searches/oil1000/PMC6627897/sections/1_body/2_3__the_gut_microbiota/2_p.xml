<p class="p">The mammalian intestine is colonized by a complex community of microorganisms, called microbiota, constituted by bacteria (approximately 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>), archaea, viruses (especially bacteriophages), protozoans and fungi [
 <xref rid="B58-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing through random sequencing of all genes established that the human gut possesses a bacterial microbiome that is predominated by phyla, such as

 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Verrucomicrobia</italic>. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes represent 90% of the gut microbiota [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. It is important to remember that the colonization of the human gut starts prenatally and continues after birth, reaching the adult microbiota state between the ages of 2 and 5 years [
 <xref rid="B59-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Following birth, diverse microbes colonize the human intestine, and several factors are known to affect this process, i.e., gestational age, mode of delivery, diet (breast milk vs formula), sanitation and antibiotic treatment [
 <xref rid="B60-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Several studies showed a positive correlation between human milk oligosaccharides and the number of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> demonstrating that milk oligosaccharides have a probiotic effect by stimulating the development of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic>-rich microbiota [
 <xref rid="B61-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Furthermore, in addition to proteins, fats, carbohydrates and endocannabinoids, human breast milk contains immunoglobulins (IgA and IgG), antimicrobial compounds (lysozyme and lactoferrin), immune-regulatory cytokines (e.g. TGF-β and IL-10), and lymphocytes that express gut homing markers [

 <xref rid="B63-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Altogether these data indicate that intestinal bacterial colonization dramatically influence the development of the host immune system in early life and affects health and disease in later life, as indicated by the loss of immune function in germ-free (GF) mice [
