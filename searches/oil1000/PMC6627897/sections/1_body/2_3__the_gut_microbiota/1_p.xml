<p class="p">The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a passage formed by mucosa, submucosa, and smooth muscle containing a huge network of nerves and blood vessels. The mucosa is responsible for: Digestion and absorption of nutrients from the diet; protection of the body against physical and chemical damage from luminal contents; and supply of immunity [

The small intestinal epithelium, the single cell layer that forms the luminal surface, is folded to form villi and crypts. Both these structures serve to increase the total absorption surface of the intestine. Moreover, in the mucosa different types of cells are present, such as enterocytes (the main cellular component accounting for about 80%), Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine (comprise just 1% of the epithelium) [

Enteroendocrine cells, distributed throughout the GI tract, form a large endocrine organ that control: (1) GI secretion and motility; (2) regulation of food intake; (3) postprandial glucose levels; and (4) direct communication with neurons innervating the GI tract (these cells are part of the gut brain axis) [
