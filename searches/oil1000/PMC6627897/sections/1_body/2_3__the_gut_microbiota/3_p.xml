<p class="p">A significant change in the gut microbiota composition accompanies the weaning from the mother and the introduction of solid foods, with enhanced colonization of butyrate producers, including

 <xref rid="B66-marinedrugs-17-00374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Once established, the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable throughout adult life in the absence of perturbations such as long-term dietary changes, disease-associated dysbiosis, or the use of antibiotics. However, centenarianâ€™s microbiota showed decreased levels of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> and Enterobacteriaceae, while 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> species levels were increased compared with younger adults. For these reasons, dietary-intervention studies are warranted to investigate whether changing the dietary pattern of elderly individuals can alter their gut microbiota in a way that is beneficial to their general health [
