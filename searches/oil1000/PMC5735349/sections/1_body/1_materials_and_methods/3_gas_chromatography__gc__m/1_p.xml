<p class="p">Analysis of the main components of the most active essential oil extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>.
 <italic class="italic"> erythrocarpa</italic> leaves was carried out using a GC (Agilent 6890, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) connected to an MS (Agilent 5975). The GC was equipped with a DB1-HT column (30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.1 µm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 40 to 100°C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and then from 100 to 230 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, after which it was held at 230 °C for 5 min. The detector and injector temperatures were 280 °C and 240 °C, respectively. The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was 1.5 ml/min and the split ratio was 1:10. For the sample injection (split less), 10 μl of LEO was diluted in 500 μl of CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 1 μl of this solution was injected for analysis. Identification of the compounds was done by comparison of their mass spectra with reference spectra in the Wiley libraries. The GC-MS retention indices were also calculated using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C6-C31).
