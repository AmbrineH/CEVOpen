   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Lipid bilayers can form a number of different structures upon their composition in PL species. Some examples of lipid shapes and their influence on membrane structure are shown. Lipids with a small polar head (blue), such as PtdEtn, have a molecular shape that resembles a truncated cone. They induce a negative curvature strain. Lipids with a bulky polar head and only one acyl chain (e.g., lysophospholipids, green) have a molecular shape similar to an inverted cone and induce a positive curvature strain in membranes. Lipids such as PtdCho have similar cross-sectional areas for the polar head and hydrophobic region and resemble cylinders (red). They form lamellar phases, with no curvature strain. Not to scale.
