<p class="p">The amphiphilic nature of PL leads their spontaneous distribution into bilayers in aqueous environments, which are the basic component of all cellular membranes. The nature of their head-group and the length and saturation of their acyl chains define the category of PL species and the structural features of the membrane, i.e., viscosity, curvature, and electrostatic charge of the bilayer (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]). The physiological particularities of subcellular organelles are based on their membrane properties, including lipid composition which indeed needs to be homeostatically preserved to maintain the organelleâ€™s physiological purpose. Membrane protein abundance and composition also affect the physicochemical properties of biological membranes. The most robust demonstration of this influence comes from experiments where lipids isolated from biological membranes self-assemble into non-lamellar phases, not into bilayers as they do in their natural, protein-rich environment [
