<p class="p">The electrostatic charge of the bilayer is another element responsible for the maintenance of an organelleâ€™s physiological identity and function. Asymmetric distribution of PLs between both leaflets is strongly dependent upon the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, the precise asymmetric distribution of PLs between both leaflets of the PM is established, and therefore the corresponding effect on membrane electrostatics. On one hand, PtdSer fluctuates from a higher concentration in the luminal leaflet of the ER to an opposite distribution at the PM, where PtdSer faces the cytoplasm and contributes to the negative surface charge [
