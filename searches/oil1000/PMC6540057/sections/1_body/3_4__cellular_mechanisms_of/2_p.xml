<p class="p">Further focusing on PL, PtdCho amount is beyond 50% of all PL in most eukaryotes. PtdCho commonly involves one cis-unsaturated acyl chain, for instance oleic acid (C18:1). This cis-double bond makes a strong kink that undoubtedly decreases the packing compactness of the acyl chains and in turn rises membrane fluidity [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02167-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, at a physiological temperature, PtdCho arranges into closed bilayers in a liquid crystalline state. All in all, PtdCho is specially endowed to keep a stable and fluid ground for cellular membranes (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). By contrast, the conical shape of PtdEtn, due to the relatively small polar head group, imposes negative curvature stress on the membrane. Acyl chain unsaturation in PtdEtn further increases the non-bilayer propensity of this PL, creating lipid-packing defects that facilitate membrane fusion and influence the binding and activity of peripheral membrane proteins [

Though in comparatively low abundance, PtdSer and PtdIns are crucial determinants of membrane surface charge and, further on, mediate operational connections with positively charged portions of membrane proteins, both peripheral and integral [
