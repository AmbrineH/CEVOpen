<p class="p">The plasma membrane, endosomes and lysosomes depend completely on lipid transport from other organelles (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]). Lipid transport can occur by several mechanisms. The first mechanism is diffusion: lipids can laterally diffuse through membrane continuities, such as those that exist between the ER and the ONM and INM. Membrane contact sites (MCS) with ER were reported for almost every other organelle. MCS are defined as confluence points where the membranes of two organelles are positioned close to each other so as to offer a milieu where proteins in one membrane are accessible to the opposite membrane. Indeed, MCS are the purpose-built platforms for the allocation of distinct classes of lipids from the ER to other organelles using non-vesicular transport. This transfer is mediated by lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), which, in MCS, can easily reach the lipid molecules to be transferred between organelles (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B114-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]). Tubular connections have been observed between Golgi cisternae. On the contrary, mitochondria and peroxisomes do not take part into the vesicle transport system and lipids are probably coming in and out of these organelles as monomers, aided by both water-soluble and membrane-based proteins (revised in [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]). The second mechanism is fusion: the major membrane transport pathway between cellular organelles in the secretory and endocytic pathways is through the budding and fusion of membrane vesicles. Particularly remarkable is the transport of Chol between ER and the PM. The PM concentrates 80% of total cellular cholesterol but lacks sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). In contrast, the ER membrane, with less than 1% of total cellular cholesterol, contains both SREBPs and the sensors controlling SREBP activation [

 <xref rid="B116-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>]). Careful coordination of the lipid transport between PM and ER enables ER cholesterol sensors to continuously follow PM cholesterol content [
 <xref rid="B117-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. Control of the carrying of cholesterol from the PM to the ER is governed by the arrangement of cholesterol in PM, which in turn is crucially restrained by the connection of cholesterol with SM [
