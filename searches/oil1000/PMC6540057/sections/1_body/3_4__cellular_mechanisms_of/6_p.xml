 <xref rid="B122-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. Against this lipidome flexibility, the fluidity and packaging of the membranes remained intact in this neural model, suggesting that physical homeostasis prevails over changes in lipid composition [
 <xref rid="B122-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. A very tempting prospect might be that instead of preserving membrane lipid compositions, cells pursue the retention of their attributes by adjusting the multifactorial lipidome (reviewed in [
