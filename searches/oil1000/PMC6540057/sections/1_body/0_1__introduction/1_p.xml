<p class="p">Biological membranes define cell boundaries and internal organelles in eukaryotes. These assemblies are highly dynamic in order to allow maintenance of the integrity and identity of the enclosed structures [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] encouraged the study of membranes and the role of each of their components. Membranes are formed by a fluid lipid bilayer which confers exceptional physical properties to the cell [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and whose lipids interact with proteins by hydrophobic and Coulomb forces [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. These interactions allow membranes to create a variety of domains based on the type of lipid components [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Those domains, in turn, conform different structures and exert specific functions, such as the propagation of different cell signals [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. To maintain their structure, membranes also interact with cytoskeleton [
