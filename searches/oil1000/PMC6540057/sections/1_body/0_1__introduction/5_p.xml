<p class="p">Four billion years of evolution that began with prokaryotic cells produced the current eukaryotic cells containing different organelles with a particular membrane composition and function. Membrane lipid composition in the plasma membrane (PM) and endomembrane compartments is responsible of sustaining organelle structure and function and is reviewed here. Studying the diversity of lipid species in membranes has become a field of research in itself. Eukaryotic cell membranes are formed by hundreds of lipid species assembled following a functional asymmetry [

What is more, alterations in membrane lipid composition generate pathological conditions in cells and manipulating the membrane lipid composition is a therapeutic approach beginning to be exploited with strategies like membrane lipid therapy.
