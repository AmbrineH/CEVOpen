<p class="p">The first cellular systems on Earth arose from three molecular species: molecules which stored information for replication, catalysts encoded by that information and molecules which could encapsulate both previous species [

 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In fact, as reviewed by Gould, ATP synthase is conserved in bacteria and archaea while membrane lipids are not, which points to the fact that lipid biosynthesis was a late step in the emergence of cells, but an essential trait to acquire a free-living state [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Although we can find prokaryotes with internal compartments, none of them have developed the endomembrane system eukaryotes possess [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and these structures are not homologous to eukaryotic structures [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya) have replication machinery, transcription, translation and key metabolic pathways, which suggest that these systems must have been already present in proto-eukaryotes [
