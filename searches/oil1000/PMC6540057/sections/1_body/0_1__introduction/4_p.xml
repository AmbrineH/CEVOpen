<p class="p">Eukaryogenesis increased cell complexity by creating new membranous compartments which carry out specialized functions and vesicle trafficking with a specific source and destination [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The development of this trafficking system, as reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], has been explained by two different hypotheses over the years: endosymbiotic theory and autogenesis. In modern studies, eukaryotes derive from the integration of proteobacterium (now mitochondria) into archaeal cells, however, the complexity of the archaeal ancestor at that time is still subject to debate [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Evidence such as the similarity between mitochondria-derived vesicles and prokaryotes’ outer membrane vesicles support this theory [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Another controversial point is the speed of this trafficking-system evolution. The last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) did probably possess an internal complexity so the evolution might have been fast [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. According to the presence of different organelles, the LECA is told to have possessed a basic membrane-trafficking system including an endoplasmic reticulum, stacked Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes, which are now shared by all studied eukaryotes [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In fact, there is a common core of protein factors involved in transport and compartment specificity [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Genomic studies further demonstrate these LECA features studying the members of the coat protein complex I and II (COPI, COPII) and clathrin complexes, and on the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) families, Guanosine-5’-triphosphate hydrolases (GTPase)–activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and NSF ATPases, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) complexes, GTPases and homologues of the retromer complex (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]). Different organelles share homologous membrane-trafficking components originated from gene duplication which might have occurred simultaneously to organelle formation or might even be itself responsible for organelle development [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In addition, other trafficking components were apparently added separately while some others were lost throughout membrane evolution in the adaptation of LECA’s descendants to new environments [
