<p class="p">Membranes are essential for cell survival and can provide us with information about the origin of life and other events in cell history (e.g., bioenergetic organelles acquisition or endomembrane system formation) [

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and the origins and evolution of the membrane trafficking system have not been properly addressed [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. To study the evolution of membranes, the nature optimization of biological properties has to be taken into account [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For many years, different types of cells were distinguished by the presence (eukaryotes) or absence (prokaryotes) of a nucleus. We now know that prokaryotes can also be separated into bacteria and archaea which share many characteristics and come from a common ancestor called LUCA (last universal common ancestor) [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. One differential trait between archaea and bacteria is their different lipid membrane composition due to differences in the enzymes that synthesize them [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Eukaryotes, which were formed later in life history, have a similar lipid biochemistry to bacteria, but not to archaea (reviewed in [
