<p class="p">Initially described as pure barriers, biological membranes are currently viewed as active players in cell and organelle architecture and physiology. Lipid composition peculiarities of the different cell compartments is behind their specific structural properties and functionalities. Indeed, lipid dysregulation is a relevant factor in the etiology of many diseases. To exploit these new therapeutic avenues, lipids (both natural and synthetic) are being developed as potential drugs for different conditions using the MLT approach and are bound to constitute alternative or innovative therapies for fields in which there are no available or promising treatments.</p>
