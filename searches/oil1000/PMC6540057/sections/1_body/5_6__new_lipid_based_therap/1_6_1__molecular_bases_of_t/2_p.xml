 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Proteins involved in cell signaling interact with these microdomains and assemble crucial signaling platforms whose alteration might be pathological [

 <xref rid="B127-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. Thus, MLT aims to alter this protein signaling by modifying the composition and structure of the membrane microdomains and subsequently modulate cell signaling, offering potentially effective treatments for a variety of conditions [

 <xref rid="B195-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>]. The overall membrane lipid composition, the composition of membrane microdomains or the composition of internal organelles can be targeted by natural or modified lipids or drugs [
