<p class="p">In the above sections it was made clear that many cell functions take place in membranes and their surroundings [
 <xref rid="B160-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>]. Furthermore, it was reviewed how membrane components participate in functions altered in many human diseases [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Those functions include changing the localization of key proteins in the cell, in turn, altering key protein-protein interactions in membrane microdomains. Subsequently, signaling cascades are altered and correct functioning of the cell is compromised. Hence, the new therapeutic approach, membrane lipid therapy (MLT), aims to target membrane components to modify membrane composition or structure, i.e., the drug-induced regulation of membrane lipid composition and structure [
 <xref rid="B113-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. This strategy has shown not only efficacy, but also higher specificity and safety, and has become a potential alternative to conventional drugs [
