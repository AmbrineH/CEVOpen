<p class="p">Lysosomal lipids are fully obtained by lipid transport from other organelles particularly through the budding and fusion of membrane vesicles. Lysosomes form contact sites with organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the ER. Through this contact sites Chol is transported between organelles, among other activities (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B96-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]). For instance, exogenous TG, sterols and PL transported by low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) first enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and secondly, they are processed by the lysosome. Endogenous lipids are also sorted by the lysosome when it fuses with double-membraned autophagosomes. Hence, the role of lysosomes is well-established in lipid catabolism and in dietary lipid overload, when cellular lipid content or composition induces changes to alter autophagic activity in a tissue-specific manner (reviewed in [
