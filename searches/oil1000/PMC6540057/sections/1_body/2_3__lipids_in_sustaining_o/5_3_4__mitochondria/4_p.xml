<p class="p">Recent mass spectrometry-based lipidome analyses confirmed lipid species patterns described in mitochondria with earlier analysis techniques. Lipidome analyses fully recapitulate the found differences in FA composition of every lipid class, while this is only partially true for organelles. The role of mitochondrial lipids is now recognized for almost all lipid classes. Some of these lipids of mitochondrial membrane might be dispensable, but most contribute to the structural and functional characteristics of this organelle in a quite specific manner. Particularly mitochondrial lipids were shown to be a feasible target to modulate of the arrangement of mitochondrial supercomplexes (reviewed in [
