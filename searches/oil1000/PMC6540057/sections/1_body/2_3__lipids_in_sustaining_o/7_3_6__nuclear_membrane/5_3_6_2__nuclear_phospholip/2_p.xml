<p class="p">PL in the nucleus can be found far from the membranes linked to water-soluble proteins. PLâ€™s presence in the nucleoplasm was reported for sterols, PL, sphingosines, and very hydrophobic FA where those molecules were implicated in transcriptional regulation (reviewed in [

This family involves ligand-regulated transcription factors exerting both the activation and repression of transcription. Identified ligands include some PL, hydrophobic, Chol-based molecules (e.g., steroids and oxy-sterols), and FA (reviewed in [
