<p class="p">Cell nucleus contains GPL, SL, and Chol. Major nuclear GPL include polyphosphoinositides (PPIn) including phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PInsP), phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (PtdIns(1,4,5)P3), PtdChol, PtdSer, and PtdEtn. SL include SM, Cer, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), Sph, S1P and gangliosides as well as Chol and its hydroxyl and oxygenated derivatives. Total GPL contents of nuclei are reported as 3% by weight compared with 75% for protein and 22% for DNA. Cellular nuclei contain high levels of PtdCho and SM, which are partially linked with Chol and proteins to form lipidâ€“protein complexes. The most abundant nuclear SL is SM and is the most prominent member of the SL contributing to the signaling through NE [
