<p class="p">SM not only occurs in the nuclear envelope, but also at intranuclear sites. Nuclear lipids exert different functions upon their localization, including the regulation of fluidity of both NM and nuclear matrix. Another function of nuclear lipids is serving as platforms in signal transduction for vitamin and hormone receptors and for anchoring active chromatin. Furthermore, nuclear lipids play a role in DNA duplication and the regulation of gene expression and transcription (reviewed in [

The nucleus further hosts the metabolizing enzymes for gangliosides and Cer, including sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) and sphingomyelinase (SMase), ceramide kinase (CerK) and sphingosine kinase (SphK) activities (reviewed in [
