<p class="p">Eukaryotic nucleus encloses this chromatin using a double membrane (nuclear envelope, NE). NE includes three interconnected domains with morphological differences: the inner (INM) and outer (ONM) nuclear membranes (NM) and the pore membranes. These two individual lipid bilayers are separated by a luminal space, of 30â€“50 nm in human cells, named lumen or perinuclear space. Both the INM and ONM possess unique composition and metabolic/signaling patterns (reviewed in [
