<p class="p">During NE reassembly after cell division, cell needs to adjust the proper nuclear size. With this aim, cells adjust the portion of ER membrane integrated into the NE (first integrated into the ONM and then integrated into the INM). A possible mechanism to adjust this integration is limiting the movement of PL from the ONM to the INM by using nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) as a steric barrier profiting from their location at the intersection of both membranes. Another possible mechanism to modulate nuclear size also involves NPCs, those structures affect PL metabolism by constraining the subcellular position of the effector enzymes. This is the case of lipin and numerous other lipid-generating proteins recognized in the NE proteome (reviewed in [
