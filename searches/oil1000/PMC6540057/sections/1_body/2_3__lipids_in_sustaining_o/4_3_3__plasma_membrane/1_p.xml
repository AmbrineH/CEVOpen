<p class="p">Different cell types contain different lipid and protein compositions of their PM. Furthermore, PM is compartmentalized into microdomains with specific physico-chemical properties, e.g., signalosomes, the platforms where signaling partners exert productive interactions. Those microdomains are defined by the specific type and abundance of a given collection of proteins and lipids, including fatty acid specific composition of the latter. As an example, the cis-monounsaturated FA, oleic acid, leads the arrangement of nonlamellar phases in model membranes, in contrast to its saturated and trans-monounsaturated counterparts (stearic and elaidic, respectively) [

 <xref rid="B45-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Lipid rafts are rich in SM, GSLs and Chol which arrange into rigid and liquid-ordered (Lo) microdomains. In contrast, the small polar heads of PtdEtn endow PtdEtn-rich regions with more fluidity and less surface packing density and pressure, these regions are then called liquid-disordered (Ld) microdomains [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Lipid heterogeneous distribution gives rise to both transient and stable membrane microdomains. Transient membrane microdomains include lipid rafts, caveolae and coated pits, among others, while stable membrane microdomains involve tight junctions, synaptosomes, brush border, etc. This segregation between transient and stable membrane microdomains is led by specific proteins and remarkably by lipids such as Chol [
