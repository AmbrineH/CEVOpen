<p class="p">All along the endocytic pathway, the presence and abundance of specific lipids was found to be finely tuned. While early endosome lipid composition matches pretty much that of the PM, alongside maturation to late endosomes, sterols and PtdSer are decreased in favor of a massive rise in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BmP) [

 <xref rid="B69-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. A dedicated collection of kinases and phosphatases generate and terminate specific phosphoinositides, among them phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) on plasma membranes, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) on early endosomes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) on late endosomes and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) on the (trans)-Golgi network [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. As already mentioned, the production of SL may have an important role in the sorting of membrane proteins and lipids between the ER, the plasma membrane and endosomes, or the vacuole through lipid rafts.
