 <xref rid="B65-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Remarkably, the role of PL in internalization and maturation is biologically so significant among different phyla that it has been conserved during evolution. In all eukaryotic organisms and their compartments, PL work as membrane identifiers, controlling the circulation of individual compartments (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]). PL are not only bulk building units of membranes, but also operational controllers of main physiological events e.g., cytokinesis, chemotaxis and exocytosis. In addition, PL confer plasticity to biological membranes, for instance the PM continuously undergoes deformation, invagination, scission and fusion. Intracellular budding from the PM is the starting point of endocytosis (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]). Endocytosis comprehends several unrelated internalization routes, e.g., phagocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. PM lipids are continuously endocytosed and later recycled in return to the PM (reviewed in [
