<p class="p">Mammalian Golgi is the main producer of SL: SM, GlcCer, lactosylceramide (LacCer) and higher-order GSLs, whose final destination is the PM [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. For SL production in the lumen of the trans-Golgi, Cer issued by the ER is required [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Later on, SL will accumulate in the PM whereas SL levels in the ER will be low. As it happens with SL, sterols are scarce in the ER, representing only 5 mol% of lipids, in contrast to the trans-Golgi and PM where sterols are abundant (30 mol%â€“40 mol%) [
