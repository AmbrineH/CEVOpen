<p class="p">The secretory pathway is the best characterized model of lipid localization and involves the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and PM. These three compartments display growing amounts of Chol and SL concentrations, with higher levels in PM. In fact, this Chol and SL gradient is responsible of the increased membrane thickness and stiffness of the PM. These two physical properties (thickness and stiffness) are crucial to determine the particular functions and identities of the different organelles. Furthermore, they might be related with the sorting of membrane proteins and lipids between the organelles. Because of this, lipid composition and, further on, membrane thickness and stiffness, must be homeostatically maintained [
