<p class="p">Cholesterol (Chol) is a crucial element of mammalian cell membranes. Chol molecule involves four fused rings (steroid backbone) showing a hydroxyl group (A-ring) and a small branched hydrophobic tail (D-ring). In membranes, the rigid steroid backbone of Chol favors its interaction with SL. Chol-SL platforms are the basic element of lipid rafts. Chol content is strictly controlled by three mechanisms: de novo synthesis, uptake and esterification [
