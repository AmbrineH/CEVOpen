<p class="p">Glycerophospholipids (GPL) are the major structural lipids in eukaryotic membranes. They are generally composed of two fatty acids linked through two hydrophobic acyl chains and a phosphate head group ester linked to a glycerol. In GPL, the phosphate moiety of the resulting phosphatidic acid is further esterified with choline, ethanolamine, serine or inositol in the phospholipid itself. Therefore, GPL branch from phosphatidic acid (PA) and are classified upon the structure of the PL head group. Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) heads are zwitterionic, whereas phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) heads are anionic (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). Each of these phospholipid classes is defined by a shared structure but then includes a battery of molecular species upon the length and degree of saturation in their acyl chains. Both head group and acyl chain composition influence the physical properties of the membrane [
