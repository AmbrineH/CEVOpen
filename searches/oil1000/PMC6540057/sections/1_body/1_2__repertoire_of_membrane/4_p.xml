<p class="p">Sphingolipids (SL) are the second most abundant structural lipid. SL contain one hydrophobic acyl chains and a phosphate head group ester linked to a Sph backbone. Their hydrophobic backbone is an ester or amide derivative of Sph with fatty acids being ceramide (Cer) the simplest representative. Sphingomyelin (SM) contains a phosphorylcholine headgroup associated to the sphingoid base. SM is the more abundant SL in the plasma membrane (PM) of mammalian cells. Within the total PL fraction of the PM, SM accounts for 2%â€“15% upon the cell type (reviewed in [
