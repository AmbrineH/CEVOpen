   <p class="p">PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentration is also elevated in numerous cancers. This example of abnormal lipid catabolism is due to ineffective degradation by the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) [

   <p class="p">Total SM levels are decreased and PtdEtn levels are increased in tumor cells compared to non-tumor controls [
    <xref rid="B138-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. As a consequence, the PtdEtn:SM ratio in tumor cells is ca. 10-fold the ratio in normal cells. In fact, PtdEtn:SM ratio might work as a switch where high PtdEtn:SM ratio is a ‘ON’ state allowing propagation of proliferation signals received at the PM, while a low PtdEtn:SM ratio is a ‘OFF’ state where the PM is impaired for transduction of proliferative signals [

Other proteins related to FA biosynthesis and lipid metabolism regulation, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), Insulin induced gene 1 (INSIG1), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), are highly expressed in breast cancer tumors and associated with low patient survival [
