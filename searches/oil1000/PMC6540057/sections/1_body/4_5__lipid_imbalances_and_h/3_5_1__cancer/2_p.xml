   <p class="p">Disruption of normal tissue architecture: The collapse of normal tissue architecture is a mark of malignancy. Polarized epithelia turn into disorganized structures that can occupy the adjacent tissues. In epithelial tissues, aberrant FA synthesis was linked to the loss of cell polarity. Also, the ordinary expression of SREBPs is needed to maintain the apical surface of normal epithelial cells and is lost in many cancers (reviewed in [

   <p class="p">Lipid metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells: cancer cells display an enlarged metabolic inventory that allows the flexibility to survive and grow in the severe tumor environment. Highly proliferative cancer cells display a strong lipid and Chol avidity, which they fulfill by raising the incorporation of exogenous (or dietary) lipids or increasing their endogenous synthesis. Excessive lipids and cholesterol in cancer cells stored in lipid droplets are considered marks of cancer aggressiveness (reviewed in [
