<p class="p">Several lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) affect lysosomal hydrolases, membrane transporters, accessory or trafficking proteins and derive into lipid storage disorders (sphingolipidoses, gangliosidoses, leukodystrophies) (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]). The most common LSD is Gaucher disease (GD), which impairs the function of (lyso)glucosylceramide degrading enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (EC 3.2.1.45). Fabry disease (FD), in contrast, develops with deficiency of the lysosomal α-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22). Krabbe disease (KD) interferes with the function of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase (EC: 3.2.1.46), so that undegraded galactolipids accumulate and cause the progressive demyelination of cells in the nervous system. Niemann–Pick type C disease originates by intralysosomal Chol and SL accumulation and develops with severe neurological and visceral pathology (reviewed in [

Another example is Tay Sachs disease, a rare inherited disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. This disease is a type of sphingolipidosis which shows toxic accumulation of the molecule GM2 ganglioside within cells [
