<p class="p">Although, only a few prenyltransferase substrates (e.g., Ras family GTPases and heterotrimeric G-proteins) have been identified, this modification is essential for the proper activity of some proteins which are altered in different diseases. This is the basis for the efforts made in the therapeutic targeting of protein prenylation. Inhibitors of prenylation have been tested for the treatment of cancer, parasite causing diseases, viral and bacterial infections, multiple sclerosis or progeria [
