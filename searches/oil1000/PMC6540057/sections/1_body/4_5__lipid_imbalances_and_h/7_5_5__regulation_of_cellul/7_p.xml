<p class="p">Other protein susceptible to be targeted by prenylation inhibitors include proteins being exclusively farnesylated (e.g., HRAS and RAS homologue enriched in brain –RHEB) or geranylgeranylated (e.g., RHOA, RHOC, RALA and RALB); although some can be both farnesylated or geranylgeranylated (e.g., RHOB) or become geranylgeranylated when farnesylation is inhibited (e.g., KRAS, as said above, and HRAS). Other prenylation inhibitors’ targets include tumor suppressors (such as ARHI, RERG, DBC2, RIG, RRP22) and other proteins (such as CENPE, CENPF, PRL phosphatases, lamin A and B, HDJ2, RND3, PEX19, RHOD, RHO6, RHO7, TC10 and PTGIR) (reviewed in [
