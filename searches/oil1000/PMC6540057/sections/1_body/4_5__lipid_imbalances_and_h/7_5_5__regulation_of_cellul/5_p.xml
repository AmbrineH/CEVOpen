<p class="p">Proteins involved in signal transduction pathways require prenylation. An interesting example of these proteins is Ras protein family. Many cancers present activating mutations in the RAS genes causing malignant activity of the protein [
 <xref rid="B189-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">189</xref>]. For this reason, prenyltransferase inhibitors have been tested in vitro and in animals for the inhibition of Ras proteins, showing promising results. Firstly, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) were used to inhibit the farnesylation of proteins in cancer cells. FTIs promoted apoptosis, cell cycle arrest (mainly mitotic arrest at prometaphase) and inhibition of proliferation, cell migration and angiogenesis by affecting signal transduction pathways such as RAF-MEK-MAPK or PI3K-Akt and other oncogenic and survival pathways [

 <xref rid="B190-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">190</xref>] with only several patients responding to FTIs both alone and in combination with other agents. In sum, some tumors depend on farnesylated proteins for survival, but further development is needed to apply this knowledge to the clinic [
