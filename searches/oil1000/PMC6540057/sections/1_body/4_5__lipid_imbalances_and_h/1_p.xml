 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02167-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Those changes in the cell membrane lipid composition, in turn, affect the biophysical properties of microdomains and the ability of signal propagation by proteins and signaling lipids (reviewed in [

With further detail, PL regulate endocytic processes which are required for properly regulated growth, immune surveillance, synaptic transmission, cell migration, and many other functions. Hence, alterations in PL metabolism during endocytosis were reported in chronic infections, metastatic tumors, and neurological disorders (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-20-02167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]). A further example involves human disorders, such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease and type II diabetes, which develop with accumulations of peptide and protein fibrillar aggregates. In those cases, oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity does not depend simply on the protein aggregates themselves, but also on the chemical composition and physicochemical features of the cell membranes with which the oligomers interact [
