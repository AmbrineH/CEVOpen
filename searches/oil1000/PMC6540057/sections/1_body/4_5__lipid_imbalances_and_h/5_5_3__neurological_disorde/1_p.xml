<p class="p">The neural membrane lipid composition has been reported to change in neurodegeneration. Particularly, changes affected GPL, SL, and Chol levels both in acute neural trauma (head injury, ischemia, and spinal cord trauma) and in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). In accordance, significant increased levels of in GPL-, SL-, and Chol-derived lipid mediators have been shown to accompany these variations in lipid composition both in the PM and in the cell nucleus (reviewed in [
