<p class="p">Already thousands of years ago chia seeds were staple food and they were consumed by pre-Columbian peoples living primarily in Central America. In recent years, we have been observing considerable interest in this raw material in relation to its high nutritive value. Chia seeds have high contents of dietary fibre and proteins, rich in many exogenous amino acids. Moreover, chia seeds have high contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly alfa-linolenic acid, belonging to the group of omega-3 fatty acids. These seeds are also a good source of many minerals and vitamins, as well as bioactive compounds of high antioxidant activity, particularly polyphenols and tocopherols. Current research results indicate many health-promoting properties of chia seeds. These seeds are ascribed a beneficial effect on the improvement of the blood lipid profile. Experiments confirmed their hypotensive, hypoglycaemic, antimicrobial and immunostimulatory effects. Due to the capacity of chia seeds to absorb water and to form gels, they may be used in food technology as a substitute of emulsifiers and stabilisers. In conclusion, chia seeds (
