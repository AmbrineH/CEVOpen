<p class="p">There are numerous proposals on the use of chia in dishes. Chia are characteristic because of the possibility of attractive looking gels and the seeds are used in the form of seed flour or whole seeds. Currently, chia seeds are used in Europe as a component of cereal products, e.g., breakfast cereals, rice crisps, wafers, chips. The use of chia seeds in production of dairy products, fruit and vegetables or meat stuffs have great perspectives. Although there are many gastronomical recipes for food products with chia seeds, at present, their industrial application is hindered by the mentioned legal status of the seed as a novel food ingredient. It means that a food business operator is required to obtain the official premarket approval for each chia product not included in the Union list of authorised novel foods and novel food ingredients, which is established by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on novel foods, amending Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1852/2001 (OJ 327, 11.12.2015, p.1). </p>
