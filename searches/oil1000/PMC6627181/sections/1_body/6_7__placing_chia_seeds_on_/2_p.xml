<p class="p">Within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283, 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia hispanica</italic> (chia) seeds fall into category IV of novel food, namely food consisting of or isolated from, or produced from plants or their parts (Article 3 paragraph 2 point (a) (iv)) [
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. For the purpose of further considerations, it is worth noting that chia seeds are an example of traditional food from third country. Briefly, according to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 such a food means novel food which is derived from primary production with a history of safe use in a third country. In turn, the safe use in a third country means that safety of the food in question has been confirmed with compositional data and from experience of continued use for at least 25 years in the customary diet of a significant number of people in at least one third country. As already mentioned at the beginning of this article, chia seeds were staple food for peoples inhabiting Central America in pre-Colombian times and currently they are consumed as ingredients or additions to many foodstuffs.
