<p class="p">The advantageous effect of chia seeds on the blood lipid profile was shown in an experiment conducted by Chicco et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. They observed that rats fed a diet with high sucrose contents and containing 2.6% chia seeds had lower blood concentrations of triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids and total cholesterol in comparison to the control. In that study, no changes were recorded in blood glucose concentration. Additionally, in rats consuming chia seeds, a reduction of visceral fat level was observed [

 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], who reported lower blood concentrations of NEFA and TAG in rats, which were administered feed containing chia seeds, in comparison to the control, in which chia seeds were replaced with corn oil. Additionally, those researchers recorded a lower hepatic TAG level in those animals. That study analysed the effect of chia seed consumption on the activity of selected enzymes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids. It was found that animals fed chia seeds had lower levels of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity in comparison to animals fed a diet rich in corn oil. Additionally, in rats consuming seeds, they recorded a higher activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), participating in beta-oxidation of lipids [
