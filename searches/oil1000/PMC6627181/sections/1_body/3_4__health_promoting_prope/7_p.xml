<p class="p">The effect of consumption of ground chia seeds on blood levels of selected fatty acids in postmenopausal women was assessed in a study conducted by Jin et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. They showed that a daily intake of 25 g chia seeds during a seven-week dietary intervention caused an increase in blood concentrations of alfa-linoleic acid (by 138%) and eicosapentaenoic acid (by 30%). No differences were observed in the levels of docosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic acids [
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In experiments conducted with 12 healthy volunteers Vertommen et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] showed that one-month administration of chia seeds at 50 g daily contributed to a reduction of waist circumference with no simultaneous change in body weight. Moreover, in the participants they recorded a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 66.1 to 61.5 mmHg and a reduced blood triglyceride concentration from 89 to 69 mg/dL [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Segura-Campos et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] showed that hydrolysates of chia seed proteins show an activity inhibiting angiotensin convertase (ACE). They observed that the inhibition of activity of the enzyme converting angiotensin is dependent on the duration of hydrolysis. The highest activity was recorded in hydrolysates obtained at 150 min (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 8.86 ug protein/mL), while it was lowest in hydrolysates produced within the time of 90 min (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 44.01 ug/mL) [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The inhibitory effect in relation to the activity of angiotensin convertase by fractions of proteins found in chia seeds was confirmed in an experiment performed by Orona-Tamayo et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. In their study among the analysed protein fractions (albumin, globulin, prolamin, and glutelin), the strongest action inhibiting ACE activity was observed for globulin and albumin. Nieman et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] did not confirm the hypolipemizing action and the effect lowering arterial blood pressure of chia seeds. Consumption of 50 g chia seeds a day by obese men and obese women over a period of 12 weeks caused no changes in values of analysed parameters. No statistically significant differences were recorded in glucose level; concentrations of LDL, HDL and total cholesterol; and blood triglyceride level in comparison to the placebo group. No changes were observed in the concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as cytokines: interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP). In that study, a simultaneous increase was found for the blood plasma concentration of alfa-lipoic acid (ALA) in a group of individuals consuming chia seeds. In contrast, no changes were recorded in the concentration of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Similar research results were reported by Nieman et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], who supplemented overweight women aged 49–75 years with a dose of 25 g chia seeds daily for a period of 10 weeks. Among the study participants they reported no changes in the concentration of total cholesterol or blood glucose level. No effect was shown on arterial blood pressure or the level of C-reactive protein. No changes were found in the concentrations of analysed cytokines: interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 10 (IL-10) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α). In contrast, in the blood of female participants following the consumption of ground chia seeds an increase was recorded in the level of alfa-lipoic acid (by 58%) and eicosapentaenoic acid (by 39%). At the same time, no changes were found in ALA and EPA levels in the group of individuals consuming whole chia seeds [
