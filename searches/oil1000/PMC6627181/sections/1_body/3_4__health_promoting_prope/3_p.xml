<p class="p">Other researchers investigated the influence of chia oil supplementation on body composition and insulin signalling in skeletal muscles of obese mice [
 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The results indicate that mice treated with chia oil show reduced fat mass accumulation and increased lean mass, improved glucose levels and insulin tolerance, and increased blood levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Creus et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] reported that dietary chia seeds improve the altered metabolic fate of glucose and reduce increased collagen deposition in the heart of dyslipidaemic insulin-resistant rats fed a sucrose-rich diet.
