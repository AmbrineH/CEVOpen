<p class="p">The antioxidant properties of chia seed may be used, as well as other natural substances (extract of rosemary, extract of tea, gingko biloba extract, phenolic compounds) to protect the lipids and biologically active substances in the oil during storage and use of thermal processes and in new designed food [

 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], obese rats were fed chia seeds or chia seed oil at 133 and 40 g/kg diet, respectively, for 6 or 12 weeks. Among animals consuming seeds or oil a statistically significant increase was observed in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in blood i.e., that of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase (GRd), in comparison to the group of animals fed a high-fructose diet with no chia supplementation. No differences were recorded in the concentration of superoxide dismutase (SOD). At the same time, in the case of hepatic antioxidant enzymes they reported an increase in the activity of glutathione reductase and glutathione (only for chia seeds consumed for a period of 12 weeks). In relation to the other enzymes, no differences were observed in their activity. In the same study, after consumption of both chia seeds and chia oil, a reduction was found in blood concentrations of lipid peroxidation biomarkers: 8-isoprostane and malondialdehyde (MDA). No changes were recorded in MDA concentration in livers of the experimental animals [
