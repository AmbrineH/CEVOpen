<p class="p">Adequate nutrition is an important element in the prevention of many civilisation-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity. Both state institutions and non-governmental organisations issue nutritional recommendations to protect human health, inhibit the development of selected diseases and alleviate their symptoms [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. An increasingly important health-promoting role is ascribed to bioactive food components. They were defined by Biesalski and co-workers as nutritional components or non-nutritional compounds naturally found in the raw material or formed in the product in the course of technological processes, which may enhance, inhibit or modify physiological and metabolic functions of the organism [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The American Dietetic Association supplements this definition by additionally stressing the importance of health safety of bioactive food [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Bioactive compounds include, e.g., polyphenols, carotenoids, phytoestrogens, sterols, stanols, vitamins, dietary fibre, fatty acids, probiotics, prebiotics, and bioactive peptides [

 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In view of the health-promoting properties of food in recent years we have been observing a considerable interest in products of plant origin, which have been investigated in many studies [

 <italic class="italic">Salvia hispanica</italic>, commonly called chia. The word “chia” is a Spanish adaptation of “chian” or “chien”, originating from Nahuati and meaning “oily”. Chia is an herbaceous plant that has also been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years [

The aim of this article is to present current information concerning potential use of chia seeds in the food industry, focusing on their chemical composition and health-promoting properties as well as legal acts regulating their use in food production.
