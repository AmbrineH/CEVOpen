<p class="p">The chemical composition of chia seeds has been analysed in many studies. Detailed data on basic chia seeds composition is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01242-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Chia seeds are ascribed high nutritive value particularly thanks to their high contents of dietary fibre and fat (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01242-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Chia seeds contain approximately 30–34 g dietary fibre, of which the insoluble fraction (IDF) accounts for approximately 85–93%, while soluble dietary fibre (SDF) is approximately 7–15% [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In terms of dietary fibre content, chia seeds exceed dried fruits, cereals or nuts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-01242-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The fatty acid profile is of particular interest. It is characterised by high contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly α-linolenic acid (ALA), which accounts for approximately 60% all fatty acids. Linoleic, oleic and palmitic acids are found in lower amounts (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01242-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Chia seeds have greater contents of omega-3 acids than flaxseed. We also need to stress the advantageous ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 acids, which is approximately 0.3:0.35 [

 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,

 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Chia seeds are also a good source of plant protein, which accounts for approximately 18–24% their mass [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Analyses of the amino acid composition (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01242-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) confirmed the presence of 10 exogenous amino acids, among which the greatest contents were for arginine, leucine, phenylalanine, valine and lysine. Proteins in chia seeds are also rich in endogenous amino acids, mainly glutamic and aspartic acids, alanine, serine and glycine [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. It needs to be stressed that chia seeds are gluten-free and as such may be consumed by celiac patients [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Moreover, chia seeds supply many minerals, with phosphorus (860–919 mg/100 g), calcium (456–631 mg/100 g), potassium (407–726 mg/100g) and magnesium (335–449 mg/100 g) found in greatest amounts [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Studies also confirmed the presence of some vitamins, mainly vitamin B1 (0.6 mg/100 g), vitamin B2 (0.2 mg/100 g) and niacin (8.8 mg/100 g) [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Chia seeds are also a rich source of particularly interesting groups of phytocompounds characterised by high biological activity [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. These are particularly polyphenols: gallic, caffeic, chlorogenic, cinnamic and ferulic acids, quercetin, kaempferol, epicatechin, rutin, apigenin and p-coumaric acid. Isoflavones, such as daidzein, glycitein, genistein and genistin, are found in small amounts (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01242-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Ciftci et al. showed the presence of campesterol (472 mg/kg of lipids), stigmasterol (1248 mg/kg of lipids), β-sitosterol (2057 mg/kg of lipids) and Δ5-avenasterol [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-01242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Moreover, it was found that chia seeds also contain tocopherols: α-tocopherol (8 mg/kg of lipids), γ-tocopherol (422 mg/kg of lipids) and δ-tocopherol (15 mg/kg of lipids).
