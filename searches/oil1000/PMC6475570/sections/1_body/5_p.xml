<p class="p">P. Soundararajan et al. presented a detailed review entitled “Insight on Rosaceae Family with Genome Sequencing and Functional Genomics Perspective.” The Rosaceae family is one of the most significant plant families, and the fruits, berries, flowers, and many other important parts of these plants are familiar to each of us from early childhood. The authors have provided a comprehensive overview on the modern level of genetic knowledge and technology employed in comparative genomics and functional genome analysis for many Rosaceae species. Whole genome sequences in this plant family are so important for genetics, breeding, and agriculture that the presented review will surely be of broad general interest to future investigations in this area.</p>
