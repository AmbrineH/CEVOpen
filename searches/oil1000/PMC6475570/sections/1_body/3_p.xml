<p class="p">IAEA also supported a study on the generation of mutant bread wheat with improved micronutrient content in the grain. S. Kenzhebayeva et al. presented their paper “Mutant Lines of Spring Wheat with Increased Iron, Zinc, and Micronutrients in Grains and Enhanced Bioavailability for Human Health,” where stable breeding lines of wheat were produced from the M
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> generation. The authors reported a two-fold increase of Fe, Zn, and Ca, and reduced levels of the anti-nutrient phytic acid in grains, which can be directly used in practical wheat breeding. In addition to radiation or chemical mutagenesis, inherited changes could be induced by “genomic shock” in plants generated through interspecies hybridization. This phenomenon was studied in rye-wheat hybrids named “secalotriticum” by Y. A. Lipikhina et al. in their paper “Dynamics of the Centromeric Histone
 <italic class="italic"> CENH3</italic> Structure in Rye-Wheat Amphidiploids (Secalotriticum).” This is an extremely intricate cytogenetic study of the centromeric nucleosomes in dividing cells. The authors presented some critical results from
 <italic class="italic"> CENH3</italic> gene analysis, a central player in this very complex cytological trait, offering promising potential outcomes.
