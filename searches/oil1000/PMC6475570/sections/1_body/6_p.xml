<p class="p">In conclusion, the review presented by N. Borisjuk et al., entitled “Genetic Modification for Wheat Improvement: From Transgenesis to Genome Editing,” summarizes the attempts and results of wheat improvement using various genetic engineering approaches. The authors reflect the progress achieved since the dawn of genetic transformation up until the recent emergence of precise modern genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 and related systems in wheat. This comprehensive review can provide a strong stimulus for both current and future researchers to pursue work on wheat improvement, and deploy all available modern technologies to secure a sustainable supply of quality agricultural produce for our growing global population.</p>
