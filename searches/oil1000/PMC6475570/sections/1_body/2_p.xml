<p class="p">Several of the presented reports are related to the genetic control of plant response to abiotic stresses. Drought is one of the major challenges being faced in agriculture. The paper presented by N. M. Kamal et al. (“Stay-Green QTLs Response in Adaptation to Post-Flowering Drought Depends on the Drought Severity”) provides important findings on QTLs identified in sorghum grown in Sudan (Africa) under drought conditions. The presented data, generated in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Austria, can be used for the improvement of grain yield in drought-prone environments using a “stay-green” approach through the application of QTL analysis. Tolerance to aluminum toxicity represents an entirely different type of abiotic stress, but this too is an important agricultural problem, especially in acidic soils. The paper “Aluminum Responsive Genes in Flax (
 <italic class="italic">Linum usitatissimum</italic> L.)” presented by G. S. Krasnov et al. reported valuable results from RNAseq analysis and candidate gene identification for flax genotypes tolerant or sensitive to a high concentration of Al. The authors' conclusions on glutathione metabolism, oxidoreductase, and transmembrane transporters can be further applied both in academic study and in practical breeding. Very few investigations have been conducted on plant growth in the absence of gravity during space-shuttle orbit around our planet. The paper presented by O. Yu. Yurkevich et al. (“Molecular Cytogenetics of
 <italic class="italic"> Pisum sativum</italic> L. Grown under Spaceflight-Related Stress”) describes a chromosome analysis of pea progenies derived from plants grown in space using a novel FISH approach. Minor chromosome rearrangements were observed in response to “spaceflight-related stress,” which could lead to better guidelines for biological experiments with plants during future space-shuttle missions.
