<p class="p">Three papers in this issue deal with the development, study, and application of molecular markers in plant breeding. N. Kim et al. in “Development of Clustered Resistance Gene Analogs-Based Markers of Resistance to
 <italic class="italic"> Phytophthora capsici</italic> in Chili Pepper” reported on 11 novel molecular markers targeting resistance to the soil-borne pathogen
 <italic class="italic"> Phytophthora capsici</italic> in chili pepper. The markers developed through high-resolution melting analysis, represent an excellent tool for marker-assisted selection. Another type of molecular markers, SSR, was used for the study of genetic diversity in cultivated and wild melon (J. Hu et al. “Microsatellite Markers Reveal Genetic Diversity and Relationships within a Melon Collection Mainly Comprising Asian Cultivated and Wild Germplasms”). The authors found enormous genetic variability within the collection, and deployment of the well-known SSR markers enabled the generation of a phylogenetic tree showing the relationships between melon accessions. An investigation presented by R. Ben Ayed and A. Rebai (“Tunisian Table Olive Oil Traceability and Quality Using SNP Genotyping and Bioinformatics Tools”) revealed a significant link between the five SNP markers analysed and the biochemical composition and quality of olive fruits.
