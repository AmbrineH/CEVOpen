<p class="p">A remarkable level of genetic polymorphism was found in a germplasm collection of
 <italic class="italic"> Phaseolus </italic>beans using diverse characteristics derived from the seed morphology of these species. L. Sinkovič et al. presented their paper “Morphological Seed Characterization of Common (
 <italic class="italic">Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L.) and Runner (
 <italic class="italic">Phaseolus coccineus</italic> L.) Bean Germplasm: A Slovenian Gene Bank Example,” which contained an interesting comparison of seeds, accompanied by color images. The presented findings are essential for a better understanding of the wide diversity of bean species, which can be directly used for genetics and breeding of these nutritionally important crop varieties. In contrast, another paper “
 <italic class="italic">In Silico</italic> Genome-Wide Analysis of the ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter Gene Family in Soybean (
 <italic class="italic">Glycine max</italic> L.) and Their Expression Profiling,” presented by A. K. Mishra et al., reported on computer analyses of available databases concerning the important gene family of the
 <italic class="italic"> ATP-binding cassette transporter</italic>, in soybean. The authors provided a very accurate and detailed analysis of all identified genes and protein isoforms, arranging these new findings within the context of other pertinent information and comparisons.
