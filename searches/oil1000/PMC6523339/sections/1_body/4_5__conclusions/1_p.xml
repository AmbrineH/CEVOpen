<p class="p">With the results obtained in this study, we conclude that Vita CAD-Temp is a material that, although widely used for other dental applications, demonstrates a cellular behavior that is similar to those of lithium disilicate (current gold standard) and is, therefore, a material suitable for use as an implant attachment in daily practice, as it helps shape the gum around the implant crown.</p>
