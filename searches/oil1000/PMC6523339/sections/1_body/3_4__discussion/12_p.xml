<p class="p">Adaptation of this fibroblast cell line depends on factors such as the material surface, cellular phenotype or composition of the material. In this study, we decided to use human fibroblasts from an immortal cell line in order to obtain results more easily extrapolated to all types of patients. Other studies use fibroblasts extracted from the connective tissue of a patient from whom the third molar or even cell lines of mice are extracted, which have antigen limitations or other intrinsic characteristics of each species that can lead to error when extrapolating the results obtained to other cases [
