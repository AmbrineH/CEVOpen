<p class="p">It is true that, although the values obtained in this study may bear some similarity to those collected in other published articles regarding roughness, it should not be compared to those irregularities, since, in this case, we carried out the profilometry study in accordance with Standard ISO 25178. As commented by Fischer et al., Kournetas et al. and Rizo-Gorrita et al., it may be necessary to revisit the need to obtain roughness parameters in a different manner for
