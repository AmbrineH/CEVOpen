<p class="p">On the one hand, IPS e.max CAD, according to the manufacturer, consists of the following compounds: SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Li
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, MgO, Al
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, P
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, ZnO and other oxides. When analyzing the discs in this study, according to EDS, we could verify there was a high proportion of silicon and oxygen. All the elements indicated by the manufacturer were present with the exception of lithium, which, due to its low molecular weight, often goes unnoticed in EDS analysis. Other authors, such as Riquieri et al., have experienced a similar situation when obtaining the results of their studies [
