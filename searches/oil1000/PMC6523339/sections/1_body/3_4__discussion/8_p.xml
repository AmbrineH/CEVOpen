<p class="p">Another study comparing these materials is that by MÃ¶rmann WH et al., which compares the surface of natural enamel with that of artificial enamel, analyzing, among other parameters, the levels of roughness using SEM. This group of researchers looked for a material that resembles the natural dentition as much as possible in order to achieve a natural surface and that prevents the appearance of biofilm on the surface. They concluded that all the materials studied behaved in an almost identical way in this regard [
