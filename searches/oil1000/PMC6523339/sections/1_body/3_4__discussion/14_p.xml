<p class="p">Traditionally, it has been said that fibroblasts adhesion is better on smooth surfaces, although there is no current consensus regarding the ideal material surface in contact with mucosa. Quicker contact has been seen on smooth surfaces, which would coincide with the results of the study in which images were taken at 24 h. An interesting question is whether there is a need to create a gingival fibroblast barrier stable enough to prevent the passage of bacteria to the area. These are capable of producing bacterial colonies in just 8 h. Provisional material such as VITA CAD Temp provides roughness with low values, as demonstrated in the results, and producing adequate cell growth and spreading can positively influence implant integrity [
