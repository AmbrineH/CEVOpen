<p class="p">This 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study has some limitations. The roughness values obtained are good for fibroblast proliferation but it could have different reaction with C. albicans adhesion and proliferation. Previous studies showed that the Ra parameter should be near 0.2 micrometers. It could be interesting to study the surface characteristics in relation to bacterial colonization in future studies [
