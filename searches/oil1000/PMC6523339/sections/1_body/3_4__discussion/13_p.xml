<p class="p">Roughness is an extensively analyzed parameter in various articles in which different implant element surfaces are studied. In the case of materials used in this study, this value is lower in the VITA CAD-Temp (0.38 ± 0.02 μm), which, according to studies, also provides comfort to patients given that friction on soft tissues is reduced (Mörmann). Pendegrass et al. concluded that cell adhesion and proliferation improved in values between 0.03 and 0.3 μm, whereas Pabst obtains values &lt;1 μm as smooth surfaces and &gt;1 μm as rough surfaces, establishing typical roughness for dental materials above 1.3 microns [
