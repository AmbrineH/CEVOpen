 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00744-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the following: On the lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD) surface, chips may be seen as a result of milling of the discs and irregularities typical of ceramic sintering. The surface of VITA CAD-Temp, on the other hand, is a more homogeneous surface where concentric grooves may be observed, resulting from the machining of the piece by the manufacturer.
