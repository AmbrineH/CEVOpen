<p class="p">We used a Sensofar S NEOX interferometric confocal microscope (Sensofar Medical, Terrassa, Spain) to obtain the roughness using SensoMAP Premium 7.4 software (Sensofar Medical, Terrassa, Spain). Then we used epifluorescent lenses 20× magnification at a length of 4.50 mm and a green optical resolution of 0.32 μm. Five random measurements were made from different locations for each material, with a pre-set dimension of 0.87 × 0.66 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and a compensation of 250 μm. These measurements are based on ISO 25178 with regards to the geometric specifications of the product. The quantitative roughness parameter used was the arithmetic mean of the standard deviation of 3D roughness (Sa).
