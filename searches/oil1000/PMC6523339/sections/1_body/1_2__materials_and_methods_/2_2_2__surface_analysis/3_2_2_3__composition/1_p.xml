<p class="p">Prior to beginning the experiment, we analyzed the surface composition of the discs using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis with a FESEM (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) that includes Schotkky diode field emission and an EDAX AMETEK SDD (AMETEK, Leicester, UK). To process the images that were obtained, we used EDAX TEAM software version 4.4.1 (AMETEK, Leicester, UK). We analyzed an area of 130 Î¼m in 200 s to obtain results expressed in mass percent composition (wt %).</p>
