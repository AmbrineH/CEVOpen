<p class="p">Using blocks of both restoration materials (definitive (IPS e.max CAD) and long-term provisional components (Vita CAD-Temp)), discs were milled using the Straumann
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> CARES
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> M Series CAD/CAM system (Straumann Group, Basel, Switzerland; tolerance value ± 3 µm). The laboratory used Software CARES
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Visual (Straumann Group, Basel, Switzerland) to design the disc and the Program 3 in the milling process (26 °C during 9 h 40 min). This CAD/CAM system works at 250 W, 60,000 rpm, irrigated with water and cutting fluid and with a precision &lt; 10 μm.
