<p class="p">To obtain microscopic images, we used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at 488 nm to capture the fluorescence emitted when passing through the cytoskeleton (collected in a filter that captured a wavelength of 535 nm). To view the nuclei, we used a DAPI excitation filter at 355 nm, capturing the fluorescence emitted at 458 nm through the filter. We carried out the entire process in accordance with the parameters recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
