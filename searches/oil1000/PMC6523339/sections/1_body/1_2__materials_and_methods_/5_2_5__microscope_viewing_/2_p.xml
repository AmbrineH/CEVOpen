<p class="p">The software we incorporated into the microscope was the Zen Lite 2012 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), through which the images could be viewed at different objectives 20×/0.8 and 40×/1.30 with immersion oil and 63×/1.40 with oil. We captured the images in five regions of interest (ROI) for each disc: north-west, north-east, center, south-west and south-east. No sample was exposed to the laser any longer than 5 min so as to prevent burning.</p>
