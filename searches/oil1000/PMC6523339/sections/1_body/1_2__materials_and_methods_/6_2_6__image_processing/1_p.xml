<p class="p">We processed the obtained images using ImageJ v1.50e software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). We saved these images in .tiff format to be viewed using this program, with 2048 × 2048 pixel dimensions. Once the images were opened and calibrated, we changed them to 8-bit. Those obtained using a 20× objective served to analyze the number of cells covering the surface, whereas those obtained at 40× and 63× served to analyze the morphology and to perform measurements of cell size.</p>
