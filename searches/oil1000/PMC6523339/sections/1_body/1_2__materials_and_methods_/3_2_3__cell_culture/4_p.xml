<p class="p">We placed the specimens of both materials onto a sterile petri dish to cultivate fibroblasts on them at a concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells in 40 μL of growth medium in each dish. After a few hours, we checked the initial cell adhesion to the disc surface using an Olympus CKX41SF2 microscope (Olympus, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan). Next, we placed the medium onto the petri dish using a pipette until it covered the surface of the discs. We incubated the cells for 24 h prior to carrying out immunohistochemical staining.
