<p class="p">When selecting an implant material, it is important to take its biocompatibility into account, as well as its cellular behavior around these surfaces. After the osseointegration period of the implants, transgingival abutments are inserted to reshape the gingival tissues. The healing of both the bone tissue and soft tissues surrounding the various surfaces of the implants is essential for clinical success [

These prostheses connect the internal environment of the soft tissue with the oral environment, which is required to create a hermetic structure where cell proliferation is generated that prevents the passage of bacteria to the peri-implant zone [

First of all, the wound healing starts with the inflammatory phase, which is followed by a proliferative phase, during which fibroblasts migrate, accumulate into the wound and produce a collagen matrix. This phase ends with the keratinocytes migration. These two cell types create the barrier. The cellsâ€™ adhesion depends on various components such as lipids, carbohidrats and bound proteins [
