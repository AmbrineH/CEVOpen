<p class="p">The other material we studied is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), widely used since the 1930s for the manufacture of removable prostheses, orthodontic appliances and splints. This is a synthetic polymer that provides strength, color stability and ease of repair, some of the essential qualities required for provisional material. Biomaterials such as PMMA may be used to maintain permanent or temporary contact with the body in order to maintain cells and tissues [

In 2005, PMMA-based polymer, Vita CAD-Temp material was introduced (VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad SÃ¤ckingen, Germany), an improved polymer that uses PMMA in its composition and enables manufacture using a CAD/CAM system. In addition to its well-known specifications, it is also used as a material for long-term provisional implant crowns due to its high modulus of elasticity and flexural strength [

 <xref rid="B19-polymers-11-00744" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Its main disadvantages are shrinkage during curing, exothermic reaction during polymerization and release of monomers into the medium. All of these are diminished when produced by a CAD/CAM system with controlled polymerization under optimum pressure and temperature (the manufacturer even ensures free monomer absence). This system also reduces laboratory costs and speeds up the process [
