 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> isolates tested in this study were recovered at the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi “Bonino-Pulejo” hospital, Messina, Italy, during a surveillance program funded by the Italian Ministry of Health for the prevention and control of healthcare
 <italic class="italic">-</italic>associated fungal infections (project code: GR-2011-02347606). These isolates were obtained from blood samples of patients with acquired brain injuries. Initially, all strains were presumptively identified using 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> medium (Becton Dickinson, Italy) and Vitek 2 yeast identification system (bioMérieux, Italy) following manufacturer’s recommendations. The identity of the yeast isolates was subsequently confirmed by using simple and rapid species-specific PCR-based methods according to previous studies [
