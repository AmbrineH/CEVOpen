<p id="Par22" class="p">Size distribution and average diameter of emulsionsâ€™ droplets were determined by dynamic light scattering on a Malvern 4700 submicron analyzer (Malvern Instruments Inc., Worcestershire, U.K.). Distilled water was used as dispersant to avoid effects of multiple scattering, dispersion, and interactions between droplets. The cumulative mean diameter (z-average) and polydispersity index (PdI) were used to describe droplet average size and size distribution, respectively.</p>
