<p id="Par16" class="p">For the susceptibility studies, the EO from pistachio hull was dissolved in DMSO at the concentration of 10 mg/ml. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of pistachio hull EO and the antifungal compounds voriconazole, fluconazole and caspofungin (Sigma Aldrich, Italy) against the strains reported above were determined following the CLSI guidelines (M27-A3 2008, [

 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> (voriconazole), 64 and 0.0625 μg ml
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> (fluconazole), 2 and 0.00195 μg ml
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> (caspofungin) and 10 and 0.0049% mg/ml (pistachio hull essential oil). MFC (minimal fungicidal concentration) for the pistachio hull EO was determined transferring each clear sample (20 μL) on agar plate incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The MFC was defined as the lowest extract concentration that killed 99.9% of the final inocula after 24-48 h incubation.
