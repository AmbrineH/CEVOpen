<p id="Par17" class="p">In the combination assays, the ‘checkerboard’ procedure was followed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] in order to test the efficacy of the combination EO/antifungal compounds against all tested strains. This method allows varying the concentrations of each antimicrobial along the different axes, thus ensuring that each well contained a different combination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. MIC data for pistachio hull EO and each antifungal compound were converted into fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC), defined as the ratio of the concentration of the antimicrobial in an inhibitory concentration with a second compound to the concentration of the antimicrobial by itself.
