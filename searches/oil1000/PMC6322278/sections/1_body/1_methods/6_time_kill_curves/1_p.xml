<p id="Par21" class="p">Tubes containing each antifungal compound at concentrations corresponding to 1, 1/2 and 1/4 x MIC were inoculated with a suspension of 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> strain 9,

 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/ml and then incubated at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. A growth control was also performed. Samples for viable counting were withdrawn at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h and, if necessary, diluted in fresh medium. At least four dilutions of each sample were spread on agar plates (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar), incubated at 30 °C and counted after 48 h.
