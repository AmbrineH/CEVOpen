<p id="Par31" class="p">It is known that plant natural products mostly exert their antifungal effects by membrane-active mechanism and synergistic effects can be found between different classes of plant products as well as between natural products and azoles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. Bioactive compounds present in natural products, such as EOs, may interact to produce synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects. Synergistic interactions could result in increased efficacy, or reduce effective doses, therefore reducing the likelihood of adverse effects [
