<p id="Par26" class="p">Concentration-dependent killing was observed with pistachio hull EO against all tested strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> a-c). A good fungicidal effect was achieved after 2 h exposure against 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> strain 26 at the concentration of 1 x MIC, whereas the same effect was achieved against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain 16 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> strain 9 after 8 h exposure. Concentrations of ½ MIC and ¼ MIC exerted a fungistatic effect against all tested strains. As reported in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain 16 was the most resistant.
