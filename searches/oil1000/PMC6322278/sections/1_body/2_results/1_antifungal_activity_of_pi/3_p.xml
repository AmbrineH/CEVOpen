 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> reports the MIC data for the pure compounds present in pistachio hull EO and the mix of the most representative compounds in the proportion found in the oil. Amongst the pure molecules, 3-carene was the most effective against the three representative tested strains, followed by D-limonene. No activity was detected with α-pinene, α-terpineol and camphene. Interestingly, the mix of compounds was effective against all tested strains, indicating a possible synergistic interaction amongst the individual compounds. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strain 16 was the most resistant, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> strain 9 and
