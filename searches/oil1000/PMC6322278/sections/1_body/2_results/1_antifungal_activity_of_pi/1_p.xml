<p id="Par23" class="p">MICs and MFCs values for pistachio hull EO and three antifungal compounds were determined (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Results of negative controls using DMSO as a solvent at the concentration of 1% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/v) indicated the complete absence of inhibition of all the strains tested (data not shown). Pistachio hull EO was active against all strains tested, 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> strains being the most sensitive (complete inhibition achieved with a concentration of 1.25–2.50 mg/ml), followed by 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> strains (complete inhibition achieved with a concentration of 1.25–5.0 mg/ml) and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> strains (complete inhibition achieved with a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml). The effect of pistachio hull EO was fungicidal against all tested strains. Interestingly, all clinical strains of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and1 strain of 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> (strain 33) were resistant to both voriconazole and fluconazole.
