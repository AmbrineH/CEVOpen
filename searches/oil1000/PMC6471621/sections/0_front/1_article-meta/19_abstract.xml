 <p class="p">Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), known as sleeping sickness and caused by 
  <italic class="italic">Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, is threatening low-income populations in sub-Saharan African countries with 61 million people at risk of infection. In order to discover new natural products against HAT, thirty-seven Vietnamese essential oils (EOs) were screened for their activity in vitro on 
  <italic class="italic">Trypanosoma brucei brucei</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">Tbb</italic>) and cytotoxicity on mammalian cells (WI38, J774). Based on the selectivity indices (SIs), the more active and selective EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography. The anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity of some major compounds (isolated or commercial) were also determined. Our results showed for the first time the selective anti-trypanosomal effect of four EOs, extracted from three Zingiberaceae species (
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma zedoaria</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic>) and one Lauraceae species (
  <italic class="italic">Litsea cubeba</italic>) with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 3.17 ± 0.72, 2.51 ± 1.08, 3.10 ± 0.08, and 2.67 ± 1.12 nL/mL respectively and SI &gt; 10. Identified compounds accounted for more than 85% for each of them. Among the five major components of 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> EO, curlone is the most promising anti-trypanosomal candidate with an IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 1.38 ± 0.45 µg/mL and SIs of 31.7 and 18.2 compared to WI38 and J774 respectively.
