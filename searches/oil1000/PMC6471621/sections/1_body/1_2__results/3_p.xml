<p class="p">The chemical composition of these four interesting EOs was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with mass spectrometry (MS) and flame ionization detector (FID) in order to control their quality but also to identify some active compounds. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01158-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, more than 85% of each EO composition was characterized. Monoterpenes such as citronellal (43.10%), isopulegol (11.10%), limonene (8.72%), pulegol (6.52%), linalool (5.60%), and citronellol (5.17%) were major components of 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> EO while EOs of the three Zingiberaceae species contained mainly sesquiterpenes. Interestingly, α-zingiberene, β-bisabolene, β-sesquiphellandrene, and 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-curcumene were identified in both EOs extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic> with relative percentages respectively of 25.38, 3.38, 18.27, and 5.22% (
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>) and 27.71, 7.27, 8.08, and 2.71% (
 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic>). The difference in the composition of these two EOs is that oxygenated sesquiterpenes (i.e., α-turmerone (10.28%), germacrone (3.34%), curlone (5.15%), and 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone (9.93%)) were found in 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> EO while monoterpenes including β-phellandrene (14.78%) and camphene (6.94%) were found in 
 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic> EO. 8,9-Dehydro-9-formyl cycloisolongifolene (29.31%), curdione (13.52%), and germacrone (8.95%) were shown as major components of the EO extracted from another curcuma species, 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic>.
