<p class="p">These isolated compounds along with two commercially available ones, α-zingiberene and 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone (chemical structures in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01158-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), were analyzed for anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01158-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Curlone with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 1.38 µg/mL (6.32 µM) against 
 <italic class="italic">Tbb</italic> bloodstream form and SI &gt; 10 compared to cytotoxicity on mammalian cells could explain a part of the observed activity of the EO (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 3.17 nL/mL). This compound may be considered as a promising model for the development of a new treatment of HAT.
