<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> EO was chosen for further investigations because it was easy to obtain in a high amount as being present in the marc after turmeric starch extraction. The first fractionation using column chromatography with silica gel and gradients of eluents (n-hexane-ethyl acetate) allowed to obtain two important groups, CF1 with sesquiterpenes and CF5 with oxygenated sesquiterpenes. After the second column chromatography using silver nitrate impregnated silica gel of both fractions, three compounds, Î²-sesquiphellandrene, 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-curcumene, and curlone with a purity respectively of 96.9, 97.4, and 91.7%, were purified.
