<p class="p">Concerning the mechanism of action of curlone, which is not commercially available, there are no data in the literature. Three other related sesquiterpenoids, α-zingiberene, β-sesquiphellandrene, and 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone, showed apoptotic effects on different human cancer cells which was associated with the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and the activation of capase-3 at concentrations of 120 and 160 µg/mL (α-zingiberene), 5.10 µg/mL (β-sesquiphellandrene), and 40, 80, and 120 µg/mL (
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone) [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The structure of curlone shows the presence of both an exocyclic ethylene group as in β-sesquiphellandrene and a ketone group as in 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone. This suggests that these two groups may play an important role in anti-trypanosomal activity of the compound.
