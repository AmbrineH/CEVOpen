<p class="p">In the literature, monoterpenes were already shown to be the major compounds of EOs extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic>, although the identified components were different. Indeed, EOs extracted from fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> collected in China and Taiwan contained mostly citral (neral and geranial) from 57% to 81% [

 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> was dominated by six major compounds, citronellal (43.10%), isopulegol (11.10%), limonene (8.72%), pulegol (6.52%), linalool (5.60%), and citronellol (5.17%). This profile is in agreement with the one extracted from

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Four of these six compounds, citronellal, limonene, linalool, and citronellol, are already known for their anti-trypanosomal activity (IC

 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> EO (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 2.67 ± 1.12 nL/mL). Nevertheless, the activity of this EO may also partially be due to other compounds or a synergy between these components. It is worth noting that these compounds did not show any cytotoxicity at the highest tested concentration (50 µg/mL for citronellal and citronellol and 100 µg/mL for limonene and linalool) against different mammalian cell lines: CHO, WI38, Balb/3T3 fibroblast, and J774 in those studies [
