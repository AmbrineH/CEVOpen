<p class="p">Identified compounds of Vietnamese 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> EO were in agreement with the reported chemical profile of samples collected from other countries (e.g. Malaysia, China, India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Brazil, Nigeria, Cameroon, and France) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. It contains mainly sesquiterpenes: α-zingiberene—25.38%, β-sesquiphellandrene—18.27%, α-turmerone—10.28%, 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone—9.93%, 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-curcumene—5.22%, curlone—5.15%, β-bisabolene—3.38%, and germacrone—3.34%. Regarding the anti-trypanosomal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, previous reports only focused on curcumin and other curcuminoids with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> around 5 μM for curcumin [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], 9.84 ± 0.84 μM for bisdemethoxycurcumin, and 7.19 ± 1.02 μM for demethoxycurcumin [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. We report here for the first time the interesting effect of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> EO against 
 <italic class="italic">Tbb</italic> bloodstream form (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 3.17 ± 0.72 nL/mL) with a good selectivity (SI &gt; 10). Thanks to the purification process, β-sesquiphellandrene, 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-curcumene, and curlone could be isolated and tested for anti-trypanosomal activity together with two commercially available compounds, α-zingiberene and 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-turmerone. Among them, curlone revealed the most interesting effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Tbb</italic> bloodstream form with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 1.38 ± 0.45 µg/mL (6.32 ± 2.38 µM) and SI of 31.7 and 18.2 compared to cytotoxicity on two mammalian cell lines, WI38 and J774, respectively. This result showed the potential of curlone in the research for new anti-trypanosomal molecules. α-Zingiberene, β-sesquiphellandrene, and 
 <italic class="italic">ar</italic>-curcumene showed a moderate effect with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 6.91 ± 2.60, 9.89 ± 1.18, and 13.38 ± 2.46 µg/mL respectively. However their activity along with curlone can explain a part of the observed activity for the 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> EO.
