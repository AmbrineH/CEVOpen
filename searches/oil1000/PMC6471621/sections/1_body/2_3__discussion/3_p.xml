<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic> EO composition including 8,9-dehydro-9-formyl cycloisolongifolene (29.31%), curdione (13.52%), and germacrone (8.95%) differed from both other EOs but also from previous articles. These publications reported the presence in higher amounts of either monoterpenes such as eucalyptol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, α-phellandrene, and camphor or other sesquiterpenes such as curzerene, epicurzerene, curdione, curzerenone, and germacrone, depending on the analyzed samples [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. This variability can be related to the different geographic origins but also to different chemotypes. Germacrone, one of the major compounds identified in our EO, did not show any effect on 
 <italic class="italic">Tbb</italic> bloodstream form in the study of Petrelli et al. (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 100 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], meaning that other components should be responsible for the observed activity of the Vietnamese 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic> EO (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 2.51 ± 1.08 nL/mL). Knowing that this EO activity is moderately selective compared to the cytotoxicity on two mammalian cell lines, and that the plant is not difficult to cultivate, 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic> EO and its components should be further studied.
