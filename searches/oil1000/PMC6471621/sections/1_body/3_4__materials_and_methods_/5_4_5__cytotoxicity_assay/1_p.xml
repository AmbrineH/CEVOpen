<p class="p">The cytotoxicity assays were performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] with concentrations ranging from 50 to 1.40 nL/mL (dilution of 1.67). The selectivity index (SI) values were calculated using the formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">SI = IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> on mammalian cells/IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> on protozoan parasites
