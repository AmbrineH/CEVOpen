 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> EO obtained by hydro-distillation was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh) using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (EtOAc) gradients as the eluent to yield six fractions (CF1-CF6). CF1 and CF5 were further separated to obtain three compounds by column chromatography using AgNO
