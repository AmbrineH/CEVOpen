<p class="p">The assay was performed in 96-well plates as previously described [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The primary screening was repeated two times in triplicate at the concentrations of 50 nL/mL and 25 nL/mL (for 33 EOs) or 10 nL/mL and 5 nL/mL (for 4 EOs). Fifty µL of parasite culture (5 x 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> parasites/mL) was added with 50 µL of diluted EOs in each well. Ten µL of alamar blue (diluted with PBS at the ratio 1:1) was added to each well after 72 h of incubation and the plates were further incubated for 4 h. The fluorescence of the reduced reagent was measured on a spectrophotometer at 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths. Suramin was used as positive control. The EOs that inhibited more than 50% of the parasite growth at 25 or 10 nL/mL were analyzed for IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> determination. Samples were tested in eight serial three-fold dilutions ranging from 50–0.02 nL/mL, except 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> EO, 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma zedoaria</italic> EO, and 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber zerumbet</italic> EO (ranging from 10–0.005 nL/mL) and 
 <italic class="italic">Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> EO (ranging from 5–0.002 nL/mL) in duplicate. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were calculated from dose response growth inhibition curves using Microsoft Excel files and mean IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were obtained from at least three repetitions.
