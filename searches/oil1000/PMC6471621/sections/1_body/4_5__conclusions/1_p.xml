<p class="p">Our results highlighted for the first time the interesting anti-trypanosomal activity of four EOs extracted from Vietnamese plants, 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic>. Monoterpenes were major components of 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> EOs, while the three other EOs contained mostly sesquiterpenes. Among the five major compounds of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> EO, curlone was the most active and selective compound. This compound can explain a part of the observed activity of the EO. Its activity should be further investigated in the research for new anti-trypanosomal compounds.
