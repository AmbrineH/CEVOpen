<p class="p">Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is caused by two subspecies of the parasite 
 <italic class="italic">Trypanosoma brucei, T. brucei gambiense</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">rhodesiense,</italic> while another subspecies, 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei brucei</italic> affects non-human vertebrates [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei gambiense</italic> causes the chronic form in West and Central Africa while 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei rhodesiense</italic> causes the acute form in Eastern and Southern Africa. Although many efforts were made this past decade to decrease HAT incidence, this fatal disease is still endemic in 36 African countries [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Remote rural areas are the most affected partly because of high poverty, higher risk of infection from the livestock reservoir (by the tsetse fly, responsible for parasite transmission, mainly living in rural areas), and lack of health care accessibility and infrastructures for current drugs administration [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Furthermore, it was reported recently that trypanosomes also have an extravascular localization [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] which makes it difficult to eliminate the disease. Moreover, available drugs for the treatment of HAT: pentamidine, suramine, melarsoprol, eflornithine, and nifurtimox, have shown not only a lot of serious side effects and limited efficacy but also the increase of drug resistance [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The newest product, fexinidazole, which was recommended by the European Medicines Agency in November 2018 as the first oral treatment for HAT, is however only active against infections caused by 
 <italic class="italic">T. brucei gambiense</italic> [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. So, research for alternative strategies is still needed.
