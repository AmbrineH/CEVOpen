<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) along with other secondary metabolites extracted from plants have been used all over the world for various biological and pharmacological activities, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-mutagenic, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidant [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], which is essential to treat the neurological phase of the disease. This crossing of the blood–brain barrier constitutes a major limitation for pentamidine and suramin efficacy [

Indeed, a review from 2013 until April 2017 showed that 56 EOs were tested for anti-trypanosomal activity with 9 strongly and 20 moderately effective EOs [
