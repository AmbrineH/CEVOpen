 <sup class="sup">3</sup>), hematocrit (Hct; %), and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration (g/L). The RBC count was obtained with a Thoma hemocytometer using Dacie’s diluting fluid. A capillary Hct tube was used to determine the Hct value. The Hb concentration was measured by spectrophotometry (540 nm) via the cyanmethemoglobin method. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), and mean corpuscular Hb concentrations (MCHC) were calculated with the following formulae (
