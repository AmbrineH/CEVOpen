<p class="p">A pathogenic pathogen 
 <italic class="italic">Y. ruckeri</italic> (E42 Accession No: KX388238) was used. A stock of bacteria stored in tryptic soy broth containing 15% glycerol was prepared and maintained at -80°C. Briefly, 2 days before the challenge an aliquot of the bacteria was grown in tryptic soy broth medium at 22°C in a shaker incubator. After 1 day, the bacterial suspension was serially diluted in sterile PBS until the stock bacteria contained ∼10
