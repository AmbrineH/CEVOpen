 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>], applies to a wide range of traits and also to dietary caused intraspecific variation of multiple traits (= phenotypic plasticity) in a model system excluding genotypic variation. Thus, there seems not only to be a nutritional optimum for a traits’ mean, but also its variation, which further strengthens the balanced diet hypothesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Highly imbalanced food results in lower trait means and higher trait variability (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), potentially caused by more/stronger trade-offs across resources arising from physiological stress. Additionally, some traits seem to have higher inherent variation than others, irrespective of “trait type”. Based on our empirical evidence we propose the following hypotheses, leading to further experimental evaluation; i) the mean trait variation calculated based on all trait variation within a resource could be used as an indicator for the food quality and ii) given that there is a direct link of both mean and variation of traits (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), the latter might also be indicative for trade-offs an animal faces when feeding on imbalanced diets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Finally, using a single parthenogenetic lineage excludes genotypic plasticity and creates a phenotypically tractable model species. This is a first step to establish an experimental platform to ultimately disentangle how variation (or the capacity to express plasticity) affects the fitness of individuals [
