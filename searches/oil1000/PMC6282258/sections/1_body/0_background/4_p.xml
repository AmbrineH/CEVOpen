 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] about the effect of diet mixing, we expect similar patterns for the semi-natural single diets; mites which fed on resources with a balanced C/N-ratio (defined as a ratio equal or close to the mites’ stoichiometrical demands) should express a higher average and a lower variance across multiple traits. As no intake target (i.e. species specific optimal elemental/nutritional composition of food) is known for any mite species or soil decomposer it is not possible to predict an optimal C/N intake ratio. However, even the effects of single diets on our phenotypically tractable model species should be strong, as the clonal reproduction eliminates genotypic variation. Hence, we also expect to find a direct negative relationship of the expressed means and variances of traits across resources, which would further support the balanced diet hypothesis [
