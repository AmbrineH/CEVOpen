<p id="Par4" class="p">The theory of phenotypic plasticity predicts that virtually all biological systems inherently include variation of characters at all organization levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. This variation can be induced by virtually any external factor, leading to a nearly infinite number of possible phenotypic specificities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Phenotypic plasticity can therefore be defined as the degree of a single genotype to express variation in multiple traits leading to different phenotypes in response to environmental gradients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Trait based approaches are 
 <italic class="italic">en vogue</italic> in all fields of ecology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>], and it has been assumed that trait means of a species can be used to sufficiently characterize communities and affiliated functionality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Natural populations, however, consists of phenotypically diverse individuals, possessing variable traits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Furthermore, trait variability of individuals within populations is essential for evolutionary processes via natural selection, as the latter acts on the individuals’ phenotypes influenced by a given ecological setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. That is why understanding causes and mechanism leading to such trait variation of individuals can give unprecedented resolution to explain evolutionary ecology dynamics underpinning community structure, trait assemblages, and stability (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]).
