 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. While heritable genetic variation of traits cannot clearly be distinguished from environmentally induced trait variation (phenotypic plasticity) in sexual species, clonal systems provide the possibility to quantify reaction norms of traits and their variation (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]). We selected a variety of different individual and demographic life-history, morphological and defensive traits to quantify their response to food with different nutritional quality. We fed ten semi-natural resources, differing in C/N ratios, to the mites (all are descendants from a single mother and share an identical genotype), and measured the mean and variation of traits along this food quality gradient. Thus, we exploit our “phenotypically-tractable” model species (i.e. a model system without genotypic, but only phenotypic variation), to decipher patterns and mechanisms of dietary induced trait plasticity. More specifically we ask how nutritional quality (approximated by C/N ratios) influences the expression of multiple traits regarding i) trait means, ii) trait variation, and iii) differences among traits.
