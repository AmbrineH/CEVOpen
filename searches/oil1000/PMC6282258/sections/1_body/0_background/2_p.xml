<p id="Par5" class="p">Theory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>], but also some experimental evidence (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]) suggest that phenotypic plasticity may arises from trade-offs among multiple traits within a species that are ultimately caused by imbalances in elemental stoichiometry or nutritional components of food. For instance, nutrients influence fitness related traits (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]), but also body shapes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>], or intraspecific chemical communication (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]) of an animal, and may even alter biological rules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. In this context, a resource can be considered optimal if i) it enables an animal to respond with the highest possible trait mean (= balanced diet hypothesis; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]), but also ii) can sustain phenotypes with low trait variability and thus a stable performance (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]). For instance, two recent meta-analyses suggest that mixed-, rather than single-food diets result in significantly higher average fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] and reduce intraspecific variance in fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>], because mixed foods are more likely to represent an optimal, balanced diet close to an animals intake target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Bunning et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] as well as Han &amp; Dingemanse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] tested these hypotheses in the context of reproductive performance and behavioral stability, respectively, and found that optimal dietary choice indeed led to an improved average expression and a reduced variance of their selected traits. Still, reaction norms of only a relatively limited number of traits towards a broad gradient of macronutrients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>] or elements [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] have been tested for a few species and the relationship of means, variation and elemental balance across multiple traits of different types (e.g. adaptive defense, morphological or reproductive traits) has, to our best knowledge, not been investigated in a single species under genotypic control.
