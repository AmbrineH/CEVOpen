<p id="Par10" class="p">At the start of the experiment we selected young (approximately one week after eclosing) adult individuals from their original culture-plates. We directly used 130 specimens per resource (= 1300 in total) for chemical experiments, while 25 specimens per resource (= 250 in total) were individually redistributed into smaller culture boxes (45 × 40 × 35 mm; grounded with the plaster of Paris mixture) for further experiments.</p>
