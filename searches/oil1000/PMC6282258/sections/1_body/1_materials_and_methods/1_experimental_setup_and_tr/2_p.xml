 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The life-history traits were selected to quantify the reproductive fitness of one female based on its offspring [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. All chemical traits were related to defensive exocrine opisthonotal oil-glands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Oil-gland chemistry is assumed to be highly adaptive because it plays an important role in structuring feeding interactions in soil food webs and enables oribatid mites to live in an “enemy-free space” [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], i.e. a conceptual way of living that reduces or eliminate a species’ vulnerability against predators [
