 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), except for damaged individuals that were excluded from the measurements. We overall measured eleven continuous variables of individual specimen (five dorsal and six ventral distances) for the morphometric analysis (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> for details) using a VHX-5000 microscope (Keyence Deutschland GmbH, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) equipped with the VH-Z50L lens. To remove the effect of isometric body size scaling on morphometrical measures we standardized all values of one individual by its notogaster length (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Afterwards, all specimens (mothers) were dried at 60 °C and the individual body mass, expressed as dry weight [μg] was determined as described above.
