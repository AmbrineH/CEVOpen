<p id="Par13" class="p">Individual mites (= mothers, n = 10*25) could lay eggs for ten days and the same food and water was provided ad libitum three times a week (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Every box was checked daily, and we counted the number of eggs, juvenile instars (i.e. larva, protonymph, deutonymph, tritonymph) and adults for a period of up to 12 weeks. We removed freshly hatched adults from the culture plates to ensure no new egg deposition and froze them for further analysis. The total developmental time [days] for each mother’s offspring was calculated as weighted arithmetic mean (developmental time = ∑ [d
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>*p
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>]; where d
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the experiment day and p
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the proportion of new adult specimens on d
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>). Replicates where all offspring died before reaching adulthood were not used to calculate the developmental time (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 72). In addition to the counted data (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) we dried all individuals at 60 °C to determine the total biomass output of individual mothers, expressed as dry weight [mg] per female.
