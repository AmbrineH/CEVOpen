<p id="Par15" class="p">For C/N analyses dried resource powders (5 ± 1 mg) were weighed into tin capsules. Total organic carbon and nitrogen contents were measured by an elemental analyzer (EA 1108 Elemental Analyser, Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). Acetanilide (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as standard. Carbon and nitrogen amounts were calculated based on the standard and the initial dry weight and expressed as C/N ratios (Table
