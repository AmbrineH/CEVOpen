<p id="Par11" class="p">Oil-gland extractions of 30 specimens from each of the resources (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10*30) were accomplished by immersing individuals in 50 μl hexane (GC grade, 98% purity purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 3 min (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The extraction solvent also contained tetradecane (1 ng/μl; ≥99.8%, analytical standard, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) as an internal standard. Crude extracts were used for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses and mite specimens were stored at − 20 °C for further measurements. Samples were analyzed with a QP 2010ultra GC-MS (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) according to a protocol given elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a ZB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, df = 0.25 μm) from Phenomenex (Aschaffenburg, Germany). The extracted mites were dried at 60 °C until weight constancy and the dry weight was determined with a microbalance (Mettler Toledo, XS3DU, 0.1 μg readability and 1 μg repeatability) to calculate the secretion amount per animal/dry weight in [ng/μg], see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Furthermore, we used the chemical data to quantify the relative amounts in [%] of all oil gland compounds based on peak areas. All compounds have been identified previously (for details see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]), and were assigned using their retention indices and diagnostic ions.
