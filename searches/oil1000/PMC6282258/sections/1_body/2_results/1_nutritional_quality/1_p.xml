<p id="Par20" class="p">Some food resources were characterized by an extreme composition – e.g. blood meal had a very high C/N ratio, which corresponds to a high nitrogen content (13.3 ± 0.1% N; mean ± SD), while pollen was nitrogen poor, but comparatively carbon rich (3.6 ± 0.1% N; mean ± SD). Yet, most of the remaining resources had a quite equilibrated stoichiometry (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Thus, the variability of the C/N ratios across the food was high (CV = 47%; 7.5 ± 3.5; mean ± SD), and the spanned from 3.3 (blood meal) to 13.6 (pollen). While we focused our analyses on C/N ratios only, the foods also differed in other nutritional dimensions (i.e. elements and macronutrients; see Additional file
