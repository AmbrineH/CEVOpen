 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Over 100 years ago, Woltereck [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] started to discuss underlying mechanisms, but also noted that it is hardly possible to quantify the range of a species’ variability caused by nutritional quality, because even in pure linages of facultative parthenogenetic species, like 
 <italic class="italic">Daphnia</italic>, a full control of the genotype is not possible. He also suggested that an obligate asexual species would be a perfect model to study nutritional reaction norms of traits and their plasticity. That is why parthenogenetic generalists (like some oribatid mites), which can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions (i.e. possess a general purpose genotype; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]), are the models that Woltereck [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] proposed. Correspondingly, we used the single genotype of a “phenotypically-tractable” model lineage 
 <italic class="italic">A. longisetosus</italic> ran to unravel the relationship of food quality and variation of multiple traits (i.e. phenotypic plasticity).
