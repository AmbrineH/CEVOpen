 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. Besides selection, it is still poorly understood why some traits are more prone to variation than others, i.e. bear higher plasticity. Our data indicates that some traits tend to be more variable than other, but this was not related to certain “trait types” (in our case “chemistry”, “life history” and “morphology”). This different 
 <italic class="italic">variability potential</italic> allows to derive different hypothesis: a certain trait may react with higher variability to an environmental gradient, because it faces more trade-offs along this gradient than other characters; or the formation/development of a trait may be more “complex” and thus demands a stronger segregation of energy leading to more trade-offs. Consequently, lower trait variation may indicate less trade-offs (or selection) along a certain gradient. Also, a lower variability may be a signal for an inherently lower plasticity of a trait because it is less controlled by the phenotypes’ response or selection. For instance, in our experiments, the body size of the mites changed considerably along the C/N gradient, yet the overall body shape (morphometric measurements) only showed a weak response and low variability. This may indicate, that – besides selection or genetical conservation – the overall body size could be influenced by the phenotypic response to altered nutrients. Yet, the proportions of the body shape isometrically scaled with this phenotypic change, leading to low overall variability.
