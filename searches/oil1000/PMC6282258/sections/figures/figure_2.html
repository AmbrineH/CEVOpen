 <p> The effect of the elemental composition of the food (C/N-ratios) on the mean expression value of multiple univariate traits of the ‘phenotypically tractable’ model mite lineage Archegozetes longisetosus ran. Curves are regressions of non-linear models (Table 4). The y-axis denotes the normalized trait value (between 0 and 1) for each trait after normality transformation (see Table 4) and rescaling (min-max normalization; see eq. 1). Amount = secretion amount [ng/μg] of individual mites; regeneration = fraction of regenerating individuals [%]; developmental time = time [days] of one females offspring from egg to adult, calculated as weighted mean; survival = survival rate of one females offspring [%]; offspring = total number of offspring per female [N*female − 1]; output = the reproductive biomass output per female [mg*female − 1] and body mass = body mass [μg] of individual mites raised on the ten resources. Scatter plots for each trait across the resources as well as detailed post-hoc comparisons using Dunn’s test can be found the Additional files  3 and 4, respectively </p>
