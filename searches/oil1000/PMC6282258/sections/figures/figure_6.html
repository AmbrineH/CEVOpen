 <p> The relationship of trait means [normalized trait value t’] to trait variation [ln CV] of the different univariate traits across resources. The grey line denotes the linear regression based on a mixed linear model (intercept, estimate: − 0.36 ± 0.17, t = − 2.1, p = 0.040; slope, estimate: − 1.27 ± 0.38, t = 3.3, p = 0.002).
