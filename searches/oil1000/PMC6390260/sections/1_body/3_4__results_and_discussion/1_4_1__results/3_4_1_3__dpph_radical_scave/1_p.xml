 <italic class="italic">Barringtonia asiatic</italic>a against the DPPH radical scavenging was evaluated as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The extract showed an appreciable DPPH scavenging activity compared to the test control. The scavenge 50% of the radical (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) values of 
 <italic class="italic">Barringtonia asiatica</italic> and that of vitamin C were exhibited to be 13.34
