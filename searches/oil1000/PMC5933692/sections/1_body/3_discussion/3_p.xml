<p class="p">A hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone is also among of the main compounds (5.3%) found in the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rosmarinifolia</italic>. It was recognized as a naphotoquinones belonging to hydroxy-methyl-naphthoquinone since its mass spectrum and its linear retention indices are very similar to those of other known isomers of hydroxyl-methyl-naphthoquinones (e.g. plumbagin, 7-methyl-juglone). It is interesting to note that naphthoquinones are biosynthesized in several plant families (e.g. Plumbaginaceae, Juglandaceae, Boraginaceae, Iridaceae, Verbenaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Gentianaceae, Droseraceae, and Euphorbiaceae, among others) as well as in algae, fungi, some animals and also as products of the metabolism in some bacteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. From an ecological point of view, naphthoquinones act as chemical defense for many plants and several naphthoquinones are essentials in the biosynthesis of many molluscicidal and insecticidal compounds (e.g. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives) [
 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Furthermore, naphthoquinones and their derivatives are compounds with important pharmacological activities such as anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anti-parasitic (e.g. antimalarial and antileishmania) [

 <xref rid="pone.0196947.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Pharmacological activities showed by naphthoquinones and derivatives can be explicated through two mechanisms: (1) as pro-oxidants, reducing oxygen to reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (2) as electrophiles, forming covalent bonds with tissue nucleophiles [
