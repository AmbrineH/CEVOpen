<p class="p">Flavonolignans of silymarin complex extracted from milk thistle could act as chemopreventive or therapeutic adjuvants, having hepatoprotectant, anti-inflammatory activities, as well as being able to protect skin from photoaging. Milk thistle extract clinical use is negatively influenced by its low stability and aqueous solubility which limits oral and topical administration. The loading of MTE into sodium carboxymethyl cellulose microparticles (MTE-mp) by spray drying technique was able to overcome these critical characteristics, enhancing the bioavailability of functional silymarin complex after the intake. The engineering microparticulate form of MTE was used as an active ingredient to functionalize two topical formulations, hydrogel and emulgel. The MTE-mp technological ingredient was more easily incorporated in both formulations than the raw extract. In particular, the loading of emulgel with a high amount of MTE-mp (6% 
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>), did not affect the stability of the polymeric network system, and also obtained a homogeneous distribution of the active ingredients. The optimization of the emulgel with enrichment by lecithin (L-MTE-mp emulgel) as a permeation enhancer reduced the dimensional distribution of oil droplets, making the structure of the internal lipid phase of the emulgel more fluid. The good interaction between lecithin and MTE-mp into the emulgel system facilitated the release of the active ingredients from the formulation, favoring exposure of the extract to the receiving compartment and improving the in vitro skin permeation. These results can represent the basis for future trials to validate the in vivo efficiency of MTE-mp as a functional, easy-handling ingredient to be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of skin damages.
