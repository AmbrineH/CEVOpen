<p class="p">A technological characterization of the MTE-mp-loaded hydrogel and emulgel, with respect to the MTE raw extract, was performed on loaded and blank (without extract) microparticles. The products were characterized in term of stability (centrifuge test), dimensional distribution (by laser light scattering, LLS), and distribution of active ingredient (by fluorescence microscopy, FM). Moreover, the main chemicalâ€“physical characteristics (pH, viscosity) of all produced formulations were analyzed. Given the different natures (hydrogel and emulgel), a specific method was devised to evaluate the MTE-mp permeability from each type of formulation through synthetic membranes by means of Franz Cells. During recent years, some authors [
