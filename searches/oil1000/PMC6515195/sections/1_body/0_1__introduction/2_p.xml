<p class="p">It has been demonstrated that topical administration of silymarin complex provides an efficient way to enrich the endogenous cutaneous protection system, and thus may be a successful strategy for diminishing ultraviolet radiation-mediated oxidative damage in the skin [

Recently, much research has been focused on the potential use of this drug as a free-radical scavenger to prevent oxidative skin damage, and its topical application has been met with considerable interest. Recently, a binary complex composed of MTE and beta-cyclodextrins was used to well functionalize emulsions designed for skin delivery, and to enhance the silymarin permeation rate [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Based on these evidences, the aim of the present research was to develop two functional topical formulations to support MTE-mp potential use as active ingredient in formulation for skin delivery. Milk Thistle extract loaded microparticles were used to enrich two topical formulations: a hydrogel, to evaluate the ability of MTE-mp to be easily enclosed in a monophasic formulation, and an emulgel, in which the oil in water (O/W) emulsion was stabilized with the same gelling agent of the hydrogel as a delivery system. As a result, the emulgel possessed the characteristics of both emulsion and gel, which made it a dual control release system [
