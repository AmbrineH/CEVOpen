<p class="p">The size distribution of the droplets constituting the dispersed phase of the formulations was evaluated by means of liquid module laser scattering diffraction (LS 13 230 Particle Volume Module Plus Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, CA, USA). The samples were prepared by diluting the formulations in deionized water; a few drops of each sample were then introduced into the analysis cell so as to obtain an optimal darkening [

The dimensional distribution of the powders was then processed with a specific software using the Fraunhofer mathematical model. The analyses were carried out in triplicate: the results were expressed as d
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (average diameter) and as span [(d
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>â€“d
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>)/d
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>], a parameter that takes into account the polydispersity of the droplet size distribution in the dispersed phase; the higher the span value, the greater the inhomogeneity of the size distribution.
