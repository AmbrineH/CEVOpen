<p class="p">Morphology of the blank and MTE- and MTE-mp-loaded emulgels was examined by fluorescent microscopy (FM). The samples were spread on a slide and dried under inert nitrogen flow. The dried sample was imaged by FM using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope, with a 2.5 and 20x ± 1.4 NA plan apochromat oil immersion objectives (Carl Zeiss Vision, München–Hallbergmoos, Germany) using standard DAPI (40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) optics that adsorb violet radiation (max. 372 nm) and emit a blue fluorescence (max. 456 nm).</p>
