<p class="p">Preliminary experiments indicated that the use of water was adequate to evaluate the permeation profiles of the tested extract only from the hydrogel formulation, but not from the emulgel. In the latter case, the components of the oil phase (silicones, butters, and consistency factors) partially permeated together with the extract, causing problems both with occlusion of the membrane pores and in the column during the subsequent quantitative analysis by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector RPHPLCâ€“DAD. For this reason, in a second set of experiments, a different receiving compartment was selected that was adequate to analyze both formulations in parallel. In particular, literature data [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] indicate that appropriate amounts of organic solvent in the receiving compartment can facilitate the analysis of samples containing fat and/or water-soluble phases; therefore, different hydro alcoholic solutions (water/ethanol in different ratios) were tested for the evaluation of the in vitro permeation of the systems under examination. The study of the methods reported in the literature, as well as the assessment of the adaptability of these methods to the formulations and extracts under examination and to the chromatographic technique for the quantification of the sample, allowed us to select a hydro-alcoholic solution composed of ethanol (EtOH):water ratio of 70:30 as a receiving compartment.
