 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] with slight modifications. The release/permeation behavior of MTE from the formulation was measured in Franz-type vertical diffusion cells (Hanson research corporation, HansonResearchCorporation, Chatsworth, CA, USA) with permeation areas of 1.7671 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, applying a SKIN STRAT–TM
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> membrane between the donor and receiving compartment, and assuring the absence of air bubbles. Strat-M membrane is suitable for transdermal diffusion testing; it is a synthetic, non-animal based model for transdermal diffusion testing that is predictive of diffusion in human skin, and is designed for screening of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), cosmetic actives, formulations, personal care products, pesticides, and chemicals. Each cell was filled with 7 mL of previously degassed receptor fluid (EtOH:water, 70:30) and heated by a thermostatic re-circulating water bath at 37 °C. During the experiments (up to 3 h), the receptor fluid was continuously stirred (170 rpm) by magnetic stirring. Prior to the application of the test sample, the system was stabilized for 15 min. In order to increase the volume of the donor compartment, three dosage wafers (each of 15 mm diameter and 1 mm height) were stacked together. Thus, 1 g of MTE or MTE-mp-loaded formulation was uniformly applied on the membrane surface and subsequently sealed with spring clips and laboratory Parafilm. At appropriate time intervals, aliquots of the receptor fluid (200 µL) were taken and immediately replaced by the fresh receptor mixture. The samples were filtered and directly analyzed by HPLC–DAD for the determination of silybin used as a marker of MTE, as above reported. The amount of MTE permeated per area (Q) for each time interval was calculated by means of the following equation:
