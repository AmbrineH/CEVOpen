<p class="p">For the quantitative determination of the main active silybin, it was necessary to first determine the calibration curve of silybin in the solvent ratio of EtOH:water 70:30. 
 <italic class="italic">Linearity.</italic> Silybin reference standard solutions were prepared at three concentration levels (100–400 µg/mL) and injected three times. The standard curve was analyzed using the linear least-squares regression equation derived from the peak area (regression equation 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> = 2915.3
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> − 63.725, 
 <italic class="italic">r
  <sup class="sup">2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.9998, where 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> is the peak area and 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> the concentration). Silybin content was evaluated by an HPLC apparatus (Agilent 1100 series system equipped with a Model G-1312 pump, a Rheodyne Model G-1322A loop (20 μL), a DAD G-1315 detector, and a 150 × 3.9 mm i.d. C-18 μ-Bondapack column). Peak areas were calculated with an Agilent integrator. The solvents were HCOOH 0.1% in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (solvent A) and HCOOH 0.1% in MeOH (solvent B). Elution gradient: 0 → 5 min, 43 → 45% B; 5 → 10 min, 45% B; 10 → 115 min, 45 → 50% B. Analysis was carried out in triplicate: flow rate of 0.8 mL/min; DAD detector set at 288 nm. 
 <italic class="italic">Specificity.</italic> Peak associated with the marker was identified by its retention time (t
 <sub class="sub">r</sub> = 26.12 min) and confirmed by co-injection with a standard.
