<p class="p">The emulgel was an O/W emulsion stabilized with the same gelling agent as the hydrogel. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01547-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> reports each component of the emulgel formulation. The oil phase (cetearyl alcohol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, dimethicone, steareth-21, steareth-2, polypropylene glycol -15 stearyl ether, butylated hydroxytoluene, Butyrospermum parkii, and lecithin), was heated all together at 65 °C; except for glyceryl laurate was added once the final temperature was reached. The aqueous phase (methylpropanediol, caprylyl glycol, phenylpropanol, aqua, and acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer) was separately heated at 65 °C. The oil phase was added to the aqueous one under mechanical agitation by Silverson model SL2T (CRAMI Group srl, Milano, Italy), at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The obtained emulgels were manually stirred until 35 °C. The raw MTE extract and MTE microparticulate (MTE-mp) were slowly introduced, at room temperature, into the emulgels. Finally, arginine was added up to pH 5.55. A formulation without the active ingredient (blank emulgel) was prepared with the same procedure and used as the control.
