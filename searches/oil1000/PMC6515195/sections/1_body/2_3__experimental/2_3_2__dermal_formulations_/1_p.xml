<p class="p">The unloaded formulations were coded as blank, and with lecithin as L-blank. The loaded formulations with raw MTE extract were coded as MTE, and the loaded formulations with MTE microparticles were coded as MTE-mp and L-MTE-mp. All the formulations were compared with each other in terms of stability and their primary chemicalâ€“physical characteristics (pH, viscosity).</p>
