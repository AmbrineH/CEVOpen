<p class="p">The composition of hydrogels (blank, MTE, and MTE-mp) are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01547-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The hydrogels were prepared by heating the water to 65 Â°C, then adding the acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer and weighing separately. The polymer was hydrated for 15 min at room temperature, then methylpropanediol, caprylyl glycol and phenylpropanol were added. The raw extract (MTE) and MTE microparticles (MTE-mp) were separately added at room temperature, under stirring (2 min for the MTE-mp and 10 min for the raw MTE extract). Finally, arginine was added up to pH 5.5, stirring until the hydrogel was formed.
