<p class="p">The viscosity measurement was carried out with a Visco Basic Plus viscometer (FungiLab S.A., Barcelona, Spain) at 25 Â°C, using a Spindle L4 at 12 rpm (for hydrogel) and L4 at 3 rpm (for emulgel). Each reading was done for 10 and 20 s, respectively, after the rotation speed started. The results were expressed as centipoise (cP).</p>
