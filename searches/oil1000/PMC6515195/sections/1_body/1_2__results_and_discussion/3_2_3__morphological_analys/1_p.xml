<p class="p">The characterization by microscopic techniques is essential to obtain reliable data about the actual morphology of the system. In a previous work, an original morphological analysis was conducted by fluorescence microscopy (FM) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] to verify the distribution of an active extract into an O/W emulsion system. The same method has been applied here to evaluate differences in the homogeneity of MTE or MTE-mp distribution into the emulgel system [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The blank formulation resulted well-structured, showing a homogeneous distribution of spherical oil droplets in the aqueous phase. This was analyzed by imaging the superficial area (
