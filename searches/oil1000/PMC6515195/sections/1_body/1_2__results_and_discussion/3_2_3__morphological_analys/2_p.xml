<p class="p">There were critical differences between the MTE- and MTE-mp-loaded emulgels. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01547-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c shows the MTE-mp emulgel with the same structure as the blank emulgel, with augmented fluorescence and a well-dispersed presence of the extract within the aqueous phase and around the oil droplets. Moreover, the presence of the MTE-mp ingredient did not affect the integrity of the internal polymeric network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01547-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d). The homogeneity in the distribution was probably due to the microparticulate form of the technological ingredient, which appropriately interacted with the emulgel components. Otherwise, the raw MTE emulgel showed an incomplete interaction between the active ingredient MTE and the emulsion system. The MTE extract was partially visible, as crystals not incorporated in the droplet phase also negatively affected the superficial and internal properties of the emulgel system (
