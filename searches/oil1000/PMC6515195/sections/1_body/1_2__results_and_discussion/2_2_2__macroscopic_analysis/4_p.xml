<p class="p">The pH value of dermal formulations must be compatible with the skin at the application (pH range 4.0â€“6.0). A product with a high-alkaline pH could favor the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, while a high-acid pH could destroy the bacterial flora that physiologically protects the skin surface. The importance of an adequate regulation of pH also lies with effectiveness of preservatives in a narrow range of acid values, while they lose activity at alkaline values favoring the microbiological instability of formulation [
