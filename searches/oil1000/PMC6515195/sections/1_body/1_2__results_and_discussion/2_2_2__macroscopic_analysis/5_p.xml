<p class="p">Viscosity plays an important role in controlling drug permeation, and was an important parameter for evaluating the physical stability of the formulation. Hydrogel showed higher values of viscosity than emulgel (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01547-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>); the higher viscosity values detected for the MTE-mp-loaded formulations compared with the other ones was probably due to the presence of the functional ingredient sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) in the MTE-mp, as it contributed to the increase in the viscosity of the system.
