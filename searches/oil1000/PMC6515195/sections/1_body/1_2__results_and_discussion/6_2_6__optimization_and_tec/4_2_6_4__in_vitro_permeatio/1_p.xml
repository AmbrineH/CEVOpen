<p class="p">The results of the MTE-mp permeation in vitro experiments using the emulgels with and without L are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01547-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, and expressed as the amount of permeate extract/permeation area as a function of the time elapsed. As reported in commercial product data sheet, the synthetic membrane used, Strat-M, is declared to exhibit differential permeability in the presence of enhancers and to be compatible with common formulation formats, making it appropriate for use during formulation optimization.
