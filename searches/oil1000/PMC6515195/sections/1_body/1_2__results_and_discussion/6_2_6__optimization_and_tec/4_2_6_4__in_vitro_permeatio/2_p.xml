<p class="p">As is evident from the results reported in the graph, the permeation of MTE-mp improved further using the emulgel with L. This behavior could be due to the interaction that L, with its flexible and phospholipid-like structure, has with the lipid ingredients of the emulgel, which normally tend to retain the extract in formulation. The presence of L probably facilitates the release of the extract, making the structure of the internal lipid phase of the emulsion more fluid, and favoring the exposure of the extract to the receiving compartment [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Since it is a passage through a synthetic and non-biological membrane, it is not possible to evaluate the effect that L would have as a membrane-perturbing agent.
