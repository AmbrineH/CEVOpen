<p class="p">Dimensional analysis (by LLS) was conducted to evaluate the distribution of oil droplets into the internal phase of the emulgel, and the effects of the active ingredients MTE and MTE-mp on the dimensional distribution of the emulgel system. The unloaded (blank) emulgel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01547-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a) had a homogeneous dimensional distribution with an average diameter (d
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of dispersed phase droplets of 2.488 µm (span value 1.14). It was evaluated that loading the emulgel with raw MTE influences the size distribution of the dispersed phase. Graphically, a bimodal trend of the distribution curve was visible (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01547-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b), which was caused by the presence of two different dimensional populations. This result can be attributed to the coexistence of the dispersed phase droplets not being adequately incorporated in the formulation with the extract. The average diameter of droplets was in the micrometric range (d
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 6.045 µm), but the span value, due to the bimodal behavior, was very high, confirming the inhomogeneity of the formulation (span value 11.45; d
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> 39.55 µm) [

 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic> did not particularly influence the size distribution of the emulgel, which had a slightly larger dispersed phase (d
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 3.281 µm) than the unloaded one but with a practically unimodal size distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01547-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c). This result could be due to the different solid states of both materials. As previously reported, raw MTE extract showed a crystalline solid state with a dimensional distribution of about 20 µm with respect to the MTE-mp, which had a particulate powder form in an amorphous solid state with a smaller size distribution of about 4 µm [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. As a matter of fact, the microencapsulated extract MTE-mp was suitable to be adequately incorporated in the formulation.
