<p class="p">Skin damage is often treated topically with active ingredients dissolved in gel or emulgel vehicles. Permeation of active ingredients through the epidermis is a prerequisite for an effective topical formulation. A synthetic, non-animal-based model of an artificial membrane, predictive of diffusion in human skin and able to mime in vitro the physiological cutaneous barrier, was used for transdermal diffusion testing to study the rate of MTE release from the produced formulations (hydrogel and emulgel). The aim of this part of the work was to evaluate a potential dual behavior regarding the permeation rate of MTE due to the different formulations, membranes, used mediums, and active ingredient form (MTE raw material or MTE microparticles).</p>
