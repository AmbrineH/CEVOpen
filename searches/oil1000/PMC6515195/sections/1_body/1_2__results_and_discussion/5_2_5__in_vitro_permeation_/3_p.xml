<p class="p">The permeation profiles show that MTE (green and pink lines) permeated in a lower quantity than MTE-mp (lines with square and rhombus), and that the time release of MTE from the hydrogel (green line) was inconstant and non-linear. On the contrary, the microencapsulated MTE-mp permeated in greater quantity and in a constant manner over time. The observed behavior can be explained both on the basis of the different water dissolution rates and permeation properties of the MTE raw material and MTE-mp technological ingredient when applied as pure products [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], and non-homogeneous dispersion into the hydrogel, had a lower permeation rate and a non-constant release profile from the formulation; MTE-mp, which is a technologically improved ingredient, had a higher dissolution rate and greater permeation [
