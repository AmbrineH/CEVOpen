The choice to select two different formulations was done in order to verify how their composition and physical characteristics are able to influence the administration of the active ingredients studied. During the gel manufacturing, the MTE-mp ingredient was more-easily incorporated into the aqueous system than the raw MTE, obtaining a homogeneous distribution of the active ingredient with less mechanical agitation. An emulsion that is more complex in numbers and types of ingredients, with a more complex production process, is nonetheless preferred for cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations for the simultaneous incorporation and delivery of hydrophilic and lipophilic active ingredients to the skin. Moreover, the biphasic system (oil, water) is more appealing to the application, and able to mask the disagreeable taste and odor of some ingredients [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Thus, the raw MTE and MTE-mp were separately added to an oil-in-water (O/W) cosmetic emulgel. A very difficult and incomplete incorporation was obtained for the MTE emulgel, probably due to the crystalline solid state and low solubility of the raw material. Otherwise, MTE-mp, due to the microparticulate amorphous solid state, was easily incorporated into the emulgel up to 6%

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01547" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and thus it is necessary to verify the adequacy of the MTE- and MTE-mp-loaded emulgel, as well as to compare the influence of each active ingredient on the formulation properties.
