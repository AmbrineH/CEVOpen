 <p class="p">In this study, we investigated the potential of two non-edible oil extracts from seeds of 
  <italic class="italic">Colliguaja integerrima</italic> (CIO) and 
  <italic class="italic">Colliguaja salicifolia</italic> (CSO) to use as a renewable source for polyols and, eventually, polyurethane foams or biodiesel. For this purpose, two novel polyols from the aforementioned oils were obtained in a one-single step reaction using a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. The polyol derivatives obtained from the two studied oils were characterized by spectral (FTIR, 
  <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, and 
  <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR), physicochemical (e.g., chromatographic analysis, acid value, oxidizability values, iodine value, peroxide value, saponification number, kinematic viscosity, density, theorical molecular weight, hydroxyl number, and hydroxyl functionality) and thermal (TGA) analyses according to standard methods. Physicochemical results revealed that all parameters, with the exception of the iodine value, were higher for bio-polyols (CSP and CIP) compared to the starting oils. The NMR, TGA, and FTIR analyses demonstrated the formation of polyols. Finally, the OH functionality values for CIP and CSP were 4.50 and 5.00, respectively. This result indicated the possible used of CIP and CSP as a raw material for the preparation of polyurethane rigid foams.
