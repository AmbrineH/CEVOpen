<p class="p">Two novel polyols were successfully synthesized from two non-edible vegetable oils, 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. salicifolia</italic>, by in situ epoxidation and hydroxylation of oils in a one single step. The physicochemical and spectroscopic analysis, presented above, successfully characterized the reactions of polyol formation. Specifically, the FTIR, TGA, and NMR spectroscopic results confirmed complete disappearance of the signature of the double bonds present in the vegetable oils, and the incorporation of hydroxyl groups to form their respective polyols. In addition, the iodine value, acid value, hydroxyl number, hydroxyl functionality, density, and viscosity of the synthesized polyols were also successfully determined. All these values were higher for CIP and CSP when compared to starting oils, with the exception of the iodine value, which decreased to near 0. Finally, the data collected in this study have established an essential starting point for the obtention of new materials. Specifically, we plan for a future study to examine the obtention of a new class of rigid polyurethane foams that could be used in engineering applications.
