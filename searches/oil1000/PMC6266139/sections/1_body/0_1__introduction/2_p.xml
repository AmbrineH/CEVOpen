<p class="p">The synthesis of bio-polyols from fatty acids and vegetable oils has been the focus of many studies. It is important to note that vegetable oils, with the exception of castor and lesquerella oils, do not contain hydroxyl groups. For that reason, it is necessary to chemically modify the vegetable oils to introduce hydroxyl groups into their structures to produce polyols. There are five different pathways for vegetable oil-based bio-polyol production: (1) epoxidation and oxirane ring-opening [

 <xref rid="B14-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The first method is the most widely used. Researchers regularly use this method in one or two steps. “The one-step reaction consists of the in situ epoxidation followed by hydroxylation using acetic and sulfuric acids and hydrogen peroxide. The two-step reaction deals with the triglyceride epoxidation followed by the ring-opening of oxirane, based on the use of difunctional molecules such as alcohols or amines” [
