<p class="p">The high demand for products from petrochemical origin and their negative effects on the environment, parallel to the growing scarcity of these non-renewable resources, are factors that have encouraged the chemical industry to look for new sources of renewable resources as raw materials. These raw materials have contributed in a very positive way to the sustainable development of the plastics industry, due to the great synthetic potential of nature and different principles of green chemistry [
