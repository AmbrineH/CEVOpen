<p class="p">As can we see, the saturated fatty acids (SFAs) of the oils differ very little, because the percentage of palmitic acid, which is the main SFA, is similar in the two studied oils. On the other hand, the percentages of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), were 87.36and 88.23% for CIO and CSO, respectively. Specifically, the dominant constituents (over 80%) of both studied oils are C18 fatty acids, in spite of there also being about 7% of C20 fatty acids. The percentage value of linoleic acid (C 18:2) was observed in 31.11% and 20.40% for CIO and CSO, respectively. The main differences between CIO and CSO are derived from the percentage of linolenic acid (C 18:3), observed in 26.39 and 46.60, respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the chemical structures of linoleic and linolenic acids found in CIO and CSO. It is important to note that this difference in the distribution of the double bonds in the fatty acid chains is fundamental for knowing the possibilities of increasing OH groups in the polyols synthetized using these oils, and directly proportional to their potential as a future polyurethane foam.
