<p class="p">Finally, we also measured the kinematic viscosity and density for CIO and CSO. Generally, the kinematic viscosity is related to a measure of the internal friction or resistance of an oil to flow. According to Krisnangkura et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], viscosity may be considered the interaction forces of molecules. The viscosity values shown in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02244-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> were 58.6 and 48.8 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s for CIO and CSO, respectively. The difference in these values is due to the degree of unsaturation presented in both studied oils, and is in concordance with the results reported by Rodrigues Jr et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In this research, Rodrigues Jr reported that one double bond increased the viscosity, whereas two or three double bonds caused a decrease in the viscosity of the systems. On the other hand, density is an important physical characteristic of any substance, and is the weight of a unit volume of fluid [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. In this case, the values reported in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02244-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> are 0.884 and 0.896 g/cm

 <xref rid="materials-11-02244-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> (physical characteristics) of CIO and CSO had a drastic change in their numerical values when the oils became their respective polyols.
