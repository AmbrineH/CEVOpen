<p class="p">Taking into account the abovementioned and using the measured composition (lipid profile), we measured the degree of unsaturation by the iodine value (IV), which is directly related to the Cox value for CIO and CSO. The results for CIO and CSO indicated values of IV (143.8 and 179.3 g I
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/100 g, respectively) and Cox (9.35 and 12.46, respectively), providing it a particular resistance to oxidation. The saponification value (SN), which is a parameter related with the molecular mass of the fatty acids found in the oil, was also studied. The SN values for CIO and CSO were 196 and 194 mg KOH/g oil, respectively, which are in the average SN range of 175â€“250 mg/g reported for common vegetable oils [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. It should be noted that these values do not show significant differences, which means that the fatty acid composition of the studied oils are similar in molecular weight. It is known that acid value (AV) measures the number of carboxylic acid groups present in fat or oil; this value must not be too high, because it is a result of the hydrolysis of triglycerides. The highest acid value was found for CSO (0.25 mg KOH/g oil), however, the AV for both studied oils was less than 1.0 mg KOH/g oil (See 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02244-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), indicating that oils did not undergo hydrolytic processes. Additionally, the peroxide value (PV) of CIO and CSO were similar, and less than 20 meq/kg, respectively, indicating that these oils were unoxidized and of high initial quality.
