<p class="p">Furthermore, we determined the OH functionality, which is an important indicator of the crosslinking that can be obtained in future polyurethane foams. The OH numbers of the CIP and CSP were 225.0 and 240.8 mg KOH/g, respectively. The theoretical molecular weight (

 <xref rid="materials-11-02244-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> for CIP and CSP (1122.4 and 1166.1 g/mol, respectively) was calculated from the composition of polyols, based on assumption that no oligomers were formed, and considering that one OH group was formed per double bond. The OH functionality results showed values of 4.50 and 5.00 for CIP and CSP, respectively. It is important to note that these differences between the OH values were due to the fatty composition of the starting oils. According to these values, we can expect the preparation of rigid foams [
