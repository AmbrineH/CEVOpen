On the other hand, a quite different decomposition was observed for the CSP; its major decomposition occurred in three steps starting at 196.00, 305.10, and 428.24 °C, respectively. Specifically, the stage centered at 232.39 °C was caused presumably by the decomposition of the functionalized alpha-linolenic fatty acid chains. Furthermore, the main and biggest oil decomposition occurred between 305.10 and 428.24 °C, which was attributed to monounsaturated and saturated fatty acid decomposition, respectively. Finally, the last one had a weight loss centered at 435.68 °C, corresponding to the secondary thermal decomposition superimposed on the main reaction.
