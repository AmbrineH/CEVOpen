<p class="p">In order to investigate the influence of the structure and composition on thermal stability of the oils and polyols, thermogravimetric analysis was performed in the interval from 30 to 600 °C. The TG curves are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, respectively. Following the same analysis used for NMR and FTIR discussion, we compare the thermograms obtained for polyols and their respective oils. Analyzing the curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, the weight loss curves for the thermal degradation of both polyols closely resembles the TG curves of their starting oils. It is important to note that CIO and CSO are more thermally stable than their respective polyols. This behavior is probably related to the binding energy of the unsaturated chains functionalized during hydroxylation reactions. Specifically, the C=C and CH bonds present in the oils have binding energies of 614.2 and 413.4 kJ⋅mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively, which enables them to be more thermally stable than the CO bond present in polyols, which has a lower binding energy (353.5 kJ⋅mol
