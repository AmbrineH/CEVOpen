<p class="p">According to the TG curves shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a and c, CIP and CSP exhibited slightly less thermal stability compared to their oils. In addition, the initial weight loss observed under 100 °C in the TG curve, in both polyols, could be attributed to the loss of the residual toluene molecules, which, as commented before, was used in the polyol synthesis. In the oils at 100 °C, this weight loss was not observed. The total weight loss for both polyols was about 95%, meanwhile, the oils degraded completely [
 <xref rid="B42-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. We suggest that these results could be due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in the polyol.
