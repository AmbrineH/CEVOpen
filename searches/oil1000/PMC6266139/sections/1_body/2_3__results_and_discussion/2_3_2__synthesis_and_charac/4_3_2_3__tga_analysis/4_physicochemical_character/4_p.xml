<p class="p">Finally, we compared the results of polyols with other commercial polyols using the parameters described before, specifically OH functionality, such as epoxidized soybean (soy-H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B47-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], organosolv lignin, and soda lignin-based polyols with OH functionality values of 3.5, 6.0, and 9.0, respectively [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>,
