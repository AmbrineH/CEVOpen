<p class="p">The AV and SN for the polyol samples were higher when compared to the starting oils. It is important to mention that the CIP and CSP samples did not contain free acids, other than fatty acids; then, the acid value may be directly converted to percent free fatty acids. Hence, the slight increase in the AV and SN could be associated with the possible deterioration of the studied oils at the moment of producing polyols, such as rancidity. Dileesh et al. reported that the cause for rancidity is the hydrolytic or oxidative cleavage of triglycerides, causing the formation of free fatty acids in oils or fats [

 <xref rid="B44-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In this study, the authors mentioned that free fatty acids or compounds with hydroxy groups possessed significantly higher viscosity than the starting material without hydroxy groups. Additional proof that the hydrolysis reaction of CIO and CSO had occurred was reflected in the iodine values of their respective polyols. While examining the iodine values for the CIP and CSP and their respective oils, the values decreased dramatically, which was evident since the unsaturation (C=C bonds) in the CIO and CSO were replaced by hydroxyl groups.
