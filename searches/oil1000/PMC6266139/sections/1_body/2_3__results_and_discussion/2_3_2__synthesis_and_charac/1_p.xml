<p class="p">The main goal of our research was to prepare polyols from CIO and CSO, respectively. 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. salicifolia</italic> polyols (CIP and CSP, respectively) were prepared by a one-step synthesis using the acetic acid/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> system. The results reveal a wide difference of physicochemical characteristics among both obtained polyols and their starting oils. The measures of OH functionality was given an idea of the characteristics of the polyol obtained. For example, if the reaction was complete we obtained a polyol with high OH functionality. On the contrary, if the reaction was partial we obtained a polyol with remaining epoxy groups. These two results will be depending on the reaction conditions. As previously mentioned, we obtained CIP and CSP with OH numbers of 225.0 and 240.8 mg KOH/g (See 
 <xref rid="materials-11-02244-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), respectively. According to these values, it is evident that both hydroxylation reactions to obtain the CIP and CSP were complete, which are coherent with the NMR and FTIR results.
