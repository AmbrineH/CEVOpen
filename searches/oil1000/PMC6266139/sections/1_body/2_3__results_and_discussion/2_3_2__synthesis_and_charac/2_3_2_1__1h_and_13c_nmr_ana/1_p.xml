<p class="p">The functional group present in the CIP and CSP, with their respective starting oils, was confirmed by 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR, and FTIR analyses, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, respectively. It is known that polyols are a complex blend of products. For that reason, the NMR spectra analysis was performed by zone, because each zone gives indications about the average structure of polyols.
