<p class="p">Finally, it is important to mention that, in both polyol spectra, appear signals corresponding to the residual toluene used in the synthesis process. The signals corresponding to the toluene structure were found at δ 21.4, 125.2, 128.3, 129.2 ppm, and 2.35, 7.0–7.3 ppm for 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR and 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, respectively. This evidence confirmed that the elimination of toluene was ineffective.
