<p class="p">On the other hand, the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR spectra of CIP and CSP with their respective starting oils offer similar information (See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). These spectra were characterized by the almost disappearance of the ethenic double bond signs of both starting oils, and the appearance of a new sign in 75.32 ppm, which corresponds to –CH–OH groups formed during the epoxy-opened ring. In agreement with the results obtained by the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectra, the signals centered in 54.38 ppm, relative to the epoxide groups nonappearance, proved the formation of polyols. Furthermore, the signal found at 173–175 ppm, relative to the carbonyl ester, showed a peak present in both oils and polyols.
