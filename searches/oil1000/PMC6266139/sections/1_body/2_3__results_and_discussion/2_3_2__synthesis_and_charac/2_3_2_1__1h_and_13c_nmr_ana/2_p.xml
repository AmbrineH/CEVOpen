 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectra were the appearance of new peaks in the zone between 3.27 and 3.83 ppm, which are assigned to the presence of methylene protons attached to the hydroxyl group (–CH–OH). In addition, the signal corresponding to the olefinic hydrogen (–CH=CH–) that appeared in the zone between 5.32 and 5.44 ppm disappeared, suggesting that polyol structures were practically without unsaturation. However, the signal corresponding to the methynic hydrogen of the glycerol moiety between 5.18 and 5.30 ppm (ROOCH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CH(OOR) remained. Finally, the absence of signals in the zone between 2.8 and 3.2 ppm, relative to the epoxide groups (–CH(O)CH–), confirmed the occurrence of the hydroxylation reaction to obtain the CIP and CSP.
