<p class="p">In order to complement the NMR analysis, the successful conversion of CIO and CSO into polyols was confirmed qualitatively by FTIR spectroscopy. These spectra are compared in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-02244-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,c shows the FTIR spectra of CIP and CSP, respectively. Both polyols’ FTIR spectra exhibited a broad peak centered approximately at 3400 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which were assigned to the presence of a hydroxyl (–OH) stretching vibration. Another difference between CIP and CSP with their respective oils was the most intensive band (C=O, carbonyl stretching), attributed to the presence of the ester linkage. It slightly shifted from 1748.0 to 1738.8 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for CIO and CIP, respectively. The same behavior was found for CSO and the CSP, in this case. the band slightly shifted from 1743.7 to 1734.3 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. Another important asymmetrical stretching band present in both FTIR spectra polyols corresponded to C–O–C groups at 1158 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. It is important to mention that the absence of the bands at around 870 and 920 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, assigned to the epoxy groups in both spectra polyols, corroborate that the hydroxylation reaction of the oils was complete. Finally, the bands at 2919.6 and 2846.1 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and 2924.3 and 2850 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, assigned to asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching CH groups for CIP and CSP, respectively, were also detected. This evidence from FTIR analysis confirmed the formation of polyols, and the results obtained by
