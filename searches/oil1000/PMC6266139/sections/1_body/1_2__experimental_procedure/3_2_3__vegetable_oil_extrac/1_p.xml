<p class="p">Oil extraction was performed according to the AOAC method Am2-93 [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. About 250 g of 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> seeds were extracted using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (150 mL) as an extraction solvent in a Soxhlet apparatus. After 8 h, the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane was removed by distillation under reduced pressure at 40 °C. The obtained 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> orange oil (CIO) was stored at 4 °C under inert atmosphere until further investigation. The extraction was performed in triplicate for each harvested sample, obtaining a 26% yield. The same procedure was used for the 
 <italic class="italic">C. salicifolia</italic> but, in this case, the oil (CSO) obtained had a yellow coloration with 23% of yield.
