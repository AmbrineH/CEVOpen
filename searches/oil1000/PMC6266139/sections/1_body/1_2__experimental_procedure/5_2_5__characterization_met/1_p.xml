<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. salicifolia</italic> oils and polyols were characterized determining the fatty acid composition, the oxidizability value (Cox), acid value (AV), iodine value (IV), saponification number (SN), kinematic viscosity, peroxide value (PV), density, hydroxyl number, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy. It is important to note that the fatty acid composition, peroxide value, and the oxidizability value were performed only for the studied oils, and the rest of the characterization techniques were done for the 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. salicifolia</italic> oils and polyols.
