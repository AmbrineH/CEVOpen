<p class="p">The synthesis of the polyols was carried out following the methodology described by Monteavaro et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-materials-11-02244" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] with slight modifications. A solution of 5 g (5.6 mmol) of 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> oil and 9.30 mL (0.162 mol) of glacial acetic acid in 20 mL of toluene, with some drops of sulfuric acid, were placed into a 3-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and isobaric funnel. The mixture was mechanically stirred at room temperature until complete homogenization. After that, a solution of 30% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (5.30 mL) was slowly added controlling the temperature. When the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> addition was completed, the mixture was heated to 60 Â°C for 12 h. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and a 10% (w/v) sodium bisulfide solution was added, and the mixture was stirred for 20 min to eliminate excess peroxide. After that, 50 mL of ethyl ether was added to the mixture, and the organic phase was washed several times with 10% (w/v) sodium carbonate solution to neutral pH. Finally, the organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under vacuum to eliminate the ethyl ether to obtain the 
 <italic class="italic">C. integerrima</italic> polyol (CIP). The same procedure was used for the synthesis of 
 <italic class="italic">C. salicifolia</italic> polyol (CSP).
