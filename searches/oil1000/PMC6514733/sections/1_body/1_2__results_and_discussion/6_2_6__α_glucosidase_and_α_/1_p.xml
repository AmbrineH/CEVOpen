<p class="p">α-Amylase and α-glucosidase are the key enzymes that hydrolyze starch and other polysaccharides to monosaccharides and disaccharides in the small intestine. Furthermore, α-glucosidase inhibitors can retard the formation of glucose and treat type-2 pre-diabetic states. Therefore, α-glucosidase inhibition provides a prospective approach for preventing and treating type-2 diabetes [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>C. PD1-1 showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase activity from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of PD1-1 against α-glucosidase was calculated to be 0.53 mg/mL, which was higher than that of acarbose (0.13 mg/mL). The α-amylase inhibition activities of PD1-1 and acarbose are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>D. PD1-1 also showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on α-amylase activity from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of PD1-1 against α-amylase was calculated to be 0.40 mg/mL, which was higher than that of acarbose (0.15 mg/mL). Although the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of PD1-1 showed that it had a lower inhibitory activity than acarbose, PD1-1 still had a strong inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase and α-amylase. Furthermore, the α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities of the other two batches of PD1-1 that were obtained by the same purifying method were also determined and achieved similar results, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 0.51 ± 0.02 mg/mL and 0.42 ± 0.01 mg/mL, respectively (Figures not shown). These results indicate that PD1-1 has potential as an antidiabetic drug.
