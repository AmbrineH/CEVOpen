<p class="p">Crude polysaccharide was separated on a DEAEâ€“Sepharose fast flow anion-exchange column, eluting with distilled water and the stepwise addition of different NaCl solutions (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mol/L). According to the elution curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A), two polysaccharides were separated and designated as PD1 and PD2. The first fraction, PD1, was eluted by distilled water, while the second, PD2, was eluted by 0.2 mol/L NaCl. The pooled polysaccharide fraction (PD1) was then collected, concentrated, dialyzed, lyophilized, and further purified through a Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B, one fraction (PD1-1) was eluted by distilled water. PD1-1 was collected and used in the following experiments.
