<p class="p">These results indicate that PD1-1 has strong antioxidant activity, although its free radical scavenging ratio was lower than that of Vc. In addition, the DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging abilities of the other two bathes of PD1-1 that were obtained by the same purifying method were also determined and achieved similar results, with IC

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] found that scavenging activity of a low molecular weight polysaccharide against a superoxide radical was higher than that of one with a high molecular weight. The specific association between structure, physicochemical properties, and activity requires further research.
