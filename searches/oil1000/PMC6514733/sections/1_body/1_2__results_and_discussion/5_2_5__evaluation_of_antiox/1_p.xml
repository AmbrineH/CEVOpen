<p class="p">DPPH is an extremely stable free radical, while hydroxyl free radicals are extremely reactive. These radicals are commonly used to evaluate the free radical scavenging abilities of natural products [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The scavenging activity of PD1-1 and Vc toward DPPH radicals is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A. Both PD1-1 and Vc showed dose-dependent scavenging abilities for DPPH radicals over the concentrations of 0.05–0.5 mg/mL. The scavenging rate increased significantly from 0.05–0.3 mg/mL, with the highest PD1-1 scavenging rate (65.48%) observed at 0.5 mg/mL. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of PD1-1 was calculated to be 0.23 mg/mL, which was significantly higher than that of Vc. These results are consistent with previous research by Huang Dan [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which showed that a polysaccharide from dandelion had a remarkable scavenging ability for DPPH, with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.51 mg/mL. Therefore, PD1-1 showed a better scavenging ability than the above-mentioned polysaccharide. PD1-1 and Vc also showed hydroxyl radical scavenging abilities (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of PD1-1 was calculated to be 0.25 mg/mL.
