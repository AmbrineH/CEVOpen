<p class="p">The chemical composition of PD1-1 was analyzed. Polysaccharide PD1-1 mainly contained 95.35 ± 3.45% total sugars, 6.61 ± 0.22% uronic acid, and no protein, as determined by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 method producing no response. The molecular weight of PD1-1 was determined to be 2.6 kDa by high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), based on the calibration curve that had been established using dextran standards (

Monosaccharide composition analysis showed glucose (52.39%) was the major sugar in PD1-1, along with a considerable amount of mannose (45.41%). The major monosaccharides, glucose and mannose, had a molar ratio of approximately 1:1 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01485" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>), thus it was speculated that PD1-1 is a fructan, because fructose is a ketose, which is reduced to mannose and glucose when analyzed by GC-MS.
