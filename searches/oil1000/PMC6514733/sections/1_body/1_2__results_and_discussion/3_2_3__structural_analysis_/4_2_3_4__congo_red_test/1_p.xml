<p class="p">The triple-helix conformation of PD1-1 was analyzed using Congo red. According to previous reports, polysaccharides with triple helixes undergo a helix-coil transition with increasing alkali concentration, causing the maximum absorption wavelength (λ
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) to be redshifted or blueshifted relative to pure Congo red [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, with increasing NaOH concentration, the λ
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of Congo red combined with PD1-1 was redshifted. The highest value of λ
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was obtained when the NaOH concentration was 0.1 mol/L. Furthermore, the absorption decreased gradually with increasing NaOH concentration. This result indicates that PD1-1 exists as a triple helix structure.
