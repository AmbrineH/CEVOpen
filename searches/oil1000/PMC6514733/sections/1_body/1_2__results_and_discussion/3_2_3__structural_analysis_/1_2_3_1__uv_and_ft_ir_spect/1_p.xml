<p class="p">The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrum of PD1-1 is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A. PD1-1 showed no absorption at 260 and 280 nm, indicating the absence of protein. This was consistent with results of Bradford’s method. The FT-IR spectrum of PD1-1 was scanned in the range of 400–4000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, exhibiting a typical polysaccharide absorption peak. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01485-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B, the strong peak at 3431 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was attributed to O–H group stretching vibrations, the peak at around 2927 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was attributed to C–H group stretching vibrations, bands at 1637 and 1437 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were attributed to flexural vibrations of C=O groups, and the signal at 1031 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was attributed to C–O group stretching vibrations. The characteristic peaks at 935, 875, and 818 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were attributed to fructose with α-type and β-type glycosidic linkages simultaneously [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. These results confirmed that PD1-1 showed typical polysaccharide absorption peaks.
