<p class="p">After methylation of PD1-1, the methylated derivatives were analyzed using GC–MS. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01485-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the results showed that PD1-1 had two glycosidic linkages, namely 2,3,4,6-Me
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-Glc/Manp and 3,4,6-Me
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-Glc/Manf linkages, with contents of 2 and 14 mol%, respectively. These results show that PD1-1 mainly contains α-
