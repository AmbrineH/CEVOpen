<p class="p">The physicochemical properties of PD1-1 are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01485-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. PD1-1 is an odorless pale yellow powder soluble in water and insoluble in ethanol, methanol, and acetone. PD1-1 had the highest swelling capacity (SC) in distilled water, followed by phosphate buffer, with the lowest SC in 0.1 mol/L HCl, indicating that PD1-1 is sensitive to pH. The high SC of PD1-1 implies that the polymer could be used as a binder agent. The relatively higher water holding capacity (WHC) (9.57 ± 0.29 g/g) of PD1-1 compared to polysaccharides from potatoes peels [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] suggests that it could be used in many gourmet foods that require moisture. The pH value of PD1-1 was 6.47 ± 0.11, indicating that PD1-1 is a neutral sugar. The oil holding capacity (OHC) value of PD1-1 was calculated to be 4.36 ± 0.28 g/g. A similar OHC has been reported for potatoes peels (4.398 ± 0.04 g/g), suggesting that PD1-1 might be applied in the food industry. These results demonstrate that PD1-1 might be a suitable for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
