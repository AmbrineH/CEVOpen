<p class="p">PD1-1 polysaccharide was dissolved in distilled water to a final concentration of 5% and analyzed using UV–vis spectrophotometry. The UV absorption spectrum of the sample was recorded in the 200–400 nm wavelength range. FT-IR spectra of PD1-1 were recorded using an FT-IR spectrometer by mixing the sample (2 mg) thoroughly with KBr powder (100 mg) and pressing into a disk. The FT-IR spectrum of PD1-1 was recorded in the 400–4000 cm
