<p class="p">Methylation analysis of PD1-1 was conducted according to a previously reported method [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Briefly, PD1-1 was dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 1 mL), and solid NaOH was added to the solution under a nitrogen atmosphere. The sample was then methylated with CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>I, and the permethylated sample was hydrolyzed with 2 mol/L TFA at 121 °C for 1.5 h. After reduction and acetylation of the hydrolysates, the sample was analyzed by GC–MS using an RXI-5 SIL MS column.
