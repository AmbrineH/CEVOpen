<p class="p">PD1-1 (30 mg) was dissolved in 99.9% D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (0.6 mL). 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded using an AV-500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm CPQCI 1H-31P/13C/15N/D Z-GRD cryoprobe with samples in 5-mm NMR tubes [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Spectra were obtained at 25 °C using 120 scans. Data processing was performed using standard Bruker Topspin-NMR software (AVANCE III, Bruker Corp., Fällanden, Switzerland).
