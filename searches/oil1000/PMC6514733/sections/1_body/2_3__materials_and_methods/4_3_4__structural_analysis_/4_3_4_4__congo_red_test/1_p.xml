<p class="p">The Congo red test was performed according to a previously reported method with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. First, the sample solution (1 mL, 2 mg/mL) was mixed with a NaOH solution (1 mL; 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, or 1 mol/L). This process afforded NaOH solutions with final concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mol/L. Next, Congo red (2 mL, 80 μmol) was added and mixed thoroughly. A sample solution without NaOH was used as reference. Furthermore, the maximum absorption wavelength was scanned using a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) in the 200–600 nm wavelength range after incubating for 10 min at room temperature.
