<p class="p">The molecular weight of PD1-1 was determined by HPGPC using a Shimadzu LC-10A system equipped with a Waters 2410 refractive index detector (Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The mobile phase was double-distilled water (ddH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min and a temperature of 40 °C. A 10 μL sample of PD1-1 solution (2.0 mg/mL) was injected into the chromatography system for each run. The molecular weight of PD1-1 was calculated by comparison with the calibration curve obtained from dextran standards (5.0–670 kDa).
