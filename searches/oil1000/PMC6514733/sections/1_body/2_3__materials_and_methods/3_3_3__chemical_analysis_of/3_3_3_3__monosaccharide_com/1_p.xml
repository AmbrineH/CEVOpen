<p class="p">The monosaccharide composition was determined by GC–MS following a previously reported procedure. The polysaccharide samples (2 mg) were dissolved in 2 mol/L trifluoracetic acid (TFA; 1 mL) in a closed tube. After hydrolysis at 110 °C for 90 min, the hydrolysate was dried in a vacuum evaporator and then dissolved in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (2 mL) containing NaBH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (60 mg) at room temperature for 8 h. The evaporation step was then repeated under reduced pressure to remove the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O after neutralization with glacial acetic acid. The samples were cooled and acetic anhydride (1 mL) was added. The mixture was incubated at 100 °C for 1 h and the evaporation step was then repeated under reduced pressure to remove the acetic anhydride with toluene (3 mL). The acetylated hydrolysate was extracted with chloroform and dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate. The monosaccharide composition was analyzed by GC–MS and identified according to characteristic retention times. Mannose, rhamnose, fucose, xylose, glucose, galactose, and arabinose were used as monosaccharide standards.
