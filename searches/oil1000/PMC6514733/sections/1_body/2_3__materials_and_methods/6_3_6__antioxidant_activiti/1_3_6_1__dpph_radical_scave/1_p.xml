<p class="p">The DPPH radical scavenging activity of PD was determined using a previously reported method with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Briefly, a DPPH solution (2.0 mL, 0.1 mmol/L in ethanol) was mixed with a PD solution (2.0 mL) at various concentrations. After mixing rapidly, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Distilled water was used as the blank control, and vitamin C (Vc) was used as the positive control. The DPPH radical scavenging activity (RSA) was calculated according to the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">DPPH RSA (%) = [1 − (
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> − 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">1</sub>)/
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">0</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the absorbance of a mixture of the sample and the DPPH solution, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> is the absorbance of the sample without the DPPH solution, and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the absorbance of the DPPH solution without the sample.
