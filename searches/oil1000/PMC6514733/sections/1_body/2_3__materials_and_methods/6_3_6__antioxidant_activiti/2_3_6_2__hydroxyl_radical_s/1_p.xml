<p class="p">The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of PD was estimated using a previously reported Fenton-type reaction with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Sample solutions (1 mL) of various concentrations were mixed with FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (1 mL, 9 mmol/L), salicylic acid (1 mL, 9 mmol/L), and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1 mL, 9 mmol/L) solutions. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at 510 nm. Distilled water was used as the blank control and Vc was used as the positive control. The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was calculated according to the following equation:
