<p class="p">α-amylase inhibitory activity was determined using the method reported by Wang with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Briefly, sample solutions (1 mL) were mixed with α-amylase (1 mL, 1.0 U/mL) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. A starch solution (1 mL, 1%) was then added, followed by incubation for a further 10 min at 37 °C. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS; 2 mL) while heating over a boiling water bath for 5 min. The reaction mixture was diluted by adding distilled water and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Acarbose was used as the positive control. The α-amylase inhibition rate was calculated using the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">α-Amylase inhibition rate (%) = [1 − (
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> − 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">1</sub>)/
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">0</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the absorbance of the sample solution, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> is the absorbance of the starch and sample solution without adding the enzyme, and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the absorbance of the starch solution with the enzyme and without adding the sample.
