<p class="p">The α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was determined using the method reported by Zhang with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Briefly, the reaction mixture containing a phosphate buffer (2 mL, 0.1 mol/L, pH 6.8), α-glucosidase (0.1 mL, 0.2 U/mL), and the sample solution (1 mL) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. P-nitrophenyl-β-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galactopyranoside (PNPG; 250 μL) was then added, followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The catalytic reaction was terminated by adding Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solution (2 mL, 0.1 mol/L). Acarbose was used as the positive control and the absorbance was measured at 400 nm. The α-glucosidase inhibition rate was calculated using the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">α-Glucosidase inhibition rate (%) = [1 − (

  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
  <sub class="sub">0</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the absorbance of the sample solution, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> is the absorbance of the PNPG and sample solution without adding the enzyme, and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the absorbance of PNPG solution with the enzyme and without the sample.
