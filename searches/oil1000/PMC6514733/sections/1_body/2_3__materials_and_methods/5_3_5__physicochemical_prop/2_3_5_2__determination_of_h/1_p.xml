 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) occupied by PD1-1 (500 mg) in a test tube was recorded. Next, distilled water (10 mL) was added, the mixture was allowed to stand for 12 h at room temperature, and the new volume (
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) of the wetted powder was recorded. This test was repeated using a phosphate buffer (pH 6.86) and 0.1 mol/L HCl instead of distilled water. The SC was calculated using the following formula: SC (%) = (
