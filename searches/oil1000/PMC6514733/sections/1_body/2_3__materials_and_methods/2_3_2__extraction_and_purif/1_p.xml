<p class="p">Air-dried dandelion (1 kg) was pulverized and passed through a 60-mesh sieve. Fat and colored materials were removed using petroleum ether and 95% ethanol by refluxing, respectively. The residues were air-dried using a thermostatic blast drying oven at 50 °C. The pretreated dandelion powder was extracted with deionized water (1:25,
