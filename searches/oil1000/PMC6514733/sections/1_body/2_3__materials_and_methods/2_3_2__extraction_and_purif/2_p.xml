<p class="p">Crude PD was fractionated using a DEAE–Sepharose fast flow column (10 × 60 cm). Crude PD (10 g) was dissolved in distilled water (50 mL), centrifuged, and transferred onto the column. Gradient elution was performed using distilled water followed by different concentrations of gradient NaCl solution (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mol/L) at 4 mL/min. The eluate was collected and elution peaks of the polysaccharides were monitored using a phenol sulfuric acid method (PSAM) at 490 nm [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The main fraction was pooled, desalted, concentrated, and further purified using a Sephadex G-75 column (2.6 × 60 cm) which was eluted with distilled water at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The elution peaks were monitored by PSAM and the fraction was collected, denoted as PD1-1.
