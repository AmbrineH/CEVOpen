<p class="p">Dandelion (
 <italic class="italic">Taraxacum mongolicum</italic>), a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, is widely distributed in the northern regions of China, including Gansu, Shanxi, and Xinjiang [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Dandelion is known for its applications in the production of drinks, liquor, and toiletries, for its identified pharmacological functions, including detoxification and diuresis, and its antibacterial and antitumor properties, which have resulted in its frequent use in traditional Chinese medicine [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Dandelion roots, leaves, and flowers contain many pharmaceutical ingredients, such as phenolics, sterols, flavonoids, and polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Polysaccharides from dandelion (PD) have also been reported to regulate metabolism and pathological processes owing to anticomplement, antitumor, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Many PD extraction methods have been investigated, including hot water extraction, enzyme extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, the separation, purification, and exhaustive structural characterization of PD have been lacking. Therefore, efficient and accurate analytical methods for elucidating PD structures are required.
