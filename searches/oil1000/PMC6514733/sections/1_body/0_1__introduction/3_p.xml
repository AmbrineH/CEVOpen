<p class="p">The present study aimed to separate and purify polysaccharides, and explore the structures and functions of the purified polysaccharide fraction. An ultrasound-assisted method was used to extract polysaccharides from dandelion from Xinjiang province. Purified fractions of dandelion polysaccharides were obtained by chromatography through diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)–Sepharose fast flow columns and then Sephadex G-75 columns. The physicochemical properties and structures of the purified fractions were determined using Fourier transform infrared (FT–IR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, colorimetric determination with Congo red, and high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Moreover, the in vitro antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities of the purified polysaccharide were evaluated by the assay of free radical scavenging activities and enzyme inhibitory activities. This strategy could be promising for application to novel functional foods or drugs with polysaccharides as ingredients.</p>
