<p class="p">Polysaccharides are essential functional substances composed of various monosaccharide sugars and are usually found in animals, plants, and microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Polysaccharides play an important role in the growth and development of organisms [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Plant polysaccharides are also known to possess multiple biological activities, including antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], antitumor [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], anti-hyperglycemic [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], and immune regulation [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] activities, which are closely related to their physicochemical properties. Natural polysaccharides are suitable potential candidates for preventing and treating diseases due to their nontoxicity and negligible side effects compared with synthetic medicines [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01485" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Therefore, much research has been devoted to the discovery and investigation of natural polysaccharides.
