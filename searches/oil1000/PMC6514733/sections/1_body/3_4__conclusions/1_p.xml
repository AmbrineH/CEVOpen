<p class="p">In the present study, a crude polysaccharide from dandelion was prepared using an ultrasound-assisted extraction method, with one purified fraction (PD1-1) obtained by chromatography using DEAE–Sepharose fast flow and Sephadex G-75 columns. The monosaccharide composition showed that PD1-1 is an inulin-type polysaccharide with glucose (52.39%) and mannose (45.41%) as the main components. Molecular weight analysis showed that PD1-1 has a molecular weight of 2.6 kDa. Glycosidic linkage analysis showed that PD1-1 contains α-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Man/Glcp-(1→ and →1)-β-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Man/Glcf-(2→ glycosidic linkage conformations. Furthermore, PD1-1 has a triple-helix structure and exhibits important physicochemical properties, including good SC, WHC, and OHC values. Furthermore, the in vitro antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities of PD1-1 were determined, showing strong biological activities that are concentration-dependent. Therefore, we predict that PD1-1 could be widely applied in the pharmaceutical and food industries. However, the in vivo functional properties of PD1-1 are still unclear, and research into its in vivo structure–activity relationship is ongoing on.
