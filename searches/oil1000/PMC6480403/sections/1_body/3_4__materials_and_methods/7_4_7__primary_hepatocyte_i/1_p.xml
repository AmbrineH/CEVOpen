<p class="p">The isolation and culture of primary hepatocyte from large yellow croaker was performed according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The fatty acids, bovine serum albumin/fatty acid complexes of ALA, LA, and PA (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) were supplemented to cells in 6-well plates at a range of concentrations, 100 or 200 μM, for 6 h or 12 h in triplicate wells. The hepatocytes of large yellow croaker were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated with 4 μM of bexarotene (MCE) for 12 and 24 h in triplicate wells, respectively. The hepatocytes of large yellow croaker were also incubated with 4 and 8 μM of UVI 3003 for 1 h in triplicate wells. After incubation, cells were lysed in the wells and harvested for RNA extraction.
