<p class="p">The SQ Tissue DNA Kit (OMEGA, Norcross, GA, USA) was used to extracted Genomic DNA from the liver in large yellow croaker according to manufacturer’s instructions. The gene-specific primers for 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter cloning were designed according to the large yellow croaker genomic DNA (National Center of Biotechnology Information, NCBI). The program for 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter cloning was performed by PrimeSTAR® Max DNA Polymerase (Takara, Japan) with the following parameters: 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. Then, the product of PCR was inserted into pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as a reporter plasmid.
