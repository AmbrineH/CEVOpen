<p class="p">PCR primers of the first fragment for 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> cloning were designed based on sequence (XM_010729493.3). One microliter of liver cDNA, 1 μL of each primer, 12.5 μL of PrimeSTAR® Max DNA Polymerase (Takara, Japan) and 9.5 μL RNA-free water was added in a 25 μL mixture. The PCR program was performed with the following parameters: 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) primers were designed from the sequence of the first 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> fragment. SMARTerTM RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, CA, USA) was used to clone the 3′- and 5′-end sequence of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR program was performed as described above. Then, the PCR products was cloned into pEASY-T1 simple cloning plasmid (TransGen, Beijing, China) for sequencing.
