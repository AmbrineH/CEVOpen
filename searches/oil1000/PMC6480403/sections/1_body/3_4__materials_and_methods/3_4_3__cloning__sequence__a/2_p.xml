<p class="p">The amino acid (AA) sequence of cloned large yellow croaker 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> cDNA was aligned to orthologues from other vertebrate species. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced AA sequences of the Elovl6 proteins from large yellow croaker was performed using Mega 4.0. and phylogenetic trees were formed by the neighbor joining method [
