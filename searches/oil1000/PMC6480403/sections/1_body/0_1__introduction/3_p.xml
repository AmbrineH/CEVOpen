<p class="p">Large yellow croaker (
 <italic class="italic">Larimichthys crocea</italic>), a particularly notable marine fish with high commercial value in southeast China, belongs to Sciaeni-dae family. It has been a useful model for studying fatty acid (FA) metabolism and lipid deposition of fish [
