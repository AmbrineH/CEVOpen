 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of Elovl6 function in mice increased the contents of C16:0 and C16:1n-7, and decreased C18:0 and C18:1n-7 contents [

 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The recent study in mammals demonstrated that the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> was altered by dietary lipid supplementation [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Furthermore, Elovl6 is regulated directly or indirectly by lipogenic transcription factors including SREBP-1c, carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREB) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) [
