<p class="p">Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are predominantly synthesized in the liver by desaturations and elongations, which contributes a special function for normal physiological metabolism [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Elongation of very long-chain fatty acids proteins (Elovl), as rate-limiting enzymes, play a crucial role in the elongation step of LCFAs biosynthesis. Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6 (Elovl6) acts to convert palmitate (C16: 0) or palmitoleic acid (C16:1 n-7) to stearate (C18:0) or vaccenic acid (C18:1 n-7) [
