<p class="p">The relative mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in the liver of large yellow croaker was remarkably affected by dietary fatty acids (

 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> gene in the liver of large yellow croaker fed the diets with soybean oil (SO), linseed oil (LO), or palm oil (PO) were significantly higher than that in croaker fed the diet with fish oil (FO) (
