<p class="p">The promoter of large yellow croaker 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>, an upstream sequence of 2021 bp adjacent to the start of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> was cloned to characterize the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>. Using bioinformatics software including JASPAR, TRANSFAC, and TF binding, several transcriptional factors binding sites including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β (CEBPβ), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), transcriptional factor SP1 (SP1), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), ChREB, SREBP1, SREBP2, LXRα, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB1) were predicted within the 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter region of large yellow croaker. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that the transcription factor HNF1α, CEBPβ, RXRα, ChREB, SREBP2, and CREB1 upregulated the promoter activity of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> by 1.78-fold, 2.35-fold, 2.32-fold, 1.80-fold, 1.51-fold, and 2.68-fold, respectively. Interestingly, PPARγ, SP1, SREBP1, and LXRα, as important transcription factors in regulation of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in mammals, showed no significantly regulatory effect on 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter in large yellow croaker (
