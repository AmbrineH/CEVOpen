<p class="p">In order to verify the speculation above, 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter luciferase reporter plasmid and the transcription factors expression plasmids were cotransfected into HEK293T cells in the dual-luciferase reporter assay. The studies in mouse suggested that the 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter could be activated by SREBP1c and synergistically activated by both ChREB/Mlx and SREBP1c [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the transcription factor LXRα could regulate the expression of SREBP1c and ChREB, thus 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> could be regulated by LXRα directly or indirectly [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. In mammals, the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> could be regulated by the transcription factors including PPARα and PPARγ [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], and SREBP1 and SP1 could increase the bovine 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter activity [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. However, the transcription factors PPARγ, SP1, SREBP1, and LXRα showed no significant regulatory activity on 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter in large yellow croaker, and only the SREBP2 and ChREB showed activation of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter activity. The results indicated that the regulation mechanisms of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in fish might be different from mammals. It may be correlated with difference in the requirements of essential fatty acids and evolutionary spectacle in two species. Furthermore, transcription factors including HNF1α, CEBPβ, RXRα, and CREB1 could upregulate the activity of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> promoter in large yellow croaker. Meanwhile, the RXRα agonist (Bexarotene) could greatly increase the transcriptional expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>, and the RXRα antagonist (UVI 3003) suppressed the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in large yellow croaker. Thus, the transcription factor RXRα could be a potential target in future studies aiming to regulate the transcriptional expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>. The studies on regulatory effect of these transcription factors (HNF1α, CEBPβ, RXRα, and CREB1) in fish or mammals mainly focused on other genes related to lipid metabolism, with almost no study on 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>, and the finding may contribute to a further understanding of the regulation mechanism of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>.
