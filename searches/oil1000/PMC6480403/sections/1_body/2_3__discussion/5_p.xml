<p class="p">In conclusion, the cDNA of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> was cloned from large yellow croaker and 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> contained the typical features of Elovl proteins. Elovl6 promoter activity was positively regulated by the transcription factors, HNF1α, CEBPβ, RXRα, and CREB1. Furthermore, large yellow croaker treated with LA or ALA resulted in greatly increased expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>, and this increase was likely regulated by transcription factors including HNF1α, CEBPβ, RXRα, and CREB1.
