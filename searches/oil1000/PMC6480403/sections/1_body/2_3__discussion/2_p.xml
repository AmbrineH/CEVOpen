<p class="p">In mammals, 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> is highly expressed in lipogenic organs and is sensitive to the diets [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In the present study, the highest expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in large yellow croaker was observed in the liver, and the relative mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> was remarkably affected by fatty acids 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>. The qPCR data for the 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in the liver of croaker fed the diets with PO and hepatocytes treated with PA was significantly higher than that of the controls. PA is the substrate for synthesis of C18:0 and C18:1n-9 as substrate [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Hence, the accumulation of PA may promote the transcriptional expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> to drive synthesis of C18:0 and C18:1n-9 using C16:0 as a substrate [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in the liver of croaker fed the diets with SO and LO was significantly higher than that in croaker fed the diet with FO. Correspondingly, the 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in hepatocytes treated with LA and ALA was remarkably increased compared to the controls. LA or ALA is the substrate for LC-PUFA synthesis, which is catalyzed by fatty acid desaturases (Fads) and elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (Elovl) [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that transcription factors played crucial role in expression of genes [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Thus, it could be speculated that the expression of transcription factors targeting 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> may be increased with the treatment of LA and ALA, which upregulated the transcriptional expression of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic>.
