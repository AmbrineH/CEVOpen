<p class="p">The Elovl6 protein has been confirmed to catalyze the key step in the elongation of C16: 0 to C18: 0 [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Previous studies showed that suppression or deletion of Elovl6 lead to changes in fatty acids composition with decreased stearate (C18:0) and increased palmitate (C16:0) in mice [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. However, there is almost no study about Elovl6 in fish. In the present study, the cDNA for 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> gene was cloned from large yellow croaker, and the cDNA exhibited characteristic features of Elovl protein family members, including a single histidine box (HXXHH) and six transmembrane regions [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that deduced amino acid sequence of Elovl6 were highly similar to teleosts and mammals.
