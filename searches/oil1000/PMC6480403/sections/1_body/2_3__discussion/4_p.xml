<p class="p">Previous studies have suggested that that 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> could be regulated by dietary long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) via transcription factors [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which is consistent with the findings of the present study. Here, the transcriptional expression of 
 <italic class="italic">hnf1α</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cebpβ</italic> in the liver of large yellow croaker fed the diets with replacement of FO with SO or LO was increased. Correspondingly, the relative expression of 
 <italic class="italic">hnf1α</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">cebpβ</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">rxrα</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">creb1</italic> in hepatocytes treated with LA and ALA was remarkably increased. This is consistent with the changes of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in response to fatty acids 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>, and the results suggested that the increase in expression of the transcription factors may be attributed to the increase of 
 <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in croaker treating with ALA or LA.
