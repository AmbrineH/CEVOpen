 <p class="p">Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6 (Elovl6) is a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, which participates in converting palmitate (C16:0) to stearate (C18:0). Although studies of Elovl6 have been carried out in mammals, the nutritional regulation of 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in fish remains poorly understood. In the present study, the cloning and nutritional regulation of 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> were determined in large yellow croaker. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the full-length cDNA of 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> was 1360 bp, including an open reading frame of 810 bp encoding a putative protein of 269 amino acid that possesses the characteristic features of Elovl proteins. The transcript level of 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> was significantly increased in the liver of croaker fed the diets with soybean oil (enriched with 18: 2n-6, LA) or linseed oil (enriched with 18: 3n-3, ALA) than that in croaker fed the diet with fish oil (enriched with 20: 5n-3 and 22: 6n-3). Correspondingly, the 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in croaker’s hepatocytes treated with ALA or LA was remarkably increased compared to the controls. Furthermore, the transcription factors including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β (CEBPβ), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), and cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) greatly enhanced promoter activity of 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in large yellow croaker, and the expression of transcription factors is consistent with the changes of 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in response to fatty acids 
  <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>. In conclusion, this study revealed that 
  <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in large yellow croaker could be upregulated by dietary ALA or LA via the increased transcriptional expression of transcription factors including 
  <italic class="italic">hnf1α</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">cebpβ</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">rxrα</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">creb1</italic>.
