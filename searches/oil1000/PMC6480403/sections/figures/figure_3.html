 <p> Phylogenetic tree comparing Elovl6 of large yellow croaker with other vertebrate counterparts. The tree was constructed by the neighbor joining method in MEGA4 [ 20]. The horizontal branch length is proportional to amino acid substitution rate per site. The numbers represent the frequencies (%) with which the tree topology presented was replicated after 1000 iterations. </p>
