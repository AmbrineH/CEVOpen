 <p> Effects of graded amounts of α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) on hnf1α, cebpb, rxrα, and creb1 expression in hepatocytes of large yellow croaker cultured for 6 h or 12 h. hnf1α with ALA ( A) or LA ( B) for 6 h or 12 h; cebpβ with ALA ( C) or LA ( D); rxrα with ALA ( E) or LA ( F) for 6 h or 12 h; creb1 with ALA (G) or LA (H) for 6 h or 12 h. The expression in control group was selected for normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. ( n = 3). Means that share the same superscript letter are not significantly different, as determined by Tukey’s test ( p &gt; 0.05). </p>
