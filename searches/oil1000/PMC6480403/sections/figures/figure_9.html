 <p> The transcriptional expression of hnf1α ( A), cebpβ ( B), rxrα ( C), and creb1 ( D) in the liver of large yellow croaker fed the diets with fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), and linseed oil (LO). The expression in FO was selected as normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. ( n = 3). Means that share the same superscript letter are not significantly different, as determined by Tukey’s test ( p &gt; 0.05). </p>
