  <p class="p">Phylogenetic tree comparing Elovl6 of large yellow croaker with other vertebrate counterparts. The tree was constructed by the neighbor joining method in MEGA4 [
   <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01801" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The horizontal branch length is proportional to amino acid substitution rate per site. The numbers represent the frequencies (%) with which the tree topology presented was replicated after 1000 iterations.
