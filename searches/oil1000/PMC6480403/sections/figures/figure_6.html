 <p> Effects of graded amounts of α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) on elovl6 expression in hepatocytes of large yellow croaker cultured for 12 h. Large yellow croaker hepatocytes cultured with ALA for 12 h ( A); Large yellow croaker hepatocytes cultured with LA for 12 h ( B); Large yellow croaker hepatocytes cultured with PA for 12 h ( C). The expression of elvol6 in control group was selected as normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. ( n = 3). Means that share the same superscript letter are not significantly different, as determined by Tukey’s test ( p &gt; 0.05). </p>
