  <p class="p">Effects of graded amounts of α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) on 
   <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> expression in hepatocytes of large yellow croaker cultured for 12 h. Large yellow croaker hepatocytes cultured with ALA for 12 h (

   <italic class="italic">elvol6</italic> in control group was selected as normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3). Means that share the same superscript letter are not significantly different, as determined by Tukey’s test (
