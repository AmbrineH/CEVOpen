 <p> The influence of overexpression of transcription factors on elovl6 promoter activity in large yellow croaker. The negative control Nic (pGL3-basic) was an empty plasmid with no promoter sequence. The elovl6 promoter was co-transfected with overexpression plasmids of transcription factor HNF1α (H); CEBPβ (C); PPARγ (P); SP1 (S); RXRα (R); ChREB (CH), SREBP1 (S1); SREBP2 (S2); LXRα (La); and CREB1 (CB), compared with the control group (L) transfected with pGL3- elovl6 promoter only. The luciferase activity in Nic group was selected as normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. ( n = 3). * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01. </p>
