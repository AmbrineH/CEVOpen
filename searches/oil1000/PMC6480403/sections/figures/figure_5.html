 <p> The transcriptional expression of elovl6 in the liver of large yellow croaker fed the diets with fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), linseed oil (LO), or palm oil (PO). The expression of elvol6 in FO was selected as normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. ( n = 3). Means that share the same superscript letter are not significantly different, as determined by Tukey’s test ( p &gt; 0.05). </p>
