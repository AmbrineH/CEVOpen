 <p> The effects of RXRα agonist (4 μM) ( A) and antagonist ( B) on the transcriptional expression of the elovl6 in hepatocytes of large yellow croaker. The expression of elovl6 in hepatocytes treated with agonist or antagonist was compared with the control group. The expression of elvol6 in the control group was selected for normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. ( n = 3). * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01. </p>
