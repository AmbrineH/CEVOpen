  <p class="p">The transcriptional expression of 
   <italic class="italic">elovl6</italic> in the liver of large yellow croaker fed the diets with fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), linseed oil (LO), or palm oil (PO). The expression of 
   <italic class="italic">elvol6</italic> in FO was selected as normalization. Data were presented as means ± S.E.M. (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3). Means that share the same superscript letter are not significantly different, as determined by Tukey’s test (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
