 <p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are known for their antioxidant properties, and are widely employed in the food industry as preservatives. They can be used as condiments or as preservatives to achieve certain organoleptic effects for consumers. The aim of this research was to evaluate antioxidant activity in mixtures of three EOs: 
  <italic class="italic">Apium graveolens</italic> L.
  <italic class="italic">, Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. and 
  <italic class="italic">Coriandrum sativum</italic> L., using the Simplex Lattice Mixture Design. Ultimately, a linear model was used, as it best adjusted to the experimental behavior, and it allowed the prediction of EOs mixtures antioxidant activity, determined by FRAP and ABTS techniques. The mixture of the three EOs that showed the best antioxidant activity and also had the highest synergistic effect, was composed of 66.7% of 
  <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic>, 16.7% of 
  <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> and 16.7% of 
  <italic class="italic">A. graveolens</italic>. The greatest contribution to the potentiation of antioxidant activity was shown by 
  <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> followed by 
  <italic class="italic">A. graveolens</italic> and then 
  <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic>.
