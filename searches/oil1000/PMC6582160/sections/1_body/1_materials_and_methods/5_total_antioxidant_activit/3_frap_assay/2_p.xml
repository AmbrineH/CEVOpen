At the beginning, 80 μL of each EO mixture was placed in a 10 mL volumetric flask and 5 mL of a FRAP reagent was added. After being filled with distilled water, the volumetric flask was shaken and allow to stand for 30 min at 37 °C in a RY-DHG-9030A electric heat laboratory oven. No phase separation was observed since the sample completely reacted with FRAP reagent (
