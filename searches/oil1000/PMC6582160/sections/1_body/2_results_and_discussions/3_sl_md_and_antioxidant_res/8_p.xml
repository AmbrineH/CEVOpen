<p id="p0145" class="p">In the prepared mixtures where the 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> was in 66.7% proportion, the activity was higher, regardless of the second ingredient in the mixture (exp. 6). However, the obtained activity was always higher for the mixtures than for the pure 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> essential oil. This could be indicative of the potentiated properties of the mixtures compared to the those of the essential oils individually (see 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The following mixture proportions showed high values of antioxidant activity and also greater synergism: 66.7% 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic>, 16.7% 
 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic> and 16.7% 
 <italic class="italic">A. graveolens</italic>.
