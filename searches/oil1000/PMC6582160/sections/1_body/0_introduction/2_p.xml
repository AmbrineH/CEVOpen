<p id="p0010" class="p">Essential oils (EOs) are volatile aromatic compounds generated from secondary metabolism in plants. Each EO is composed of between a dozen and several hundred components, which mainly consist of terpenes and terpenoids including oxygenated derivatives, such as aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, esters and epoxides (
