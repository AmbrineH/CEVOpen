<p id="p0020" class="p">Research regarding the synergistic effects of these plants in other mixtures is still limited. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the synergistic effect of mixed EOs by Simplex Lattice Mixture Design (SL-MD). In this study, the antioxidant properties depend only on the percentage of each component in the mixtures. SL-MD was preferred, as it is a tool widely used for evaluating the constituent factors and their response effects (
