<p class="p">The main pharmacological active compound in 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> is the essential oil and the biological activities of the extracted essential oil have been investigated. For example, it has been reported that 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil showed anti-histaminic effects and antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> volatile oil had strong antibacterial effects against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enteritidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been proved to be an useful method for the determination of the different essential oil components. Recently, the composition of essential oil extracted from leaves and flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">A. argui</italic> has been reported [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and the major components were sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, alcohols, ketones, aromatic compounds esters and ethers, etc. Based on the appealing aromatic properties, 
 <italic class="italic">A. argui</italic> essential oil could play a significant role in food safety and preservation [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. At present, most preservatives used by the food industry are artificial additives such as nitrates, sulphur dioxide and benzoates [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Natural compounds may have great commercial value in the food industry, however their applications are currently limited owing to their high cost. Hence, an effective and low-cost preparation method is needed.
