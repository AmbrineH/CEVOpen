 <p> Lipid mediators derived from AA, EPA, and DHA. Various kinds of lipid mediators are produced from ω6- and ω3-PUFAs. AA, EPA, and DHA are converted to bioactive lipid mediators by the enzymatic activities of COX, LOX, and CYP. Lipid mediators exert their biological effects through binding to G-protein-coupled receptors. AA-derived lipid mediators have pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, whereas EPA- and DHA-derived lipid mediators exert anti-inflammatory or pro-resolution activities or both. </p>
