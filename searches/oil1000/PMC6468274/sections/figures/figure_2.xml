  <p class="p">17,18-EpETE is a new class of anti-allergy and anti-inflammatory lipid mediator. 17,18-EpETE is produced by CYP from EPA. 17,18-EpETE suppresses contact hypersensitivity by reducing neutrophil infiltration into the skin by inhibiting Rac activation and migration through GPR40 signaling. 17,18-EpETE also indirectly inhibits the development of food allergy by inhibiting mast cell degranulation. Given that mast cells do not express GPR40, the detailed mechanisms responsible for this inhibition of mast cell degranulation remain unclear.</p>
