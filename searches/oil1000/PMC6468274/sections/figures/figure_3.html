 <p> Physiological functions of CLA and HYA. CLA and HYA are produced from linoleic acid by intestinal bacteria. c9, t11-CLA ameliorates insulin sensitivity and prevents atherosclerosis, t10, c12-CLA deteriorates insulin sensitivity and promotes atherosclerosis, and t9, t11-CLA prevents atherosclerosis. HYA enhances intestinal barrier function by increasing occludin expression and inhibiting intestinal inflammation in a GPR40-dependent manner. HYA inhibits atopic dermatitis by increasing claudin-1 expression and enhancing skin barrier function. HYA also inhibits gastric Helicobacter infections by blocking the bacterial futalosine pathways. </p>
