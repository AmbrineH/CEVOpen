<p class="p">Lipid composition in organisms differs among species, in accordance with the expression levels of metabolic enzymes and dietary habits. Marine phytoplankton and seaweeds produce a large amount of the ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>). In plants, linseed and perilla contain large amounts of α-linolenic acid, a precursor of EPA and DHA. In contrast, soybean oil and sesame oil contain copious quantities of the ω6-PUFA linoleic acid. The difference in the fatty acid composition of plants depends on the expression levels and activities of metabolic enzymes such as Δ12-desaturase and Δ15-desaturase, which are involved in the generation of linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, respectively (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>). Because mammals do not have either Δ12 or Δ15-desaturase, ω3- and ω6-PUFAs are categorized as essential fatty acids that must be obtained from the diet (
