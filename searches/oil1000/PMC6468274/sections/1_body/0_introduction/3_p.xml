<p class="p">Dietary lipids are metabolized not only by mammalian enzymes but also by bacterial enzymes. Microorganisms can generate unique lipid metabolites such as conjugated linoleic acids, hydroxy fatty acids, and oxo fatty acids. These bacteria-produced lipid metabolites show biological activity in the context of host health and diseases (
