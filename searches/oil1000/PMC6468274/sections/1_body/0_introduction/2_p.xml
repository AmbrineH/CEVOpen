<p class="p">The beneficial effect of dietary ω3-PUFAs on human health was first reported in an epidemiological study in 1978 in which Greenland Eskimos, who consume high ω3-PUFA diets that include fish, were found to have a lower mortality from coronary heart disease than Danes and Americans, who eat much less ω3-PUFAs (

Since then, accumulating evidence indicates that EPA and DHA have beneficial effects on the inhibition of various types of inflammatory and allergic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and food allergy (

Recent developments in analytical technology, including liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS), have enabled us to identify EPA- and DHA-derived pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), including resolvins (Rvs), protectins (PDs), maresins (MaRs), and 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EpETE) for inhibition of inflammatory and allergic diseases (
