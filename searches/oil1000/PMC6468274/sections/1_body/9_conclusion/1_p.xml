<p class="p">Recent technological developments in lipidomics research initiated a new era of lipid biology by helping researchers to identify novel lipid metabolites from ω3- and ω6-PUFAs, which actively regulate the host immune system and play important roles in the control of health and diseases. Given that the production of lipid metabolites is influenced by complex factors, including diet, intestinal bacteria, and enzyme expression, combined studies on nutrition, metabolomics, and the metagenomics of the microbiota, as well as informatics, may provide powerful insights to further our understanding of the lipid network in the host immune system.</p>
