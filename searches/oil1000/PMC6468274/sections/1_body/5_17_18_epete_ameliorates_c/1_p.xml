<p class="p">To evaluate the biological role of 17,18-EpETE in the regulation of other types of allergic inflammatory disease, we examined the effect of 17,18-EpETE on the regulation of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in the hapten-induced CHS model. We found that 17,18-EpETE showed both prophylactic and therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects on CHS in mice and cynomolgus macaques (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). Indeed, 17,18-EpETE reduced neutrophil mobility by inhibiting Rac-activation and pseudopod formation in a GPR40-dependent fashion (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). Consistent with this selective influence on neutrophils, GPR40 was highly expressed by neutrophils, but not T cells or other leukocytes in the skin. It is worth noting that mast cells do not express GPR40; so, given that mast cell degranulation was inhibited by 17,18-EpETE treatment in the food allergy model (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>), this finding suggests that 17,18-EpETE inhibits mast cell degranulation indirectly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Of note, the activation of GPR40 in intestinal epithelial cells has been reported to improve intestinal barrier function by enhancing occludin expression (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the improvement in intestinal barrier function induced by 17,18-EpETE via GPR40 in epithelial cells led to decreased allergen penetration, which, in turn, resulted in decreased mast cell degranulation and inhibited food allergy development.
