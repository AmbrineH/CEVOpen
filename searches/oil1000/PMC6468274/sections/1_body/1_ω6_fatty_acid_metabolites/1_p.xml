<p class="p">Dietary lipids are metabolized in the body to lipid mediators, which regulate host immune systems. Arachidonic acid (AA) is a metabolite of linoleic acid, and functions as a direct precursor of bioactive lipid mediators, which are known as eicosanoids. In addition to its biosynthesis in the body from linoleic acid, AA can be obtained from dietary sources, such as meat and eggs. AA is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP), and then converted into lipid mediators, including prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), thromboxanes (TXs), and lipoxins (LXs) (
