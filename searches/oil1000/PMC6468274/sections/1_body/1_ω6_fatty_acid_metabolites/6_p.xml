 <sub class="sub">2</sub> affects in its activity in pro- and anti-inflammation in croton oil-induced skin inflammation model (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). In the initial phase of the dermatitis when few inflammatory cells exist in the skin, endothelial cells show highest COX-2 activity and produce PGD
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which leads to DP activation on endothelial cells, and inhibits vascular leakage. On the other hand, in the late phase of the dermatitis, many types of hematopoietic inflammatory cells produce PGD
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which stimulate CRTH2 on inflammatory cells for infiltration to the inflamed skin, and exacerbates skin inflammation (
