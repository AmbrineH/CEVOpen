<p class="p">AA is converted into LTB
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> by LOX activity. The LTB
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-BLT1 axis plays a key role in the development of inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease by stimulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> also activates another receptor BLT2 which is a high affinity receptor for 12-hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT). In contrast to pro-inflammatory role of BLT1, BLT2-deficient mice show transepidermal water loss, suggesting its anti-inflammatory role in the skin (
