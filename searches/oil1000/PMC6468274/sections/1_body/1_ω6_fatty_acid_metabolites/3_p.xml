<p class="p">AA is converted into PGs by COX activity, which generate PGD
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and PGE
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as the representative lipid mediators. The PGD
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) pathway induces dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). Eosinophil infiltration into colon is inhibited by CRTH2 antagonist treatment in TNBS-induced colitis (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). In contrast to pro-inflammatory properties, the PGD
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-DP axis reduces granulocyte infiltration into the colonic mucosa in the mouse model of TNBS-induced colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>) These opposing roles of CRTH2 and DP in chemotaxis are explained by different usage of G proteins. CRTH2 is coupled with Gα
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> while DP is coupled with Gα
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>, which induces decreased and increased in cAMP levels, respectively (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). Consistent with these findings when PGD
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> acted on neutrophils CRTH2 pathway, it induced neutrophil migration to the intestinal lamina propria in the DSS-induced colitis model (
