<p class="p">Examples of how SPMs affect intestinal inflammation include their involvement in the RvE1–ChemR23 axis, which actively inhibits colonic inflammation in the DSS-induced colitis model by suppressing the TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-12p40, from macrophages (
