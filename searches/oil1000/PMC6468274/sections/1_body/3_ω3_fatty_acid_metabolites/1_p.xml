<p class="p">EPA and DHA are representative ω3-PUFAs, which compete with AA in the AA cascade. Therefore, it has long been considered that the beneficial effects of dietary ω3-PUFAs against inflammatory diseases stem from decreased amounts of AA-derived eicosanoids. In addition, recent technology developments in LC and MS have led to the identification of trace and novel lipid mediators, including Rvs, PDs, and MaRs, which are produced from EPA and DHA in the body (

For example, Rvs derived from EPA and DHA use distinct types of receptors. RvE1 interacts with BLT1 and ChemR23, while RvD1 interacts with G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 32 and ALX (
