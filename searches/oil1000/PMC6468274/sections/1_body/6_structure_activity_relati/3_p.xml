<p class="p">CYP is also found in microorganisms. For example, it has been reported that bacterial CYP (e.g., BM-3 derived from 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus megateirum</italic>) metabolizes PUFAs and produces hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids (

 <italic class="italic">Bacillus, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Mycobacterium</italic> also have CYP (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>–
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>). These findings suggest that many types of microorganisms are involved in lipid metabolism. In addition, other metabolic enzymes, such as COX and LOX, are thought to be expressed by some bacteria, including 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shewanella woodyi, Mytococcus fulrus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>). Some microorganisms described above are present in environment, suggesting that in addition to mammalian expression of metabolic enzymes, various microorganisms may be a determinant of the efficacy of ω3-PUFA in the context of the regulation of inflammation.
