<p class="p">17,18-EpETE is further metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase to 17,18-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-diHETE). However, 17,18-diHETE has little effect on the development of food allergy, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (14,15-EpETE), which has an epoxy structure at the ω6 position, also lacks the ability to inhibit food allergy (
