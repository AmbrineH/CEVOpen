<p class="p">Linseed oil contains large amount of α-linolenic acid, which is converted into EPA and DHA in the body. One study reported that linseed oil-fed mice alleviated pollen-induced allergic conjunctivitis by decreasing the production of ω6-PUFA-derived pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, and reducing eosinophil infiltration into the conjunctiva (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). In this model, allergic diarrhea occurs as a consequence of a dominant Th2-type environment and the presence of allergen-specific serum IgE, which induces mast cell degranulation in the gut. We found that in linseed oil-fed mice, the Th1–Th2 balance, allergen-specific IgE level, and mast cell numbers in the gut did not change compared with those in soybean oil-fed mice in the OVA-induced food allergy model. However, we found that mast cell degranulation was profoundly inhibited in linseed oil-fed mice (
