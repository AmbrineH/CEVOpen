<p class="p">Fish oil is a representative ω3-PUFA-rich dietary oil which contains plenty amount of EPA and DHA. Dietary fish oil ameliorated asthma by decreasing eosinophil infiltration, mucus production, and peribronchiolar fibrosis, which was associated with inhibition of cytokine production by downregulation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and GATA-3 (
