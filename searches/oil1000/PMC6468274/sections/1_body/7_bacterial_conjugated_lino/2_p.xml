<p class="p">For example, 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>9,
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>11-CLA shows beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake and adipokine production such as leptin and adiponectin, and on atherosclerosis by suppressing macrophage infiltration and activation, and reducing plaque development through an increase in expression of PPARγ, while 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>10,c12-CLA shows adverse effects through a decrease in expression of PPARγ (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>10,c12-CLA reduces expression of liver X receptor α (LXRα) which induces expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A1, ABCG1, and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c which involved in reverse cholesterol transport (

 <italic class="italic">t</italic>10,c12-CLA shows pro-atherosclerosis effects (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>–

 <italic class="italic">t</italic>11-CLA is effective for the treatment of atherosclerosis by activation of LXRα (
