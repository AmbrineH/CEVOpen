<p class="p">The production of these hydroxy and oxo fatty acids depends on the unique bacterial enzymes CLA-HY (unsaturated fatty acid hydratase), CLA-DH (hydroxy fatty acid dehydrogenase), CLA-DC (isomerase), and CLA-ER (enone reductase) in

 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> but also in a broad spectrum of bacteria. Oleate hydratase belongs to the FAD-dependent myosin cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) protein family, which is found in gram-positive and -negative bacteria; it catalyzes the conversion of linoleic acid to HYA. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Stenotrophomonas</italic> bacteria are reported to have MCRA, and indeed they have the ability to produce HYA (
