 <p id="Par1" class="p">The ability to tune and enhance the properties of luminescent materials is essential for enlarging their application potential. Recently, the modulation of the photoluminescence emission of lanthanide-doped ferroelectric perovskites by applying an electric field has been reported. Herein, we show that the ferroelectric order and, more generally the polar order, has a direct effect on the photoluminescence of Eu
  <sup class="sup">3+</sup> in the model BaZr
  <sub class="sub">x</sub>Ti
  <sub class="sub">1−x</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> perovskite even in the absence of an external field. The dipole arrangement evolves with increasing 
  <italic class="italic">x</italic> from long-range ferroelectric order to short-range order typical of relaxors until the non-polar paraelectric BaZrO
  <sub class="sub">3</sub> is achieved. The cooperative polar interactions existing in the lattice (
  <italic class="italic">x</italic> &lt; 1) promote the off-center displacement of the Eu
  <sup class="sup">3+</sup> ion determining a change of the lanthanide site symmetry and, consequently, an abrupt variation of the photoluminescence emission with temperature. Each type of polar order is characterized by a distinct photoluminescence behaviour.
