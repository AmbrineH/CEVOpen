 <p> ( a) schematic representation of the stability range of the different crystal phases or polar variants in the Ba 1−yEu yZr xTi 1−x−y/4O 3 and Ba 1−yEu yZr 1−y/4O 3 ( y = 0.01; x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70) ceramics. The drawings serve only as a quick eye guide to correlate structure and polar order with luminescence properties. Labels: C-P = cubic-paraelectric; C-R = cubic-relaxor; R-FE, O-FE, and T-FE = ferroelectric materials having rhombohedral, orthorhombic or tetragonal structure, respectively. Photoluminescence spectra of Eu:BZT ceramics at ( b) room temperature, ( c) −20 °C and ( d) −100 °C. The curves color in panels (b-d) denotes the crystal phase and polar order according to panel (a). The numbers in panels b), c) and d) label the 5D 0 → 7F J (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) Eu 3+ transitions. </p>
