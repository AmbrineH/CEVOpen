<p id="Par43" class="p">HR spectra and temperature dependent experiments (−100–140 °C) were carried out in backscattering geometry using a Horiba T64000 triple spectrometer equipped with a Peltier-cooled charge-coupled device detector (Horiba Synapse). The scattered radiation was collected through a 10× microscope objective (Olympus MPLAN, 10×/0.25). The spectrograph, equipped with 2400 lines/mm gratings for high resolution and 300 lines/mm for temperature dependent experiments, was used as a single stage spectrograph. Temperature dependent experiments were performed by means of a Linkam THMS600 heating/freezing microscope stage having temperature stability &lt;0.1 °C over −196 °C to 600 °C temperature range.</p>
