<p id="Par42" class="p">Room temperature luminescence spectra were recorded on solid samples in a front-face acquisition geometry with a spectrofluorimeter (Fluorolog-3, Horiba JobinYvon) equipped with double-grating monochromator in both the excitation and emission sides, coupled to a R928P Hamamatsu photomultiplier and a 450â€‰W Xe arc lamp as the excitation source. The emission spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral response of the spectrofluorimeter supplied by the manufacturer.</p>
