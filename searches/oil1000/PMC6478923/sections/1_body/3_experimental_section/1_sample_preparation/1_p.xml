 </sup> the solubility limit of trivalent europium. The low dopant concentration adopted (1 mol.%) guarantees that the structural and physical properties of the materials are not significantly affected. Precursor powders were wet-mixed in polypropylene jars using water as liquid and a solution of ammonium polyacrylate (pH = 10) as dispersant. After drying, the mixed powder was calcined for 4 h at 1000 °C and then compacted in cylinders (length: 1 cm, diameter: 1 cm) by isostatic pressing at 1500 bar. The resulting greens were sintered in air for 4 h at different temperatures depending on composition: 1450 °C (BZ0-BZ30), 1550 °C (BZ50-BZ70) and 1600 °C (BZ100). The relative density of the final samples was determined by the Archimedes’ method. The ceramics are well densified with relative density ≥94%. Ceramic disks with a thickness of about 1 mm were cut from the sintered body and characterized by different techniques.
