<p id="Par41" class="p">The phase composition and crystal structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a CubiX diffractometer (Panalytical, The Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (30 kV, 30 mA). The lattice parameters were determined using FullProf 2000. For dielectric measurements, Ag-Pd electrodes were deposited on the plane-parallel polished surfaces of the disks followed by annealing in air at 500 °C for 12 h. The dielectric properties were measured by an impedance bridge E4980A Precision LCR Meter (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and a dielectric spectrometer CONCEPT40 (Novocontrol Technologies, Hundsangen, Germany) in the temperature range −150–150 °C at 10
