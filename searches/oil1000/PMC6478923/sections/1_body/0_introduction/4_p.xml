 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> was chosen as a dopant because of the well-known bright emissions and for its powerful ability to act as a spectroscopic local probe for the determination of the symmetry of the first coordination sphere of a lanthanide ion in organometallic molecules and crystals

 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> has an ionic radius (c.n. 12) of 1.226 Å and, therefore, its crystallo chemical behavior can be considered as representative of other trivalent lanthanide ions with intermediate size, from Sm
