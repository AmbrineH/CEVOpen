 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>) displays a typical relaxor behavior: the temperature corresponding to the maximum permittivity shifts at higher temperatures with increasing frequency. The permittivity maximum no longer corresponds to a phase transition but is determined by the relaxation dynamics of the PNRs

 </sup> indicates that the dielectric properties of the Eu-doped samples are rather similar to those reported for BZT materials likely due to the low concentration of the dopant. The phase transition temperatures of ferroelectric samples are very close (within a few degrees) to those of the undoped ceramics.
