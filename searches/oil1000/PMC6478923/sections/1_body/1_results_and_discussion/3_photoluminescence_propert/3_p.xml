<p id="Par14" class="p">To verify the absence in the emission spectra of contributions coming from interface/foreign sites, sample BZ0 was annealed at 1450 °C for 48 h. This prolonged thermal treatment determined the exaggerated growth of some grains up to a size of 300–400 μm, thus allowing the intrinsic luminescence of Eu

 <sub class="sub">7</sub>) and/or glassy phase films at grain boundaries, if any. Exaggerated grain growth during prolonged sintering is quite common in pure and slightly doped BaTiO
