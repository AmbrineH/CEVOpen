 </sup>, the Ti ions in the paraelectric cubic phase exhibit off-center local displacement along the eight [111] directions but the average polarization is null because of the random distribution among the 8 split sites. Below the Curie temperature partial ordering occurs. Thus O, T and C long-range structures are the result of the averaging [111] displacements of octahedral Ti over 2, 4 and 8 local rhombohedral directions, respectively. Only for the rhombohedral phase the local and long-range structures are equivalent. It is worth noting that the deformation of the R phase with respect to the cubic unit cell is quite small. At −93 °C the rhombohedral angle α is 89.85°
