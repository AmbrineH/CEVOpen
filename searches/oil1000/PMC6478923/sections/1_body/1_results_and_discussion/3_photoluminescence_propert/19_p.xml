<p id="Par30" class="p">From a purely geometric point of view, the volume (5.34 Å
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) of the pyramidal cavity available to host Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> when moving along the [100] and [110] directions is twice that of the space available in the [111] direction and, consequently, this latter option is less likely. It is worth noting that no displacement would be expected if Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> were incorporated at the Ti/Zr site, as its ionic radius in octahedral coordination (0.947 Å) is exceedingly large. The geometry depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref> is only a first approximation as the oxygen ions around Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> will undergo some relaxation from their ideal positions.
