<p id="Par15" class="p">PL spectra collected by means of a microscope on a polished cross-section at the center of a large grain and on the fine-grained matrix (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) are virtually identical. Therefore, the non-equivalent Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> sites are associated with the perovskite lattice. Although the ionic radius of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> in octahedral coordination (0.947 Å) is rather large and the stoichiometry was designed for exclusive Ba-site substitution, a small amount of the rare-earth could be incorporated at the B site. The probability of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> incorporation in perovskite B-site increases with increasing Zr content, as the unit cell volume expands of about 15% moving from BaTiO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to BaZrO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Alternative and complementary explanations for the existence of multiple sites will be discussed further on studying the emission spectra as a function of temperature.
