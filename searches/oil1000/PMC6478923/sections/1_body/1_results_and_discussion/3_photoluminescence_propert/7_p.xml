 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F

 <sup class="sup">5</sup>D
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> → 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> one, have a much lower intensity. The 
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>D
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> → 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> transition is the strongest even in sample BZ30 in comparison to RT. The spectra of BZ50, BZ70 and BZ100 are instead very similar to those observed at room temperature. At −100 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>), the 
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>D
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> → 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> transition is the most intense for all ceramics except BZ100, for which it has the same order of magnitude as 
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>D
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> → 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and 
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>D
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> → 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. No significant changes in the shape of PL spectra of ferroelectric ceramics are observed between −20 and −100 °C. It is worth noting that band broadening in the PL spectra of relaxors is unaffected by temperature variations.
