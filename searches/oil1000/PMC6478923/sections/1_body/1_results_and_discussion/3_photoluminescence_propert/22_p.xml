<p id="Par33" class="p">Following the same reasoning, the additional driving force determining off-centering of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> in ferroelectric ceramics is the enhancement of polar order and ferroelectricity resulting from the correlated movement of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> and Ti
 <sup class="sup">4+</sup> ions. The off-center displacement of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> will give rise to an electrical dipole. If Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> preferentially moves along one of the [100] directions in such a way that the component of the associated dipole moment will positively contribute to the dipole moment corresponding to the [111] relaxation of the Ti ions, the europium displacement will concur to the overall polarization and ferroelectricity. This mechanism can be amplified by the deformation of the TiO
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> octahedra nearest to Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> as happens with Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>. Opposite, if Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> moved randomly, there would be no net contribution to ferroelectricity and no extra energy gain determined by off-centering. Hence, the absence of polar order in BaZrO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> prevents a correlated displacement of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> and Zr
 <sup class="sup">4+</sup> and the lanthanide will largely stay in central position. It should be kept in mind that the concentration of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> ions is as low as 1% and, consequently, their mutual interaction will be negligible thus hampering a cooperative behavior of the lanthanide ions alone.
