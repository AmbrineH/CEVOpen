<p id="Par34" class="p">The evolution of the PL spectra with temperature is mainly ascribed to the change of the population of the different Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> sites. For ferroelectric ceramics, the off-centering of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> occurs over a broad temperature range (up to 60–80 °C for BaTiO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) by the cooperative polar interactions discussed above and made possible by the existence of ferroelectric order. The polar interactions counteract the thermal motion which would favor the occupation of the central sites or more disordered distributions. In the absence of polar interactions, as in BaZrO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, off-centering of some Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> can only occur at low temperature (≤−80 °C), as indicated by the increasing contribution of the 
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>D
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> → 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> transition to the overall emission (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), thanks to the reduced thermal motion. In relaxors (BZ30, BZ50, BZ70), Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> off-center displacement should be confined within PNRs, whereas a behavior similar to that exhibited by BaZrO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is expected in the paraelectric matrix. However, the PL spectra of BZ30 below −40 °C are very similar to those of the ferroelectric samples (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). This observation supports the idea that the ferroelectric to relaxor crossover in BaZr
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>Ti
 <sub class="sub">1−x</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> occurs over the composition range 0.25 ≤ x &lt; 0.35 with coexistence of PNRs and ferroelectric domains, the latter originated by percolation of polar clusters on cooling

 </sup>. The rapid increase of the 
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>D
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> → 
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>F
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission at lower temperature in the other two relaxors (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) is again attributed to the suppression of thermal motion and off-centering of some Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> ions.
