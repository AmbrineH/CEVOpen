<p id="Par35" class="p">One can wonder if the evolution of the PL spectra with temperature might be determined by a change of defect chemistry, for example by a redistribution of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> ions between A and B sites in the perovskite. However, owing to the very low mobility of cation and oxygen vacancies in the investigated temperature range, the defect chemistry of BaTiO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and BaZrO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is essentially frozen. Oxygen vacancies, the most mobile kind of ionic defects, start to be mobile above 400 °C

 </sup>. A change in the distribution of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> between Ba and Ti sites is unlikely because this would imply a complete re-equilibration of the bulk defect chemistry and in particular the concentration of the charge compensating defects (cation vacancies for Ba-site incorporation, oxygen vacancies for B-site substitution) which can only occur by long-range diffusional transport. In contrast, the change of the Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> position from the center of the dodecahedron to a nearby acentric site occurs over a very short distance (≈1 Å) and does not require diffusion.
