<p id="Par11" class="p">The splitting of the (200) peak in the XRD pattern of the BZ0 ceramic (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Supporting Information) indicates a typical 
 <italic class="italic">P4/mm</italic> tetragonal structure and the refinement gives a c/a ratio of the lattice parameters of 1.0096, only slightly smaller than that of undoped BaTiO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (1.0109). The unit cell volume, 64.35 Å
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, is virtually the same of undoped barium titanate (64.34 Å
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) being the difference within the experimental error. Although peak splitting is no longer observed, the broadening of some lines (compare the 111 and 200 peaks) indicates a non-cubic structure for BZ5 (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Supporting Information), in agreement with the existence of long-range ferroelectric order at room temperature. The assignment of the crystal symmetry is not straightforward given the absence of splitting. Refinement with 
 <italic class="italic">P4mm</italic> tetragonal structure with a lower c/a ratio of 1.0041 results in a marginally better fit than orthorhombic 
 <italic class="italic">Pbnm</italic> structure. XRD pattern of BZ15 indicates a cubic 
 <italic class="italic">Pm-3m</italic> symmetry (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) though this composition is expected to be ferroelectric at room temperature as indicated by the dielectric measurements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). This apparent discrepancy is determined by the proximity of the phase transition (

 </sub> = 50 °C) and, consequently, the small deviation of the polar structure from the cubic arrangement not detectable with a conventional diffractometer. The ceramics with 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 0.30, 0.50 and 0.70 show the cubic 
 <italic class="italic">Pm-3m</italic> structure, as expected from their relaxor nature. Relaxors possess an average cubic structure but their local symmetry is lower and characterized by the existence of PNRs with short-range polar order. The unit cell volume increases linearly with 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Supporting Information) as a result of the larger ionic radius of Zr
 <sup class="sup">4+</sup> (0.720 Å, c.n. 6) in comparison to Ti
 <sup class="sup">4+</sup> (0.605 Å, c.n. 6). The unit cell volume of the ceramic with x = 1 is 73.71 Å
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> to be compared with 73.83 Å
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of undoped BaZrO
