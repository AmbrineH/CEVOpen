<p id="Par39" class="p">It is expected that other RE
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> ions with intermediate size (Sm
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> to Er
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup>), when incorporated at the Ba site of the perovskite, can exhibit a behavior similar to that of Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> as the underlying mechanism is rather general and not restricted to a specific ion. However, the magnitude of the off-center displacement is likely to depend on the ionic radius of the dopant producing a systematic trend. Furthermore, a ferroelectric/polar order control of photoluminescence could be observed in other perovskites.
