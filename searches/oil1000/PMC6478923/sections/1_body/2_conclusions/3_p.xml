 <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 0.30–0.70 have a short-range polar order typical of relaxors and their photoluminescence shows a distinct crossover but a more complex behavior. The complexity partly arises from the heterogeneous nature of the relaxors at the nanoscale, corresponding to BaTiO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> polar nanoregions embedded in a paraelectric matrix. Moreover, for these intermediate compositions several Eu
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> sites corresponding to a different number of ZrO
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> (TiO
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>) octahedra surrounding the lanthanide will give a significant contribution to the luminescence.
