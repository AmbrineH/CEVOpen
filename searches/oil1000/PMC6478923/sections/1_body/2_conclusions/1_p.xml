<p id="Par36" class="p">An effective tuning of the photoluminescence of rare-earth ions incorporated in ferroelectric perovskites has recently been achieved by exploiting the strong coupling between the lattice strain and the electric field (or the mechanical stress) typical of ferroelectric materials. However, as shown in the present paper, the polar order and, in particular, the ferroelectric order, has a direct and remarkable impact on the photoluminescence of Eu
