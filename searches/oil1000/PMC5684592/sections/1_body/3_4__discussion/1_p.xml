<p class="p">Since weight loaded swimming is an ideal experimental model to evaluate the antifatigue capacity [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], the length of time to swim to exhaustion indicates the degree of fatigue [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows that the time to exhaustion for rats in the fatigue group was significantly shorter than for those in the control group, indicating that the model was valid. EOM treatment remarkably prolonged the time to exhaustion in rats compared with the other three groups, suggesting that EOM has antifatigue effects superior to those of PEO.
