<p class="p">In conclusion, our results suggested that the inhalation of the essential oils of
 <italic class="italic"> Citrus sinensis</italic> L.,
 <italic class="italic"> Mentha piperita</italic> L.,
 <italic class="italic"> Syzygium aromaticum</italic> L., and
 <italic class="italic"> Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. could powerfully relieve exercise-induced fatigue and the antiphysical fatigue effect of the inhaled EOM was better than that of peppermint essential oil. The putative antifatigue mechanism is the inhibition of the production and accumulation of metabolites, indicated by the reduction of the BUN and BLA in the present study, the decreased depletion of the energy source, indicated by the reduction of glucose depletion, and the protection of the cell structure from attack and damage after exercising to exhaustion by the high antioxidant activity, as indicated by the enhanced activity of the antioxidant enzymes. The results provide an experimental basis for developing a new sort of natural antifatigue spray. They also indicate that the EOM could be used to achieve antiphysical fatigue effects by sniffing. However, further study is needed to clarify the antifatigue mechanism at the cellular and molecular level.
