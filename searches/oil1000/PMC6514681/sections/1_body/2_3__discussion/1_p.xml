<p class="p">The chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. leticianum</italic> essential oils was studied for the first time in this research. The main molecules in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aspera</italic> essential oil were germacrene D (23.2%), bicyclogermacrene (7.8%) and α-pinene (7.0%). In a previously study we found germacrene D and bicyclogermacrene as major compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">Siparuna schimpffi</italic> spice [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and α-pinene as a minor component. For 
 <italic class="italic">S. macrotepala</italic>, the presence of cadinane compounds in interesting amounts was evidenced [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], not revealed in our essential oil. 
 <italic class="italic">P. leticianum</italic> essential oil showed β-caryophyllene (21.8%) and germacrene D (9.0%) as main compounds, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. augustum</italic> essential oil had a similar composition. Studies of other Piperaceae family species, like 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">P. marginatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">P. cernuum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], highlighted a high β-caryophyllene content. Research on 
 <italic class="italic">P. augustum</italic> essential oil confirmed β-caryophyllene as the main molecule [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Numerous studies in the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">H. coronarium</italic> rhizomes reported very similar chemical compositions, with 1,8-cineole and β-pinene as main components [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], with exception of the data reported by Prakash et al. where linalool and limonene were the principal molecules [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The antioxidant activities of the essential oils were not comparable with the positive control, 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil. However, it is important to note the interesting radical scavenging effect of germacrene D, isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">S. macrotepala</italic> essential oil, with a DPPH IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 2.1 mg/mL and ABTS IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 1.1 mg/mL, also shown through the HPTLC bioautographic test. Photochemiluminescence assays confirmed the low antioxidant activity of the essential oils compared to the positive control. Finally, we studied the antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria and yeasts. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">H. coronarium</italic> showed an interesting antimicrobial effect vs. 
 <italic class="italic">L. grayi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">K. oxytoca</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and the literature has documented good results for an essential oil with similar composition against 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Other paper studied the antimicrobial activity, but the chemical composition was different from our essential oil [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] or the chemical characterization was not investigated [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">P. augustum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. leticianum</italic> highlighted interesting results against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans.</italic> The antimicrobial bioautographic assay of 
 <italic class="italic">H. coronarium</italic> essential oil on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, chosen as model for this experimental approach, showed that 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol were the molecules responsible for the activity. Some studies have highlighted the appreciable antimicrobial capacity of these molecules [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>].
