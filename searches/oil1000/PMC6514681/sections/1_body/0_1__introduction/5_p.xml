<p class="p">One of the objectives of the present investigation is to reach a chemical characterization of the essential oils of the five Amazonian species; especially for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. leticianum</italic>, whose chemical composition was never previously described. A second objective is related to the evaluation of in vitro biological activity, performing antimicrobial and antioxidant activity studies. The research described in this manuscript ultimately is driven by the need to valorize the biodiversity and the knowledge of the native peoples of Ecuador, for their own benefits based on sustainable exploitation and in general for the advantage of the Ecuadorian population. Some of these medicinal plants could be used as an alternative health products to synthetic medicines, whose economic benefits generally fall to transnational pharmaceutical corporations.
