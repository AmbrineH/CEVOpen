<p class="p">Our research has focused on the chemical characterization and biological activity of five essential oils. In particular we studied for the first time the composition of two essential oils from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. leticianum</italic>, thus contributing to increasing the information about chemo-biodiversity in Ecuador. A second positive result arose from a performed antimicrobial evaluation, where 
 <italic class="italic">H. coronarium</italic> has been proven as the most interesting essential oil: 
 <italic class="italic">P. augustum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. leticianum</italic> showed a high effect on 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and all of them could be proposed as anticaries agenta, in agreement with their ancestral use [

Finally, it can be concluded that the valorization of these five species could in the near future become an alternative source of development funds for the communities that inhabit the Kutuku mountain range, as well as a starting point to investigate other species and evaluate various other types of applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food fields.
