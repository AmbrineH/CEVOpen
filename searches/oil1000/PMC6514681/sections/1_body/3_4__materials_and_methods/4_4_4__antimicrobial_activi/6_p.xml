<p class="p">Bioactivity against the yeasts was also processed. Mother cultures were set up inoculating 100 mL Yeast Extract and Potato Dextrose (YEPD) liquid medium in 250 sterile flasks and for each mother culture at the stationary phase of growth, broth dilutions were made to obtain a strain concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL to inoculate Petri dishes with agarized YEPD for bioassays. Then, 10 μL of DMSO-essential oil sample solutions were prepared in order to have an assay range 0.55–500 mg/mL, and then deposited on sterile paper disk (6 mm diameter, Difco). The Petri dishes were successively incubated at 30 °C in the dark and checked for evaluating the growth inhibition after 48 h, both for bacteria and yeasts streams: the lowest concentration of each essential oil showing a clear zone of inhibition was taken as the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Negative controls were set up with 10 μL of DMSO in the test solution, while positive ones were assessed with
