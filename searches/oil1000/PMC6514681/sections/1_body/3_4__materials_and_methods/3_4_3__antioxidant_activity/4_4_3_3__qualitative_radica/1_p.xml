<p class="p">Bioautographic high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) is an assay of antiradical activity that uses the DPPH and ABTS radicals to reveal the activity of the separate compounds or fractions in a complex mixture [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01637" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. For the test, 30 μL of each essential oil was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol. 15 μL of these solutions were then applied directly to a Merck 60 HPTLC silica gel plate (Darmstadt, Germany), with F 254 fluorescence indicator, with a Camag LinomatV instrument (Muttenz, Switzerland). The mobile phase was
