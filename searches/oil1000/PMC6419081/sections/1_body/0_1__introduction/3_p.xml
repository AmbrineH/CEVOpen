<p class="p">In the present study, we have investigated the secondary structure and properties of a protein material produced from ground defatted plasticized BSF larvae, especially its interactions with water/moisture. This is the first study using whole defatted larvae for plastic material production. The biggest hurdle for replacing oil-based plastics with protein materials is their moisture sensitivity. It dictates to a large extent the protein material properties [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. It is thus important to investigate these interactions in detail for new candidates. The protein secondary structure is also important to reveal since it does also dictate to a large extent the material properties.
