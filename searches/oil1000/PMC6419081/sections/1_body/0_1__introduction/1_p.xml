 <sub class="sub">2</sub> generation, the burning of oil-based plastics also contributes. Replacing commodity thermoplastics with corn-based bioplastics, which is one of the most realistic options in the near future, can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 25% [

 <xref rid="B5-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. A hitherto unexplored animal source for plastic production is larvae biomass. Larvae of the Black Soldier fly (BSF) (

 <xref rid="B14-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Because of their high concentration of lipid and proteins with essential amino acids, BSF larvae have been considered as feed for animals [

Since the BSF larvae contain a large amount of protein, it is interesting to see whether it is possible to produce materials from the whole larvae. Whereas the production of many bio-based materials (e.g., poly(lactic acid), thermoplastic starch, sugarcane polyethylene and soy protein) may compete with the production of human food [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], protein materials from larvae grown on food waste do not.
