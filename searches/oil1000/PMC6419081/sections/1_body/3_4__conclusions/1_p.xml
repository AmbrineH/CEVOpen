<p class="p">It has been shown here that it is possible to make a protein-based material by compression molding defatted larvae of the Black Soldier fly. This is a viable option, especially if the converted biomass cannot be used for animal feed due to polluted larvae. The conversion of food and organic waste to protein material through larvae is probably also a more economically/commercially interesting option than producing animal feed, since these materials are in general higher value products. There is also an interesting byproduct in the large amount of lipid extracted during the production of the protein material, which may find a use in bio-lubricants and biofuel. IR spectroscopy showed the presence of a highly aggregated structure and the behavior of the material in moist environments has also been investigated. Moisture is almost always a critical factor for the applications of protein materials, and it is therefore important to clarify the interactions between the material and moisture. The protein material with a glycerol plasticizer is highly hydrophilic, as shown by the large amount of the material extracted in water and the high moisture uptake shown by the sorption isotherm. In future work, the mechanical properties of the protein material under moist conditions is intended be investigated. Based on the results of this work, it is clear that the type of protein material investigated here can only find use in drier climates/indoor applications, separated from liquid water, or in applications where the material is in contact with fatty substances. Possible future applications could be as covers of lamps, covers of electrical parts/switches and disposable plastic products.</p>
