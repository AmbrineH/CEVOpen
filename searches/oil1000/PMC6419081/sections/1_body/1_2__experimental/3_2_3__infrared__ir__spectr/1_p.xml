<p class="p">The sample, dried for at least two days in a desiccator with silica gel, was investigated using a Perkin-Elmer Spotlight 400 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging system equipped with a germanium attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal. The IR absorption spectrum was recorded in the ATR image mode in the regions 750 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 4000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> based on 16 scans and a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The IR spectrum was resolved into nine Gaussian peaks in the amide I band (1587 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 1700 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) using fixed peak positions, and assignments of these according to Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Before the peak fitting, the raw IR data was first deconvoluted using an enhancement factor (γ) of 2 and a smoothing filter of 70%. The first fit was the total amide I absorbance, which included the absorbance from the amide in the chitin. The total amide I absorbance spectrum was then reduced in size with respect to the measured chitin absorbance spectrum (not shown), assuming that the absorbance was a linear function of the mass content of the different components (protein, chitin) in the material. A new peak fitting was performed on the reduced spectrum starting with the fitted parameters from the total amide I spectrum.
