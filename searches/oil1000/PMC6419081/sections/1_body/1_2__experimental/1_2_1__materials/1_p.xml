<p class="p">The larvae used for material production were obtained in a fly larva composting unit [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The larvae were fed with a combination of pig manure, dog food (Puppy Original, Pro Plan, Purina) and human feces (4:4:2 in weight, 28.7 ± 1.2 total solids) [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The larvae at the sixth instar (pre-pupae) were separated from the compost and placed in plastic bags in a freezer at −25 °C during at least one week for inactivation, dried at 105 °C for 14 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature and stored at ambient water conditions (larva moisture content: ~10 wt.%). The whole larvae (ca. 100 g) were cryo-ground using a Retsch 5657 HAAN grinder (Germany). The lipid was extracted by adding five parts n-hexane to one part larva powder (20 g/4 g). The mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 60 °C for 3 h and then centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm, after which the supernatant (n-hexane and dissolved lipid) was decanted. The defatted powder was then left in an oven at 60 °C overnight to ensure that the remaining n-hexane evaporated. After drying, the powder was mixed manually with the glycerol plasticizer (70/30

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00287-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The heating was then stopped, and the sample was cooled to room temperature without releasing the pressure. The thinnest samples were used in the present study in order to obtain reasonably short measurement times in the Dynamic Vapor Sorption equipment. Different procedures for making the material were tested, including an n-hexane/powder ratio of 3/1 and two-step centrifugation, but the procedure given above was found to be the best with respect to removing most of the lipid efficiently while limiting the number of processing steps.
