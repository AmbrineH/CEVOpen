 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00287-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. As expected, the plasticizing effect of water led to an increase in the water diffusivity with increasing water activity. However, beyond a water activity of 0.35–0.4, the diffusivity decreased due to increasing water clustering. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00287-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, the diffusivity data are also given for the wheat gluten material with a similar glycerol content. A peak in diffusivity was also observed, but it occurred at a significantly higher water activity than for the larva material, despite the similarity in the 
 <italic class="italic">MCS</italic>–water activity data. Roy et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] reported that the water diffusivity increased monotonically over the measured relative humidity range (6–80%) for a cast wheat gluten film with a glycerol content similar to that of the larva material. The water diffusivity–activity relationship is evidently sensitive to how the materials are produced. It is clear, however, that in the two wheat gluten materials referred to here, the water diffusivity was higher than that of the larva material, regardless of the actual water activity. Protein materials suffer from changes in mechanical properties during variations in the relative humidity. It is therefore beneficial to have a lower water diffusivity since the response to a change in relative humidity will be slower and property changes will smoothen out over time to a greater extent.
