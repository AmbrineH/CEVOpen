 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00287-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the mass change and heat flow during heating in both air and nitrogen are shown. The loss in mass up to ca. 100 °C is due to evaporating water and further on the evaporation of glycerol (endothermal processes). Beyond ca. 200 °C, the net heat flow is exothermal and due to material degradation (oxidation in air and pyrolysis in nitrogen). The residual char at 800 °C is, as expected, higher in the pyrolysis case than in the case of oxidation. However, it is interesting to note that in both cases, the residual char is substantial. This is beneficial when it comes to the flame retarding properties of plastics.
