<p class="p">The conformational structure of the protein was determined with IR spectroscopy. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00287-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the protein absorbance in the Amide I region after subtraction of the chitin absorbance in the same region. The positions and origins of the nine resolved peaks after deconvolution and fitting are given in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00287-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The content of strongly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets was 44% (peaks 1 and 2), which is indicative of a large amount of aggregated protein. It is similar to a highly aggregated wheat gluten sample (42.2%) with the same glycerol content that has undergone an injection molding cycle at high temperature (180 °C) (
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00287-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The content of α-helices and unordered proteins (peaks 4 to 6) was 33%, higher than that of the wheat gluten material (21%). The content of weakly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets (peaks 3 and 8, not specifically associated with highly aggregated protein) was 7%, lower than that of the wheat gluten material (12%). Finally, the content of β-turns (peaks 7 and 9) was lowest for the larva protein (16%, wheat gluten: 25%). A highly aggregated protein usually means a protein with high cohesion. However, this is also a matter of the purity of the protein material. The present material did not have the cohesion expected from the high aggregation, which is due to, as in the case reported for rapeseed flour/cake materials [
 <xref rid="B43-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], the lower protein purity. Despite the defatting, a further purification step is needed for improved cohesion or, alternatively, a crosslinking of the protein component. However, every purification step will increase the price of the material so there is a trade-off regarding protein purity.
