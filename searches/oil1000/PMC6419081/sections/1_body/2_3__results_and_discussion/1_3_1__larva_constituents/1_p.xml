<p class="p">The raw protein content of the larvae was 43.5 ± 1.6 wt.% of the dry mass according to Kjeldahl (N × 6.25, NMKL 6:2003). The sum of the contents of each amino acid yielded a protein content of 39.2 ± 2 wt.%. The difference, 4.3%, was considered to be due to chitin [
 <xref rid="B41-polymers-11-00287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The amino acids with the highest content were the essential amino acids aspartic acid/asparagine and glutamic acid/glutamine, each amounting to ca. 10 wt.% of the total amino acid content (

Other amino acids present in larger amounts were the non-essential amino acid tyrosine (9 wt.%) and the essential amino acids leucin, lysine and valine (~7 wt.% each). The content of the sulfur-containing and disulfide forming cystine/cysteine was less than 1 wt.%.
