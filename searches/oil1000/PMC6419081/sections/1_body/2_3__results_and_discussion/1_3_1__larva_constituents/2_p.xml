These values are similar to those reported earlier on pre-pupae oil despite feeding the larvae with a different source (70 wt.%, 15 wt.% and 12.5 wt.%). As previously reported for the pre-pupae oil, the main fatty acids were lauric (48 wt.% of the total fatty acid content), palmitic (14 wt.%), oleic (13 wt.%), linoleic (8 wt.%) and myristic acid (7 wt.%) (
