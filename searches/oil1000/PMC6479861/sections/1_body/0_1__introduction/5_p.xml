<p class="p">In the field of food chemistry, simultaneous ultrasound/microwave is often used to extract natural products. In contrast, alternating ultrasound/microwave extraction technology has rarely been reported [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, the efficiency of synergetic ultrasound/microwave extraction is not necessarily better than that of alternating ultrasound/microwave digestion, and the extraction efficiency of natural products is greatly influenced by combining extraction modes in an alternating fashion [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Therefore, this work aimed to develop an alternating ultrasound/microwave extraction method with DES that simultaneously extracts higher yields of polysaccharides and essential oils to study the optimal combination of alternating ultrasound/microwave extraction methods, and analyzed its mechanism. The extraction mechanisms of the alternating ultrasound/microwave methods are also explained in detail. After deproteinization, free radical scavenging activity and cell proliferation of the polysaccharides, the antioxidant activities of the essential oils were investigated [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. This also demonstrates that
