<p class="p">Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a sustainable alternative to ionic liquids derived from green natural and renewable components. Compared with the traditional extraction methods, DES pretreatment can enhance digestibility, reduce energy consumption, and simplify procedures for solvent recovery. DES can be formed by mixing simple quaternary ammonium salt such as choline chloride (ChCl) with appropriate Hydrogen Bond Donor (HBD) (such as metal halides, acids and alcohols) under heating [
