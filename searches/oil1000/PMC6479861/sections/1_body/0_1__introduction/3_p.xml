<p class="p">Alternate ultrasound/microwave extraction technology, which directly combines the two extraction modes to make full use of both ultrasound vibrational energy and thermal effect of microwave irradiation [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. This method has many advantages, such as fast heating speed, low energy consumption, low solvent requirements, and high recovery rate. Simultaneous ultrasound/microwave extraction is also beneficial for the extraction of polar and thermally unstable components and avoids the decomposition that results from extraction or synthetic procedures with long processing times, high temperatures, and high pressures [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. This technique has been applied to the extraction of alkaloids [
