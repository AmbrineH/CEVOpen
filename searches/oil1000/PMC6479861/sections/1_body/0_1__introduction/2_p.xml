<p class="p">The study of different assisted methods, such as ultrasound-assisted, which use the mechanical, cavitation, and thermal effects of ultrasound to increase penetration of the medium by increasing the velocity of its motion [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], has been conducted in recent years. The cavitation produced by ultrasound greatly improves the heterogeneous reaction rate, achieves uniform mixing between heterogeneous reactants, accelerates reactant and product diffusion, promotes the formation of new solid phases, and controls the size and distribution of particles [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In contrast, microwave irradiation is as an energy source to induce molecular movement and rotation of liquids with permanent dipoles [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Thus, the biomass material absorbs microwave energy and cell temperature increases rapidly, such that the internal pressure of the cell exceeds the expansion capacity of the cell wall, resulting in cellular breakdown. This allows intracellular active ingredients to flow freely and be captured and dissolved at lower temperatures. Thus, it has a wide application range [
