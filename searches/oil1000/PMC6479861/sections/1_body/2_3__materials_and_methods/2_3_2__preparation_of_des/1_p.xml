<p class="p">Because ChCl has strong water absorption, it was placed in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h before the experiment. A certain amount of ChCl and EG was weighed and placed into a conical flask; the composition of DES was uniformly mixed according to the molar ratio, and the specific molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5) were operated [

Similarly, ChCl and GI, ChCl and BDO were weighed to obtain ChCl-GI and ChCl-BDO.
