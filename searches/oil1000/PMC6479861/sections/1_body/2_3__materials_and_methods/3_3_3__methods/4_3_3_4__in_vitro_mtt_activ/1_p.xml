The amount of crystals produced was proportional to the number of living cells (succinate dehydrogenase in dead cells disappeared and MTT cannot be reduced). The mouse splenic lymphocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. First, cell suspensions were seeded in 96-well plates (1 × 105/well), and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h; then the polysaccharides were added. After 6 h, a certain amount of MTT were added into each well and the plate was further incubated for 4 h. Finally, the medium was removed and 200 μL DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan. After 10 min, absorbance at 490 nm was measured [
