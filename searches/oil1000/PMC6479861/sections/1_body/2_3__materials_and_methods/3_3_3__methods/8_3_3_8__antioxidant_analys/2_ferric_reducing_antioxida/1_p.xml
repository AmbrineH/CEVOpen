 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Tests were performed in triplicate and repeated with VC as the control. The reducing antioxidant power of the sample was expressed in Trolox equivalents, which is the ratio of the slope of the sample regression line to the Trolox slope.
