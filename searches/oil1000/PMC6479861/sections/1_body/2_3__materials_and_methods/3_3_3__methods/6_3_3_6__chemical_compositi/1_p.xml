<p class="p">GC-MS analysis of the essential oil was carried out on an Agilent 6890N-5973 insert gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a capillary column (30mm × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) equipped with an Agilent 6890N-5973 mass selective detector in the electron impact mode. The GC was operated under the following conditions: manual injection 1 μL; injector temperature, 270 °C; carrier gas (He) flow 1 mL/min; oven temperature programmed 40 °C to 165 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, from 165 °C to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and 200 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The detector temperature was 280 °C. The MS was operated under 70 eV, scan range 15–500 amu, scan-TIC. The chemical compositions of essential oils were identified by direct comparison of their mass spectral pattern in NIST02 Mass Spectral Library.</p>
