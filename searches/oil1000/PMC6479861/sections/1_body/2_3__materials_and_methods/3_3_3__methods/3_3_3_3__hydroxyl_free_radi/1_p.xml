 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharide (0.05–0.50 mg/mL) was added to a mixed solution (3 mL) containing 2-deoxyribose (3 mM), ferric chloride (0.1 mM), hydrogen peroxide (1 mM), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (0.1 mM), VC (0.1 mM), and phosphate buffer solution (0.02 M, pH 7.4), and heated at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, tert-Butanol (1 mL, 1%) and trichloroacetic acid (1 mL, 2.8%) solutions were added, followed by heating at 100 °C for 20 min. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature and analyzed at 536 nm. The ability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharide to scavenge hydroxyl free radical with polysaccharide concentration was analyzed. The unit of polysaccharide concentration was mg/mL, and the unit of cell proliferation rate was %.
