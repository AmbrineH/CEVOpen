<p class="p">Accurately weighed Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (100.0 mg) was dissolved in 95% ethanol (50.0 mL); 85% phosphoric acid (100 mL) was added, and the mixture was diluted to 1,000 mL with distilled water. Accurately weighed crystal bovine serum protein standard (10.0 mg) was diluted to 100 mL in a volumetric flask with NaCl solution (0.15 M), giving a 0.1 mg/mL albumin standard solution. 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0 mL of NaCl solution (0.15 M) was added to produce 10.0 mL of the solution. To 0.1 mL of the above albumin concentration gradient solution was added 5.0 mL Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 solution, shaking well. Using BSA as the standard, a protein standard curve was prepared using this Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 staining method [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The standard curve was drawn and used the formula

 <italic class="italic">X</italic> + 0.0009 (
