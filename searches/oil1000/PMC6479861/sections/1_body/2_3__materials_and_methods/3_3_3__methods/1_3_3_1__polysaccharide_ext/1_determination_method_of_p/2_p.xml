<p class="p">Accurately weighed standard glucose (10.0 mg) was placed in a 100-mL volumetric flask and water was added to the scale of 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 10.0 mL, respectively, to produce a 10.0 mL solution. Glucose solution concentration gradient of 2.0 mL was taken and mixed with distilled water to 10.0 mL. Six percent phenol solution 1.0 mL was then added to it with concentrated sulfuric acid 5.0 mL, followed by shaking and then cooling. The glucose standard curve used the formula
