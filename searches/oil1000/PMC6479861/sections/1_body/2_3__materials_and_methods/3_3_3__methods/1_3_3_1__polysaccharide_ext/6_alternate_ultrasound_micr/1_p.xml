 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> (10.0 g) was placed in a round bottom flask and DES (300 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was extracted using alternating microwave and ultrasound treatments in the ultrasound/microwave extraction apparatus, and the extraction procedure was optimized. According to 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01288-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the experiments A-G used total polysaccharide extraction time of 60 min. The extraction process was optimized by changing the extraction time and extraction sequence of the ultrasound/microwave under the same conditions, and using a reflux extraction method (experiment H) for comparison. The same operation methods used in the section “Compared Extraction Method of Polysaccharides” were employed after the extraction was complete.
