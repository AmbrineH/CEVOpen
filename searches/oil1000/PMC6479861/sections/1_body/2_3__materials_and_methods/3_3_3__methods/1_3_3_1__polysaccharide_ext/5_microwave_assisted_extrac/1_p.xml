 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> (10.0 g) was placed in a round bottom flask and DES (300 mL) was added. The mixture was placed in the ultrasound/microwave extraction apparatus, and microwave irradiation was conducted for 30 min at 250 W. A sample was taken every 5.0 min to obtain the extraction kinetic curve. The same operation methods used in the section “Compared Extraction Method of Polysaccharides” were employed after the extraction was complete. The extracted essential oil was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a freezer.
