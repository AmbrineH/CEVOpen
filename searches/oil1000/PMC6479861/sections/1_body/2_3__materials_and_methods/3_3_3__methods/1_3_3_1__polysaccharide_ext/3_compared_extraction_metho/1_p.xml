 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> (10.0 g) was placed in a round bottom flask and hydrothermally distilled with DES (300 mL). The mixture was refluxed for 4 h. After the extraction was complete, the supernatant was filtered, cooled, and anhydrous ethanol was slowly added to give an ethanol volume fraction of 80%. After centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min with a 3K-30 ultracentrifuge (Sigma-Aldrich), the crude polysaccharide yield was calculated, and the sample was stored at −20 °C in an LGJ-10 freeze dryer, which was purchased from Brothers Equipment Co., Ltd. (Henan, China). The polysaccharide was extracted using the aqueous extraction-alcohol precipitation method, and DES was dissolved in alcohol solution and removed with liquid phase after centrifugation. Recovery of DES was done through decompression concentration.
