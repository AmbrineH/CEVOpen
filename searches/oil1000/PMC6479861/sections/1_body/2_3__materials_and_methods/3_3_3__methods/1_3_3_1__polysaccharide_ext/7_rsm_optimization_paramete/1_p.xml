<p class="p">To further study the interaction between the factors, we optimized the operating conditions by RSM and used the Box-Behnken software for data processing [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The Box-Benhnken design with three factors was applied using Design-Expert 8.0 without any blocking. The bounds of the ultrasound factors were 1:20–1:40 solid–liquid ratio, 400–700 W ultrasound power, 30–50 min extraction time. Specific protocols for experimental conditions are shown in
