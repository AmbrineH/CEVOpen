<p class="p">DES was found as a green medium to successfully extract high purity 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides and essential oils. The optimal reagent was prepared from choline chloride and ethylene glycol with molar ratio 1:3 and solvent ratio 7:3 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>. By optimizing the ultrasonic/microwave, an extraction condition of 550W (UE), 250W (ME), and solid-liquid ratio of 1:30 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> was obtained. Besides, in the experiment of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides, it was found that the crude polysaccharide was deproteinized four times by Sevag method to obtain maximum fine polysaccharide (5.11 g/100g); in the scavenging activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharide toward hydroxyl radical, we found when the sampling concentration was more than 0.20 mg/mL, and the scavenging activity had almost doubled. The in vitro activity test of polysaccharides showed that 0.20 mg/mL was the optimal concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides with Lps cells—it was about 1.5-fold better than that with ConA cells. Similarly, the essential oil extraction method was compared and 400 W (UE) and 20 min were selected. In the antioxidant experiments of essential oils, the free radical scavenging activity of DES UMHD extracts determined by β-carotene is first-rate. Furthermore, the FRAP assay of essential oils showed that the DES UMHD sample had optimal antioxidant activity. This indicates that DES presents an efficient separation of essential oils and polysaccharides from natural plants under ultrasound/microwave digestion.
