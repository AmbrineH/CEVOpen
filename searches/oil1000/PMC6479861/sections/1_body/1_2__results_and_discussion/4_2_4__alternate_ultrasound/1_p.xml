<p class="p">Based on the above optimum experiments, the experimental arrangement of alternating ultrasound and microwave-assisted extractions of polysaccharides was designed, and the essential oil yield was also detected. The results showed that microwave-assisted extraction obtained a higher polysaccharide yield (7.83 ± 0.12 g/100g compared with 7.02 ± 0.11 g/100g for ultrasound-assisted extraction). In alternating experiments C–F, with extraction time under the same conditions, the polysaccharide yield obtained by microwave extraction was slightly higher than that by ultrasound treatment at first, with a higher number of alternations leading to a shortened extraction time and higher polysaccharide yield (
