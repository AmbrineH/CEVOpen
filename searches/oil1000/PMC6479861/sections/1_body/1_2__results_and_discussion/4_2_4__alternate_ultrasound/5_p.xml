 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> has a high degree of lignification and the surface of the raw material is dense. The first step is microwave-assisted extractionâ€”the microwave selectively heats the intracellular polar molecules, such that the intracellular pressure of the cells is larger than the extracellular pressure; and ruptures and some effective substances are dissolved from the cells. In the ultrasound method, due to its cavitation effect, the bubble mix in the extracellular solvent collapses, and the jet is formed outside the cell to increase the flow rate of the solvent on the cell surface and enter the cell interior. In the microwave treatment (third step), the thermal effect not only cause the cells to swell again, but also rapidly transfers the solvent of the dissolved polysaccharide to the extracellular, which greatly increases extraction efficiency and allows more effective substances to be dispersed outside the cells. Therefore, when the fourth step uses more ultrasound, the permeability of the cell membrane is further increased due to the oscillating effect, and the instantaneous large pulling force generated by the gas blasting causes more solvent to enter the cell; the solvent and gas dissolved in the solvent also enter the cell, and bubble collapse occurs, such that the effective substance is better dissolved in the solvent.
