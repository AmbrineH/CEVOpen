<p class="p">In summary, alternate ultrasound/microwave extraction treatment destroys the sample microstructure without a high-temperature heat source, which could eliminate the temperature gradient and heating speed, while avoiding decomposition and isomerization of natural products due to long extraction times. Therefore, compared with reflux extraction, this method is more conducive for the extraction of heat-sensitive substances. It is a more efficient extraction method in the pretreatment of plant material in the food chemistry field.</p>
