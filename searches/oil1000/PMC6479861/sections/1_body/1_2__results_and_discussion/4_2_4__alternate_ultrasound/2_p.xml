<p class="p">Important factors for evaluating extraction methods are extraction rate, cost, ease of operation, time, and environmental pollution. Herein, the alternating ultrasound and microwave extraction methods were evaluated with respect to the yield, extraction time, and environmental assessment of the crude polysaccharides. Refluxing extraction requires an extraction time of 4 h and uses a heating sleeve that consumes 1 kW of power every hour, giving a total energy consumption of 4.0 kWh, and emits around 3200 g of carbon dioxide. However, on using microwave heating power of 0.25 kW and ultrasound auxiliary power of 0.55 kW, the alternating extraction method emitted only 360 g of carbon dioxide per experiment. Alternating experiment F achieved the highest polysaccharide extraction rate of 8.87 Â± 0.29 g/100g (
