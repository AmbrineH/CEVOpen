<p class="p">In the electric field generated by microwaves, friction occurs between the moving ions and the medium, which may cause heating; besides, dipolar molecules attempt to align with alternating electric fields in the medium, and their oscillations cause collisions with surrounding molecules to generate heat. As the temperature inside the cell rises rapidly, the intracellular pressure increased beyond the capacity tolerated by the expansion of the cell wall, resulting in cell rupture, which accelerated the rate at which the polysaccharide molecules of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> diffused from the solid to the solid-liquid interface. Then, at sufficiently high power, the sparse cycle produced by the ultrasound might exceed the attractive force of the molecules of the fluid and form cavitation bubbles. The suspended solid promotes the collapse of the asymmetric bubble, which produces extremely high-speed jets that are directed at 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic>, thereby promoting its extraction.
