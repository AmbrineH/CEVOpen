<p class="p">Using SEM to observe the fruit before and after different extraction methods, it was concluded that ultrasound expanded and ruptured the cells through shaking and cavitation, while microwave destroyed most of the cell walls in the alternating treatment, which greatly improved the rate of heterogeneous reaction and achieving uniform mixing between the heterogeneous reactants (
