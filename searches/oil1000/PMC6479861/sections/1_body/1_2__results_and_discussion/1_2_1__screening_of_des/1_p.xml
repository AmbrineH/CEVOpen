<p class="p">In a typical reaction, ChCl (hydrogen bond acceptor) and ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (GI), or 1,4-butanediol (BDO) (hydrogen bond donors) were mixed. A greater number of OH is provided by GI when the ratios of polyol are the same; however, better water absorbent performance of GI may form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds with ChCl. Compared with BDO, steric effected the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds with smaller ChCl. Therefore, the screening optimization of DES HBA and HBD is of great significance. In our study, ChCl and EG, GI or BDO were mixed separately in different molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5), and heated at 80 °C oil bath until a transparent solution was obtained. Then, water was added to maintain a solution ratio (DES:H

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a. The results show that the DES solvent (ChCl-EG 1:3 molar ratio) extracted chitin showed a high yield of 6.86 ± 0.10 g/100g. After that, the DES was selected as ChCl-EG 1:3, and the solution ratios (5:5, 6:4, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1) were changed to obtain an optimal condition of 7:3
