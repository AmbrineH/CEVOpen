<p class="p">Using the reflux extraction method to optimize the solid-liquid ratio for polysaccharide extraction, five

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>, refluxed for 4 h, and the polysaccharide extraction rates calculated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a). When the solid-liquid ratio was increased from 1:10 to 1:30, the polysaccharide extraction rate increased. Solid-liquid ratios of more than 1:30 resulted in lower polysaccharide extraction rates. Therefore, the optimal solid-liquid ratio was 1:30 (
