 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b,c). At ultrasound powers of less than 550 W, the polysaccharide yield increased with increasing ultrasound power. However, the polysaccharide yields at ultrasound powers of 550 W and 700 W were similar. Therefore, an ultrasound power of 550 W was selected for subsequent experiments. In the microwave extraction process, the polysaccharide yields gradually increased with increasing microwave power, with 250 W selected as optimal microwave power for subsequent experiments.
