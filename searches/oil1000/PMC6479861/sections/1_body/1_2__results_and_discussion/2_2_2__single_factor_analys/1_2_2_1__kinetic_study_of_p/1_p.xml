<p class="p">Using reflux extraction, the extraction yield of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides tended to be balanced after 4 h, reaching 8.56 g/100g (dry weight). In the ultrasound extraction process, the polysaccharide yield increased with increasing extraction time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), but showed little further variation after an extraction time of 40 min, remaining at 7.44 ± 0.18 g/100g. In the microwave extraction process, the polysaccharide yield increased with increasing extraction time, but showed almost no further change after an extraction time of 20 min, with the polysaccharide yield remaining at 8.02 ± 0.26 g/100g. Therefore, the optimal extraction times for the extraction methods were 4 h, 40 min, and 20 min for reflux, ultrasound-assisted, and microwave-assisted extraction, respectively.
