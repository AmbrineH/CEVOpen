<p class="p">To further study the interactions between the factors, we optimized the solid–liquid ratio, extraction time, and ultrasound power. In 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01288-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the maximum value of extraction efficiency was defined as 100%, and compared with the other values. The model F-value of 19.51 indicated that the model was significant, but the probability for the occurrence of such model F-value was only 0.01%, which can be treated as statistical noise. Values of “Probability &gt; F” less than the 0.0500 indicated model terms were significant. The “lack of fit F-value” of 247.97 implied that the lack of fit was significant. The probability of the occurrence of such a “lack of fit F-value” was only 0.01% and can be treated as statistical noise. The response surfaces for the effect of independent variables on extraction efficiency of lignans are shown in
