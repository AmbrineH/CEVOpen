The software predicted that the yield of polysaccharides was 8.44 g/100g; however, in our realistic operation process, the parameters of ultrasound power, extraction time and solid-liquid ratio were selected as 550 W, 40 min, and 1:30 respectively; the yield of polysaccharides was 8.56 g/100g, and error rate was 1.42%.
