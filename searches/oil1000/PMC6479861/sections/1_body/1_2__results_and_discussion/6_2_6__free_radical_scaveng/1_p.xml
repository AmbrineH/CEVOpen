<p class="p">Excellent antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharide was demonstrated in hydroxyl radical scavenging tests (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>). The hydroxyl radicals were produced by Fenton reaction. Hydrogen peroxide/Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> system can produce free radicals as follows: H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> + Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> → •OH + OH
 <sup class="sup">–</sup> + Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup>. It can be seen that the generation of a hydroxyl radical depends on the content of Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The polysaccharide scavenges the excessive oxygen free radicals produced in vivo and blocks the free radical reaction chain in vivo. The polysaccharide was formulated to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, and serially diluted to 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 mg/mL. Polysaccharide sample solutions and vitamin C (VC) solutions with the same concentrations were prepared. At low concentrations (less than 0.20 mg/mL), the polysaccharide free radical scavenging activity was similar to that of VC. At a concentration of 0.20 mg/mL, the free radical scavenging activities were 28.02% (polysaccharide) and 23.68% (VC). However, at sample concentrations of more than 0.20 mg/mL, the scavenging activity of the polysaccharide increased with increasing concentration, while the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of VC gradually plateaued. At a concentration of 0.50 mg/mL, the clearance rates using the polysaccharides and VC were 66.3% and 36.49%, respectively. Therefore, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides was better than that of VC at sample concentrations of more than 0.20 mg/mL. This was because according to the Fenton reaction, there are three reagents—oxidant, reducer and metal ion—and the generation of a hydroxyl radical depends on the content of Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. However, there are several nature metal ions (such as Fe, Zn, Cu) in polysaccharide. Moreover, if the absolute concentrations of Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> are higher than H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and VC, a part of VC was used to reduce Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup>, which results in inhibition of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Finally, the Fenton reaction was inhibited and •OH was not generated [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01288" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Therefore, the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was better at higher concentrations of polysaccharides compared to VC.
