<p class="p">The traditional hydro-distillation method is used to extract essential oil; essential oils precipitates with boiling water at 100 Â°C, and the polysaccharide is extracted by aqueous extraction-alcohol precipitation method. Thus, the DES hydro-distillation method was suitable for simultaneously extracting crude polysaccharides and essential oils, and the crude polysaccharide was precipitated by subsequently increasing the alcohol content of the DES solution, and then filtered, which completely separated polysaccharide from DES solution. When the extraction time of MHD and DES UMHD treatment was increased from 0 min to 20 min, the average essential oil extraction efficiency increased dramatically. Therefore, 20 min was selected as the extraction time for further experiments. The essential oil yield showed little change after 25 min of MHD and DES UMHD treatment. However, in the HD reaction, essential oil precipitation slowly began to appear after 30 min, with 120 min required to reach the essential oil yield obtained with the other methods, and further treatment resulted in a small steady increase (

This phenomenon, which is attributed to heat transfer, is mainly achieved through conduction and convection only in the HD process. In contrast, in the MHD and UMHD processes, heat transfer was achieved through radiation, conduction, and convection. The ionization of DES in water produced salts that make the essential oils more likely to precipitate. Among them, DES UMHD produced the highest essential oil yield. As for ChCl-based acidic DESs, studies have inferred that Cl

Thus, better biomass deconstruction and hydro-distillation performance of DESs solution was achieved as compared to the water, thereby increasing the yield of the essential oil [
