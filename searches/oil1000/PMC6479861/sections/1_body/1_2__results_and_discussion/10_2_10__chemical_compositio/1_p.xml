<p class="p">The compositions of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> essential oil were obtained through HD, MHD and DES UMHD. Thirty-six components of essential oil obtained by DES UMHD and 18 components obtained by HD and MHD were investigated. The relative amount percent of individual volatile compounds was expressed as percent peak areas relative to total peak areas by GC-MS analysis (RA %) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01288-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The main components were the same—Ylangene, (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>). Olefin had high unsaturation and strong reducing ability. As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>, the olefin content was relatively high—Ylangene (RA = 28.63%), (E)-α-bergamotene (RA = 10.62%), and β-himachalene (RA = 10.60%)—thus, showing that the essential oil had a certain antioxidant capacity.
