<p class="p">An increasing amount of deproteinized proteins causes the protein content in the crude polysaccharide solution to gradually decrease, and the polysaccharide content to diminish (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>). In the first four deproteinizations, the protein content reduction ratio and polysaccharide loss were larger. After four rounds, the protein and polysaccharide content slowly decreased. In order to ensure polysaccharide content, deproteinization was performed no more than four times. The deproteinized polysaccharide solution was concentrated and lyophilized to obtain refined
