<p class="p">The reduction capacity of a compound can indicate its potential antioxidant activity. A higher absorbance indicates a higher ferric-reducing power, with the essential oils from different extraction methods and standards showing increasing ferric-reducing power as the concentration increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>b). At 0.15 mg/mL, the highest reducing power of DES UMHD (A
 <sub class="sub">593</sub> = 1.817) was 856.05 (TE)/g, while the reducing power of HD (A
 <sub class="sub">593</sub> = 0.365) was 130.05 (TE)/g. Therefore, the reducing power of essential oils and antioxidants was in the order of DES UMHD &gt; VC &gt; BHA &gt; HD.
