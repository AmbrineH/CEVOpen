 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01288-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>c. The inhibition capacity of linoleic acid oxidation by HD was 14.25%. Therefore, for the Î²-carotene-linoleic acid bleaching assay, a descending order of inhibition capacity of VC &gt; DES UMHD &gt; HD &gt; BHA is shown.
