<p class="p">Freshly prepared DPPH solution has a deep purple color with maximum absorption (1.24) at 517 nm that generally fades when an antioxidant is present in the medium. Therefore, antioxidant molecules can annihilate hydrogen atoms or electrons provided by DPPH and convert them into colorless products, resulting in a decrease in absorbance at 517 nm. With increasing essential oil concentration, a significant increase in inhibition rate was observed, with the low IC50 value indicating that the sample had strong antioxidant activity. The IC50 values of DES UMHD and HD samples were 29.82 µg/mL and 52.34 µg/mL, respectively (

In this study, the antioxidant activity of essential oils has shown that monoterpenes have a higher antioxidant effect, while the major component of
