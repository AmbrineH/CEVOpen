 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides have strong immune activities that can significantly promote the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes, with increasing polysaccharide concentration also increasing the cell proliferation rate (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01288-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). At a polysaccharide concentration of 0.20 mg/mL, the cell proliferation rate was the largest, at about 30%. When the polysaccharide concentration reached 0.80 mg/mL, the cells showed almost no proliferation, with a proliferation rate of less than 5.00%. Therefore, 0.20 mg/mL was selected as the optimal
