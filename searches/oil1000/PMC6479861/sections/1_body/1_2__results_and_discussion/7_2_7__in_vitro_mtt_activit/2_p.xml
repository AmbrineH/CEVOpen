<p class="p">ConA and Lps are effective mitogens that promote lymphocyte transformation. This experiment confirmed the synergistic effect of 
 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides and ConA or Lps cells. The role of ConA and Lps was to proliferate more than twice as much as the polysaccharides (

 <italic class="italic">S. chinensis</italic> polysaccharides with the Lps cells was about 1.5 times better than that with the ConA cells.
