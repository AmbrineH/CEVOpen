 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>) and (Z) - ligustilide (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>) were chosen for molecular docking, because these compounds were specific and major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> essential oil. Isoniazid as the first-line anti-tuberculous drug was selected as standard compound. Isoniazid has shown to act on 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> by inhibiting a 2-trans-enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, called InhA (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Due to this reason, InhA was selected for doing molecular docking. Docking score of compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 was equal to −5.5, −6, −5.4, −6.4 kcal/mol respectively, that was comparable with docking score of isoniazid, by −4.6 kcal/mol.
