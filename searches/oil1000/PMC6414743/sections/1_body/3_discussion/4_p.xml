<p class="p">α-Terpinenyl acetate, (Z) – ligustilide and neocnidilide as specific and major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> essential oil have more affinity to receptor even more than isoniazid, but isoniazid, unlike these compounds has common hydrogen bond. A conventional hydrogen bond is considered as an essential and vital interaction between drug and receptor. Due to this reason, it is fundamental to make change in the structure of compounds (1, 2 and 3) and investigate SAR and QSAR of these compounds to improve their anti-TB activity.
