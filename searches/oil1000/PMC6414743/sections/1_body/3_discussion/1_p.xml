<p class="p">In the previous study by Mirjalili et al., antibacterial activity of essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> at different fruiting stages (immature, mature and ripened) of the plant has been studied against 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>. The mature and ripened fruit oils showed activity with MIC values of 0.9â€“1.8 mg/ml against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis, S. epidermidis.</italic> Also the essential oils at these stages exhibited sensitivity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with MIC=7.2 mg/ml (
