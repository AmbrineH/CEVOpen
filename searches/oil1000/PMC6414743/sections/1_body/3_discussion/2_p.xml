<p class="p">The composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> essential oil has been investigated widely and about 190 compounds have been reported. The presence of phthalide compounds is a characteristic for 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> essential oil. The content of phthalide compounds depends on the geographic location and weather conditions, critical phtalide compounds are propylidenephthalide, (E,Z)-ligustilide, (Z,E)-3-butylidenephthalide and dihydro-butylidenephthalide. Also there are terpenoids compounds including α- and β-phellandrenes, α- and β-pinenes, α-terpinyl acetate and α-terpineol (

 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> were β-phellandrenes (42.5%) and α-terpineol (27.9%) that was reported by Rizi et al. (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). In another study, significant compounds in leaves oil of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> were β-phellandrene, α-terpinyl acetate and (Z)-ligustilide, and their content values were equal to 11.3%, 55.8% and 17.0% respectively (
