<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> essential oil extracted form aerial parts of this plant was relatively active against MDR 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic>. It will be interesting to isolate compounds of the essential oil and evaluate their anti-TB activity separately, since based on the molecular docking studies done in the present study it has been shown that predominant compounds of the essential oil have had high affinity to inhibit the 2-trans-enoylacyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) as an important enzyme in
