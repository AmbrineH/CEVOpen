<p class="p">The Agilent gas chromatograph (FID) with a DB-5 fused silica column (30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness) was used to GC analysis. Nitrogen was used as a gas carrier at a constant flow of 1.1 mL/min, a split ratio of 1:50. The oven temperature was set from 60 to 250°C at 4°C/min, and then isothermal for 15 min. The injector and FID temperatures were programmed at 240°C and 250°C, respectively.</p>
