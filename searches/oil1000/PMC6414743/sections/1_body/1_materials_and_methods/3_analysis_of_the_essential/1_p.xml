<p class="p">Thermoquest Finnigan Trace GC–MS instrument equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness) was used for GC-MS analysis. The temperature of the oven was set from 60 to 250°C at 4°C/min, and then isothermal for 15 min. The FID and injector temperatures were programmed at 240°C and 250°C, respectively. Helium was used as carrier gas at the constant flow rate of 1.1 ml/min and a split ratio of 1:100. Mass range was 45–450 amu and the MS operating parameters were: ion source temperature, 200°C; ionization voltage, 70 eV (
