<p class="p">The structure of compounds (1â€“4 and isoniazid), were drawn by Chem Draw Professional 15.0, and the structures were transferred to Chem3D and were saved as PDB format. Then in order to perform the energy minimization of the structures MM2 force field method was used. Finally minimized ligands in the PDB format were saved as PDBQT files using the Auto-Duck tool. The crystal structure of InhA with PDB ID: 1BVR was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). The protein structure was prepared by removing water and adding hydrogens and the protein file was saved as the PDBQT format for molecular docking studies.</p>
