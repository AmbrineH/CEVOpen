<p class="p">Molecular docking was performed for determining binding modes of the ligands using Auto-Dock Vina software (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). The binding site residues of InhA with grid center at X:12.832, Y:16.388, Z: 6.306 and the number of points in each dimension as X:20, Y:20, Z:20 and Spacing (Ã…): 1.0 were originated from a previous study (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). Binding site residues and grid box of InhA were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. In order to show interactions between ligand and receptor Discovery Studio Visualizer v4.5 was used.
