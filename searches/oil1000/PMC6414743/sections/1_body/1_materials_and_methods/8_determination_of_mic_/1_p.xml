<p class="p">The serial dilution of each essential oil was completed in a concentration ranged from 0.250 to 1008 μg/mL in the sterile 96 wells. Also, Mueller-Hinton broth medium supplemented by 0.5% tween 80 was used as co-solvent as well as trace value. The suspensions were diluted in seven serial dilutions. The 100 μl of solution was transferred from column 1 to next column, and identical serial 1:2 dilutions were continued through column 7 (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). A column without essential oil was inoculated as a growth control. A well with 80 μl of supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 medium and 20 μl of DMSO alone was also inoculated in each row for refuse anti-mycobacterial effect of DMSO. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 weeks. The wells were evaluated after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days and they were compared with the control wells. MIC was defined as the lowest essential oils concentration that exhibited no growth through visual inspection (
