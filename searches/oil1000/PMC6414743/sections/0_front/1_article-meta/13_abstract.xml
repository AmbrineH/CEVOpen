  <title class="title">Background and Objectives:</title>
  <p class="p">Essential oils are used for controlling and preventing human diseases and the application of those can often be quite safe and effective with no side effect. The essential oils have been found to have antiparasitic, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and especially antibacterial activity including antibacterial activity against tuberculosis. In this study the chemical composition and anti-TB activity of essential oil extracted from 
   <italic class="italic">Levisticum officinale</italic> has been evaluated.

  <title class="title">Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p class="p">The essential oil of 
   <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> was obtained by the hydro distillation method and the oil was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS techniques. The antibacterial activity of essential oil was evaluated through Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assay using micro broth dilution method against multidrug-resistant 
   <italic class="italic">Maycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. The molecular modeling of major compounds was evaluated through molecular docking using Auto Dock Vina against-2-trans-enoyl-ACP reductase (InhA) as key enzyme in 
   <italic class="italic">M. tuberclosis</italic> cell wall biosynthesis.

  <title class="title">Results:</title>
  <p class="p">The hydrodistillation on aerial parts of 
   <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> yielded 2.5% v/w of essential oil. The major compounds of essential oil were identified as α-terpinenyl acetate (52.85%), β- phellandrene (10.26%) and neocnidilide (10.12%). The essential oil showed relatively good anti-MDR 
   <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> with MIC = 252 μg/ml. The results of Molecular Docking showed that affinity of major compounds was comparable to isoniazid.

  <title class="title">Conclusion:</title>
  <p class="p">The essential oil of aerial parts extracted from 
   <italic class="italic">L. officinale</italic> was relatively active against MDR 
   <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic>, and molecular docking showed the major compounds had high affinity to inhibit 2-trans-enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) as an important enzyme in 
   <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> cell wall biosynthesis.
