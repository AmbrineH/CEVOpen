<p class="p">Similar to the imaging technique, variations do exist for spectroscopy. These variations are categorized by the nature of interaction between the light source and the sample when the spectroscopy measurement is conducted. In the agricultural field, the commonly adopted spectroscopy techniques are ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy [
