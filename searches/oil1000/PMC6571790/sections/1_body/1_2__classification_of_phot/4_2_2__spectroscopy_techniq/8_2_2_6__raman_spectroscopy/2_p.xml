<p class="p">The RS technique is gaining popularity as it enables the identification of molecular structure through the characteristic wavenumber in which vibrations occur. Furthermore, samples can be studied in the absence of a solvent as water causes weak Raman scattering. Not least, this technique is instantaneous and may undergo intensity enhancement. However, this technique is not without limitations. Due to the low probability of Raman scattering, this technique requires high concentration of samples. Moreover, sample molecules may experience photo degradation due to excitation of electronic absorption bands. The existence of fluorescence from impurities may disrupt the results obtained as well. These limitations aside, the RS technique can be combined with IR spectroscopy to deliver satisfactory results as summarized in
