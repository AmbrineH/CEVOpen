<p class="p">Raman spectroscopy (RS), similar to IR spectroscopy, is another form of vibrational spectroscopy technique. RS obtains the spectral information of samples due to the occurrence of Raman effects [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02025-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. In the case of elastic scattering or Rayleigh scattering, the excited photons experience no change in energy content upon returning to ground state. Alternately, in the case of inelastic scattering or Raman scattering, the excited photons may lose (Stokes’ shift) or gain (Anti-Stokes’ shift) energy equivalent to the vibrational energy changes in the atoms of the molecules. This affects the motion of the atoms as well as the polarizability of the molecule. The change in molecule polarizability results in increased Raman intensity, ultimately forming the Raman spectrum when plotted across the investigated wavenumbers. However, this effect is weak as the probability of energy exchange is low [
