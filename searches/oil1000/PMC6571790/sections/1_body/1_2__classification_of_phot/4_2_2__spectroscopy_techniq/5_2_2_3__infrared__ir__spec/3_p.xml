<p class="p">Molecular vibrations, which occur regardless the presence of IR light source, result in an increase in light absorption. These peaks in absorption form specific bands in the IR spectrum that correspond to the specific frequencies in which molecular vibrations occur. This allows the easy identification of the molecular structure in a sample since different molecules have different vibration frequencies [
