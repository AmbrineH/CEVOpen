<p class="p">Infrared (IR) spectroscopy operates within the IR band with wavelengths from 780 nm to 1 mm. The IR band can be further broken down into three sub-bands, namely near-infrared (NIR; 780 nm to 5 µm), mid-infrared (MIR; 5 µm to 30 µm) and far-infrared (FIR; 30 µm to 1 mm). In agriculture-related optics and photonics, the NIR and MIR bands are of greater interest [
