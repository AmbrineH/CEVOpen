<p class="p">IR spectroscopy obtains the spectral information of a subject due to molecular vibrations under the excitation of an IR light source. In general, molecular vibrations occur when there exist normal modes of vibrations. A normal mode of vibration (or fundamental) refers to the phenomenon in which every atom in a molecule experiences a simple harmonic oscillation about its equilibrium position. These atoms oscillate in phase at the same frequency while the center of gravity of the molecule remains unchanged. A typical molecule has 3N-6 fundamentals (3N-5 for linear molecules), where N refers to the number of atoms. The diatomic molecular vibrations are illustrated in
