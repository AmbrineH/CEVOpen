<p class="p">Fluorescence spectroscopy is highly specific and highly sensitive. The high specificity of the technique arises from the usage of both the excitation and emission spectra; whereas high sensitivity is achieved as radiation measurements are made against absolute darkness. These characteristics however limit the independent usage of the technique [
