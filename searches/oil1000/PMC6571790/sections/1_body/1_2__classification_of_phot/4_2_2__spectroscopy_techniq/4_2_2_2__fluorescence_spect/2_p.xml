<p class="p">The fluorescence phenomenon can be explained with a Jablonski diagram illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02025-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. It should first be understood that fluorescence involves the three electronic states of a fluorophore molecule, namely the singlet ground, first and second electronic states. These states are represented by S
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, S
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and S
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02025-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The key condition for fluorescence to occur is the excitation of the molecule from the ground state, S
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> to either electronic states S
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> or S
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> upon the absorption of light. If the molecule reaches the S
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> state, internal conversion or vibrational relaxation will occur, returning the molecule to the lower S
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> state without radiation emitted. From here, the molecule will again return to the S
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> while emitting light which has equal energy as the energy difference between S
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and S
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>. This light emission is known as fluorescence and this condition typically occurs 10
 <sup class="sup">-8</sup> seconds after the initial excitation [
