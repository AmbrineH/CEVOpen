<p class="p">The near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy operates within the NIR band with wavelengths from 780 nm to 5 µm. The absorptions within the NIR band exist due to overtones and combinations of the fundamental vibrations. Overtones refer to higher frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental frequency. Meanwhile, combinations involve interactions between two or more vibrations occurring simultaneously, resulting in a frequency which is the sum of multiples of the respective frequencies. A majority of the absorptions in the NIR band are due to vibrations of the C–H, O–H and N–H bands. The S–H and C=O bonds too potentially contribute to these absorptions. Several assignments of the NIR absorption bands can be seen in
