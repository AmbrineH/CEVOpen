<p class="p">NIR spectroscopy, which is a non-destructive measurement, enables the simultaneous identification of components in a single sample within a short period of time, making it a preferable replacement for various chemical techniques. However, consideration should be taken into account as this technique requires initial calibration with samples of known composition, requiring great expenses of time and resources. Not least, frequent recalibration and issue of instrument interoperability might affect the practicality of the NIR spectroscopy technique [
