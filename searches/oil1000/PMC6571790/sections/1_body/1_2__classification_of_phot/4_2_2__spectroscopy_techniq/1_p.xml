<p class="p">In contrast to the imaging technique, the spectroscopy technique enables the ‘sight’ of properties that are invisible to the naked eye. The spectroscopy technique functions by extracting spectral information from the sample of interest. The spectral information is obtained when light interacts with the composition of the sample. This interaction leads to changes in the intensity or frequency and wavelength of the initial light source, ultimately defining a spectrum which acts as the fingerprint of the sample [
