<p class="p">MIR spectroscopy is effective since it provides information on structure-function relationships while performing quantitative analysis. The structure-function relationships are useful in food research and quality control, making MIR spectroscopy a crucial technique in the field of agriculture. The Fourier transform process is often bundled with MIR spectroscopy for data analysis, forming the popular Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technique [
