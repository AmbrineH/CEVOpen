<p class="p">The X–H stretching region is due to vibrations from O–H, C–H and N–H stretching. The triple-bond region arises from vibrations of C≡C and C≡N bonds. Besides, the double-bond region relates to C=C, C=O and C=N vibrations. Lastly, the fingerprint region roots on bending and skeletal vibrations.
