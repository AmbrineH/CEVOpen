<p class="p">The mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy operates within the MIR band with wavelengths from 5 µm to 30 µm (wavenumbers from 4000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 400 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; note the presence of slight overlapping with NIR). The absorptions that occur within the MIR band are due to fundamental vibrations and can be segregated into four regions, namely the X–H stretching region (4000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 2500 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), triple-bond region (2500 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 2000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), double-bond region (2000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 1500 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) as well as the fingerprint region (1500 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 600 cm
