<p class="p">A typical model that illustrates Beer-Lambert’s law can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02025-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. It can be observed that as light propagates through a sample, a portion of the incidental light source will be absorbed by the molecules in the sample, while the remaining light rays will transmit and escape across the sample. The ratio between the intensity of the incident and escaped rays defines the absorbance of light by the sample. This value of light absorbance is of main interest in UV-VIS spectroscopy. As in Equation (2), light absorbance is dependent on
