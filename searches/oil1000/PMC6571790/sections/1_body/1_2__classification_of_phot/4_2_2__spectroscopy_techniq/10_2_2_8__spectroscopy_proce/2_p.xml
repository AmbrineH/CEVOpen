<p class="p">Upon the completion of pre-processing or pre-treatment, the data set undergoes multivariate analysis to select and extract wavelengths that contain useful information. This aids in rectifying issues of collinearity, band overlapping and interaction between spectral variables. The results from multivariate analysis will be used to develop calibration models for calibration and prediction purposes [
