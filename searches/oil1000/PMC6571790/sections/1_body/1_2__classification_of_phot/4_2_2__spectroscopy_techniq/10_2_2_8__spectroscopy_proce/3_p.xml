<p class="p">The developed calibration models can be categorized according to the nature of the utilized multivariate analysis such as linear regression or nonlinear regression. Calibration models based on linear regression are built from partial least squares (PLS), interval partial least squares (iPLS), synergy interval partial least squares (SiPLS) or successive projections algorithm (SPA). Meanwhile, calibration models based on nonlinear regression are constructed from principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) or a genetic algorithm (GA) [
