<p class="p">The robustness of the final calibration model is evaluated from its ability to perform calibration and prediction. The calibration performance of the model is determined from the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and the correlation coefficient (R
 <sub class="sub">C</sub>) in the calibration set. Meanwhile, the prediction performance of the model is identified from the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and the correlation coefficient (R
 <sub class="sub">P</sub>) in the prediction set. Ideally, an effective model should register low RMSEC and RMSEP, with minimum difference between RMSEC and RMSEP. Not least, higher R
 <sub class="sub">C</sub> and R
 <sub class="sub">P</sub> are preferable [
