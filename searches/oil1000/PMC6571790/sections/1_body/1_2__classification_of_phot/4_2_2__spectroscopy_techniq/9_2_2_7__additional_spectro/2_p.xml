<p class="p">A chemical shift occurs due to different resonant frequencies present in nuclei of the same species. The difference in resonant frequencies is a result of shielding effect from electrons surrounding the nuclei. The shielding effect is sensitive to chemical environments, hence allowing the characteristic identification of specific molecular functional groups [
