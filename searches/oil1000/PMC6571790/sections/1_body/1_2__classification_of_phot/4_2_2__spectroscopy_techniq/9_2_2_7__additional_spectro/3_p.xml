<p class="p">The J-coupling phenomenon is also known as indirect (scalar) spin-spin coupling. This coupling effect results in splitting of spectroscopic lines into multiplets. The J-coupling occurs between two nuclei or groups of nuclei and is governed by the polarization of electrons on the chemical bonds connecting these nuclei. The polarization scheme is in turn dependent on the instant orientation of the nuclear magnetic moments in the presence of a magnetic field [
