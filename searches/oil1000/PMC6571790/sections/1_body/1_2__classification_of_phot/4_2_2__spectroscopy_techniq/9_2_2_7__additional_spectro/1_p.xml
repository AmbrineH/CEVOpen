<p class="p">Apart from the popular spectroscopy techniques discussed earlier, existing studies presented additional variations of spectroscopy techniques which may be more complex in nature. For instance, dielectric spectroscopy has been utilized in agricultural inspections. Dielectric spectroscopy involves the inspection of dielectric properties or permittivity of samples over broad frequency ranges. Dielectric properties or permittivity refers to the ability of samples to store electrical energy in the electric field. In this spectroscopy technique, the permittivity is a complex permittivity relative to the free space, and this complex number is represented by (3):

The NMR spectroscopy gains spectral information of samples from the interaction between the magnetic moments of nuclei of various atoms and the applied magnetic fields. The two common phenomena that give rise to the NMR spectra are chemical shift and J-coupling [
