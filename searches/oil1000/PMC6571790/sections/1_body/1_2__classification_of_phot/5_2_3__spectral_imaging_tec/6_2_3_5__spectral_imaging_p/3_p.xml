<p class="p">The next step in the analysis flow will be image segmentation. Image segmentation serves to divide the pre-processed spectral image into different regions for the identification of region of interests (ROIs) [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In this process, segmentation algorithms are greatly preferred over manual segmentation due to the ease of operation and time saving. The selections of segmentation algorithms include thresholding (global thresholding or adaptive thresholding), morphological processing (erosion, dilation, open, close or watershed algorithm), edge-based segmentation (gradient-based or Laplacian-based methods) and spectral image segmentation [
