<p class="p">The raw spectral image data obtained via the spectral imaging technique comes in different formats according to the image acquisition method used. The common formats are Band interleaved by pixel (BIP), band interleaved by line (BIL) and band sequential (BSQ). The BIP format results from the point scan method and stores the complete spectrum of each pixel sequentially. The BIL format comes with the line scan method and stores the complete spectrum of each line in order. Lastly, the BSQ format relates to the area scan method and stacks the spatial image continuously obtained at each wavelength [
