<p class="p">Spatial analysis utilizing spectral image data usually involves quantitative measurement. In this process, gray-level object measurement is performed to quantify the intensity distribution of ROI extracted from image segmentation. Gray-level object measurements can be categorized according to intensity-based or texture-based measurements [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Intensity-based measurements are usually first-order measures such as mean [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], standard deviation, skew, energy and entropy [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Meanwhile, texture-based measurements are second-order measures such as joint distribution functions [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] and 2-D Gabor filter [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>].
