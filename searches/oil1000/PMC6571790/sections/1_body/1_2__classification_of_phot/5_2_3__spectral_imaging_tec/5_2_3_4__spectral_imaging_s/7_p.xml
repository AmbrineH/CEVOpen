<p class="p">Unlike the electronically tunable filter, a beam splitting device allows spectral images to be obtained simultaneously at multiple wavelengths. The beam splitting device divides light into several parts and passes them through bandpass filters which correspond to the required wavelengths. The beam splitting device can be categorized into color splitting and neutral splitting. In color splitting, light rays at a particular waveband are directed to each output, whereas, in neutral splitting, an equal portion of the total light energy is directed to each output [
