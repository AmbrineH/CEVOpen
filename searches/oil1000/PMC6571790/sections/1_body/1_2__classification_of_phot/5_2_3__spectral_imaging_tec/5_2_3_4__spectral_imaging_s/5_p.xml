<p class="p">Compared to traditional spectrograph, an imaging spectrograph extracts both spatial and spectral information. The imaging spectrograph disperses the broadband light illuminated onto different spatial areas of a sample into different wavelengths. This is achieved through diffraction gratings. The two most popular imaging spectrographs are the prism-grating-prism (PGP) imaging spectrograph which uses transmission diffraction gratings and the Offner imaging spectrograph that uses reflection diffraction gratings [
