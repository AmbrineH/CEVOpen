<p class="p">A CCD camera is made up of millions of photodiodes (pixels) that are closely arranged to form an array. These light sensitive photodiodes convert the incident photons into electric charges that correspond to the intensity of the exposed incident rays. The accumulated electric charges at each photodiode will then be moved out of the array to be quantified for spectral image formation [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. One of the common CCD cameras is the silicon CCD camera. The silicon CCD camera exploits the sensitivity of silicon under visible light to perform image acquisition in visible and short-wavelength near-infrared bands [

Not least, mercury cadmium telluride (MCT or HgCdTe) CCD camera built from HgCdTe, an alloy between mercury telluride (HgTe) and cadmium telluride (CdTe), enables sensing in the long-wavelength near-infrared and mid-infrared band [
