<p class="p">The core component of the spectral imaging system is the wavelength dispersive device. A wavelength dispersive device disperses broadband light into different wavelengths to be projected to the area detector. Examples of wavelength dispersive devices include the imaging spectrograph, electronically tunable filter and beam splitting device [
