<p class="p">An electronically tunable filter utilizes electronic devices to extract the required wavelength. Current electronically tunable filters can be categorized into the acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) and liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF). An AOTF utilizes an acoustic transducer to generate high frequency acoustic waves that change the refractive index of a crystal. The crystal with varied refractive index will only allow the passage of light rays at the specified wavelength. Meanwhile, a LCTF transmits light at the required wavelength through electronically controlled liquid crystal cells [
