<p class="p">The light source for a spectral imaging system can be classified into illumination and excitation sources. Illumination light source is selected when measurements involve changes in the intensity of the incident rays upon light-sample interaction. The spectral composition of the incident source will not experience any changes. Such interaction is commonly observed in reflectance and transmittance sensing modes. Broadband lights are normally used as illumination sources. An example of illumination light source is the quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) lamp which is capable of generating a smooth spectrum in the visible to infrared range. Besides, the broadband light emitting diode (LED) has gained popularity over time due to its low power consumption, low heat generation, small size and long lifetime [
