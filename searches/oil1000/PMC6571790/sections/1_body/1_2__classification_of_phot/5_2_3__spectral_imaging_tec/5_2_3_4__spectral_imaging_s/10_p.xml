<p class="p">Comparatively, the CMOS camera is similar to the CCD camera by having a collection of photodiodes (pixels) that convert light rays into electrical charges. The difference, however, lies in the quantification process of the electric charges. Opposed to the remote quantification in the CCD camera, the CMOS camera allows electric charges at each pixel to be independently and instantaneously read by the transistor attached to each photodiode [

This unique characteristic allows the CMOS camera to compete with the CCD camera in terms of high imaging acquisition speed, blooming immunity, low cost, low power consumption and small size. However, careful note should be taken as the CMOS camera is susceptible to noise due to on-chip signal transmissions, resulting in lower sensitivity and dynamic range when pitted against CCD camera [
