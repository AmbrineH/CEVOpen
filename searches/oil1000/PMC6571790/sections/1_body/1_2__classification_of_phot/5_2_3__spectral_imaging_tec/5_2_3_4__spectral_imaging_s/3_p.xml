<p class="p">Excitation light source is usually selected when measurements involve changes in the frequency and wavelength of the incident rays. Interactions of this nature usually involve fluorescence phenomenon or Raman scattering effect. Narrowband lights are frequently used as excitation sources. A popular excitation light source is the laser which generates powerful monochromatic rays. Not least, UV fluorescent lamp, narrowband LED, high-pressure arc lamp (xeon arc lamp) and low-pressure vapor lamp (mercury vapor lamp) add to the family of excitation light sources [
