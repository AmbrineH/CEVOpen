<p class="p">However, the spectral imaging technique does pose several limitations. Hardware speed is a major concern, especially in the case of hyperspectral imaging, due to the massive amounts of data to be acquired and analyzed. Moreover, spectral imaging includes the acquisition of redundant data, resulting in complex data analysis. Spectral imaging systems too require constant calibration in order to maintain their efficiency. The detection limits of spectral imaging are poorer compared to chemical-based analytical methods. Similar to spectroscopy, spectral imaging suffers from multicollinearity and requires multivariate analysis to address the issue. In addition, spectral imaging is inapplicable when the ROI is smaller than the size of a pixel or does not exhibit the characteristic spectral absorption. Lastly, spectral imaging may be irrelevant in the analysis of liquids and homogeneous samples since these samples do not pose distinctive and useful spatial information [
