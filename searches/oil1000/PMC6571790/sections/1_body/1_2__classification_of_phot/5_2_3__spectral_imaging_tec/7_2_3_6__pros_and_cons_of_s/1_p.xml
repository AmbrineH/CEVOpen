<p class="p">This technique is advantageous as it omits chemical processes and requires minimum sample preparation. Moreover, the composition of multiple components in a sample can be simultaneously obtained. Upon spectral image acquisition, spectral imaging too allows the flexible selection of region of interest (ROI) for analysis. Furthermore, owing to the rich spatial and spectral information, spectral imaging can easily detect and differentiate subjects even though similar colors, overlapping spectra and morphological characteristics are present [
