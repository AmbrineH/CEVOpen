<p class="p">The area scan (band sequential) method, on the other hand, acquires a 2-D grayscale image comprising of complete spatial information in a single wavelength. A complete hyperspectral cube is generated through image stacking when scans are performed along the spectral axis (Î»). The nature of the area scan method makes it more suited for the imaging of stationary samples instead of moving samples. In short, among the image acquisition methods discussed, line scan and area scan are greatly preferred over point scan for both hyperspectral and multispectral imaging on the basis of time consumption [
