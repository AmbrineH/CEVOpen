<p class="p">The line scan (pushbroom) method, in each scan, acquires a slit (line) of spatial information together with the spectrum of every pixel along the line. A complete hyperspectral cube will be formed when scans are repeated along the direction of motion (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>). The operation characteristic of the line scan method makes it suitable to acquire spectral images of moving samples. Hence, this method is usually combined with conveyor belt systems, making it a popular method in practical production lines. However, the exposure time should be short and accurately selected to allow uniform exposure at all wavelengths [
