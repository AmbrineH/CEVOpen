<p class="p">There are several methods in which spectral imaging systems acquire spectral images. The methods are point scan, line scan and area scan as illustrated in

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The point scan (whiskbroom) method acquires the spectrum of a single pixel in each scan. A complete hyperspectral cube will be generated as the detector moves from pixel to pixel along the two spatial axes (x and y). The point scan method is similar to a normal spectroscopic approach. Since it cannot cover a large sample area, the point scan method is time consuming and unsuitable for fast image acquisition [
