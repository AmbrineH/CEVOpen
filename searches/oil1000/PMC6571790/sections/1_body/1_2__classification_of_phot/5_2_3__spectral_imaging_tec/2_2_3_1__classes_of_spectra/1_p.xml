<p class="p">The spectral imaging technique acquires multiple images of the same subject at varying wavelengths. The resulting spectral images are three-dimensional (3-D) in nature, consisting of two spatial dimensions (row, x, and column, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, Î»). Variations of spectral imaging technique are determined by the continuity of data in the wavelength dimension, branching out into hyperspectral imaging and multispectral imaging [
