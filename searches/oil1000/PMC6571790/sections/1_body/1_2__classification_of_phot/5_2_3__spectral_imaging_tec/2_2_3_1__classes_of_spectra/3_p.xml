<p class="p">Multispectral imaging acquires spectral images at a significantly smaller number compared to hyperspectral imaging. Spectral images will only be acquired at optimal wavelengths predetermined from the analysis of dataset obtained through hyperspectral imaging. A smaller number of interested wavelengths allows rapid image acquisition and requires simpler image analysis algorithms. This characteristic of optimum data volume makes multispectral imaging perfectly suited for real-time in-field applications [
