<p class="p">In general, hyperspectral imaging obtains spectral images in continuous wavelengths, whereas multispectral imaging registers spectral images at discrete wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging acquires large number of images at high spatial and spectral resolutions. Due to the high volume of data, hyperspectral imaging requires long image acquisition time and involves complex algorithms for image analysis. Despite the complexity, hyperspectral imaging is essential for fundamental research and is the basis for multispectral imaging [
