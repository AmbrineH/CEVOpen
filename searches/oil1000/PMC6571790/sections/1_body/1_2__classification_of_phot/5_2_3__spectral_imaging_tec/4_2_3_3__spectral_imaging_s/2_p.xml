<p class="p">The transmittance mode operates by having the detector collect light rays transmitted through inspected samples. In this sensing mode, the light source and the detector will be placed in opposite direction to each other. Due to the absorption of light rays in a sample, the detected signal will be relatively weak and dependent on sample thickness. Hence, the transmittance mode is commonly applied in the internal inspection of relatively transparent samples [
