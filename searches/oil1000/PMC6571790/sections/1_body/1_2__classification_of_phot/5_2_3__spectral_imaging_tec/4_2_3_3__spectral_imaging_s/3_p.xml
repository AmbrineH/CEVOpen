<p class="p">Meanwhile, the interactance mode overcomes the limitations of both the reflectance and transmittance modes. This sensing mode exhibits less surface effect compared to reflectance mode. At the same time, it allows detection in deeper layers of a sample without being affected by sample thickness as in transmittance mode. This advantageous sensing mode is set up by installing the light source and the detector at the same side and parallel to each other [
