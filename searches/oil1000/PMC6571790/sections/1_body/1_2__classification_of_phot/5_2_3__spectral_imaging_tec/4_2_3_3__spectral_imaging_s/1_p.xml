<p class="p">Spectral imaging may have varying sensing modes as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02025-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. The sensing modes are determined by the positions of the light source and the detector, forming variations such as reflectance, transmittance and interactance modes. In reflectance mode, the detector collects the light reflected off the illuminated surface. This sensing mode is suitable for identifying external features of samples such as size, shape, color, texture and defects. However, when selecting this mode, the detector should be properly positioned to avoid specular reflection [
