 <xref rid="molecules-24-02025-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> presents a simple comparison of the optics and photonics techniques in agriculture that have been discussed earlier. From the comparison, the imaging technique is noted to be utilized for the extraction of spatial information only and is sensitive to small-sized objects. In contrast to the imaging technique, the spectroscopy technique allows acquisition of spectral information and is useful in accessing multi-constituent information. The spectral imaging technique covers the benefits of both imaging and spectroscopy techniques, allowing it to obtain spectral and spatial information simultaneously. Apart from this, spectral imaging has the added value of flexible spectral extraction as well as the capability of generating quality-attribute distribution. However, it should be noted that multispectral imaging has poorer access to spectral information compared to hyperspectral imaging due to the acquisition at limited number of wavelengths. Among the compared techniques, the spectral imaging technique can be said to be the most robust. Nonetheless, the area of application should be given the utmost consideration when selecting the best optics and photonic technique in order to avoid the underutilization or overutilization of a particular technique [
