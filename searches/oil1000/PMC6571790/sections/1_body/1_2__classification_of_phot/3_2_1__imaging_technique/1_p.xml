 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] information of the subject of interest. Therefore, imaging techniques are typically operated in an active manner. The active imaging technique involves image acquisition under two major light sources, namely visible light and infrared sources. Images under visible light can be easily acquired with any standard camera modules. On the other hand, images under exposure to infrared can be acquired with special infrared camera modules [
