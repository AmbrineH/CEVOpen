<p class="p">The imaging technique can be easily applied in the simple analysis of static-positioned objects or even in more complex areas which involve moving targets, such as visual navigation and behavioral surveillance. These achievements were made possible by utilizing the spatial information acquired through the imaging technique for position triangulation and motion guidance [
