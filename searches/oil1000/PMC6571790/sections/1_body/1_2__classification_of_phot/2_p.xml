<p class="p">As a result, modern technology has been integrated into the agricultural field to maximize output efficiency at minimum labor force. Similar to other industries, automation systems have been applied in stages of agricultural activities to reduce a dependency on manual labor [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. These systems require optics and photonics techniques to complement them, providing the required ‘sight’ for operations. These vision requirements have been fulfilled by optics and photonic techniques such as imaging, and spectral imaging. These techniques provide machine vision at high dynamic range, high resolution and high accuracy in a non-destructive, non-contact and robust manner [
