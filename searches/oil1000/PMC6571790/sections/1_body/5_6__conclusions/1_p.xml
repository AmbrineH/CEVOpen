<p class="p">In conclusion, optics and photonics exhibit great benefits if they are integrated into the agricultural industry. A complete knowledge of the behaviors and properties of light upon light-material interaction allows the quantitative and qualitative analysis of agriculture products. In general, optics and photonic techniques for agricultural purposes can be categorized into imaging, spectroscopy and spectral imaging techniques. The imaging technique is effective in collecting spatial, color and thermal information, whereas the spectroscopy technique is essential for collecting spectral information. Meanwhile, spectral imaging is a combination of both imaging and spectroscopy techniques, allowing the collection of a complete data set. These three optics and photonic techniques have been utilized in agriculture categories such as fruits, vegetables, grain, meat, dairy produce, oil, beverages, and commercial crops, as well as farm and plantation management. These works can be referred to and emulated in the agriculture industry of tropical countries, especially in agriculture activities related to oil palm, rubber and agro-food crops. However, challenges in terms of public acceptance, finance and technical support should be overcome before achieving a complete integration of optics and photonics techniques in the agriculture industry.</p>
