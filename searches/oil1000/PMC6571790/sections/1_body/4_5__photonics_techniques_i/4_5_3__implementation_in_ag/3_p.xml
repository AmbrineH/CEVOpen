<p class="p">At the same time, all three optics and photonic techniques discussed earlier can be fully utilized to inspect the harvested organic fruits and vegetables for quality evaluation. For instance, imaging in either VIS or IR region is useful in detecting external damage or bruises in mangosteens, wax jambus, cherry tomatoes and more. Spectroscopy may be performed as well to inspect internal features or maturity of fruits and vegetables. Not least, spectral imaging may be considered when spatial and spectral information are required simultaneously for quality evaluation. Meanwhile, the quality inspection of meat products, such as chicken, beef, lamb, and fish among others, is strongly preferred to be performed using spectroscopy or spectral imaging. These two techniques are suitable for identifying the microbial spoilage of meat products due to their ability to obtain spectral information. With the integration and application of optics and photonics in the agriculture industry, it is anticipated that the agricultural products in the tropical countries will meet the public expectation of higher food quality.</p>
