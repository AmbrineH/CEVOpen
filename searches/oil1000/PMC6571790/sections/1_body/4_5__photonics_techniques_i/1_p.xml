<p class="p">Blessed with wide spans of fertile soil, rich marine ecology, abundant rainfall and a tropical climate, tropical countries are exceptionally suited for a myriad of agricultural activities [

This sector also provides income to farmers, raising their living standards in rural areas. An example of tropical countries with active agricultural activities is Malaysia. Dating back to the early years following Malaysia’s independence in 1957, the agriculture sector has been a signifficant driver towards socio-economic development in Malaysia. However, in the early 1980s, the growth of the agricultural field came to an abrupt halt due to the sharp decline in commodity prices, limited technical specialty, volatile rubber prices and lack of incentives [

 <xref rid="B231-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">231</xref>]. Since then, agriculture has always been a major agenda item of Malaysian economic plans, with a recent target directed towards modernizing agriculture as drafted in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan [

Apart from Malaysia, other tropical countries such as Indonesia and Thailand are also actively involved in agriculture activities. The following sections will discuss some of the agricultural crops in tropical countries in which optics and photonic techniques can be easily integrated for automated plantation management, yield increment, quality inspection and disease control.
