<p class="p">Meanwhile, the spectroscopy technique can be utilized in the later rubber processing stages. The first application would be rubber quality grading. For instance, cup lump raw rubber, which is an important material in tires, seal strips, conveyor belts and other moulded rubber products, can be graded by using VIS-NIR spectroscopy to inspect the moisture content of the rubber. This spectroscopic approach is fast, accurate and more reliable compared to manual inspection through sight and touch [

Lastly, spectroscopy variations, such as NIR-MIR, Raman, dielectric or NMR, can be opted to study the structure and properties of rubber during vulcanization. Such studies allow the analysis and selection of accelerators, activators and retarders, leading to improved characteristics in the vulcanized rubber and an optimized vulcanizing process [
