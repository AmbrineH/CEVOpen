<p class="p">Another area in which optics and photonics techniques may be applied for oil palm activities is disease detection. The most devastating diseases that attack palm oil plantations in South East Asia are basal stem rot (BSR) and upper stem rot (USR). These diseases result in certain death of oil palms if not controlled effectively, resulting in yield loss and disrupting the plantation cycle. These fatal diseases are identified to be caused by the

 <italic class="italic">G. boninense</italic>) fungus. However, the identification of the root cause of these diseases is still insufficient as they cannot be controlled even with the slightest delay in infection detection [
