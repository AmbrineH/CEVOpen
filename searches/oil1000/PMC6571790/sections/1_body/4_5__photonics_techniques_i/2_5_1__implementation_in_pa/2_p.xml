<p class="p">The implementation of optics and photonics techniques in oil palm related activities can start from the development of agriculture robots. The development of an agriculture robot involves the implementation of the imaging technique in its operation. Spatial and color information attained by the agriculture robot through the imaging technique will greatly improve the efficiency of palm oil plantation management. Automated palm oil fruit harvest is potentially applicable by pinpointing the fruit position as presented in [
