<p class="p">In addition, palm oil quality is governed by fatty acid, moisture and peroxide contents. Microbial or oxidation reactions that take place during the storage of oil palm fruit may modify these contents, resulting in a depreciation of palm oil quality [
 <xref rid="B235-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">235</xref>]. Under common operations, palm oil plantations are usually distanced further away from refinery factories. Bulk transport of palm fruit upon reaching the necessary processing quota is often practiced for cost savings. As a result, palm fruits that have been harvested earlier will be stored in dedicated storage spaces. The time difference between harvesting and processing greatly increases the risk for microbial or oxidation reaction to take place. In this scenario, spectroscopy or spectral imaging can be implemented in the palm oil extraction stage to perform oil quality segregation. This will greatly prevent contamination of low-quality palm oil in further downstream processes, promoting process efficiency and increasing palm oil yield.
