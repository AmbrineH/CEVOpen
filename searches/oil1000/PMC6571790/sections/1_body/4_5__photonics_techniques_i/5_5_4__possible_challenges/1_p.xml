<p class="p">The prevailing research challenges of integrating optics and photonics techniques into the agriculture field are the reliability issue of the laser source and sensor, effect of the ambient environmental condition into optics system, and expensive semiconductor materials at operating wavelength from short to mid-IR range. First and foremost, the illumination intensity of the laser and the sensitivity of the sensor may change over time, which leads to the need for recalibration of the system. Therefore, more research is required in terms of the design and fabrication of a more reliable laser source, sensor and optical detector. In addition, the effect of the ambient condition such as humidity, surrounding temperature, and dust particles could be a hindrance in ensuring consistent results obtained from the optical system. Hence, research into the minimization of these effects on the optical system is significant to improve the system performance such as higher sensitivity, lower systematic error and maintenance rate. Moreover, silicon is well-known for its optimum wavelength operation below 1000 nm. From short to mid-IR range, examples of more viable semiconductor materials are gallium antimonide and indium gallium arsenide. The investigation in terms of generating a higher efficiency using these materials for a cost-effective solution creates the research opportunities for further exploration in both simulation and experimental works. </p>
