<p class="p">Apart from the research challenges, the main challenge in introducing the discussed optics and photonic techniques into the field of agriculture in tropical countries would be gaining the acceptance of farmers, fisherman and smallholders. The introduction of modern technology and new agriculture practices often raises concerns surrounding their technical and economic feasibilities. Farm and plantation owners will prefer traditional agriculture practices as newly introduced technologies are often regarded to be more suited to a controlled laboratory environment. In this scenario, technology vendors should ensure that complete field testing has been done in the environment where the technology will be introduced. A probationary period may also be set to allow owners to try out and experience the benefits brought forth by the proposed technologies.</p>
