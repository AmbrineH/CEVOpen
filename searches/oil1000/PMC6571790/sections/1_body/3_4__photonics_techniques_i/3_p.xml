<p class="p">In addition, food preservative exceeding the allowable limit has been a critical issue in ensuring the health of the public. Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) is commonly used as an antioxidant agent in canned food or bottled beverages. Several optical sensing techniques such as optical spectroscopy and fluorescence may be able to detect the concentration of BHT. BHT is also commonly known as 2,6-ditertiarybutyl-para-cresol (DBPC). Recently, Leong et al. [
 <xref rid="B224-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">224</xref>] reported the detection of DBPC in transformer oil using optical spectroscopy at waveband near to 1403 nm. This opens up the opportunity of detecting the concentration of BHT in canned food or bottled beverages, leading to an online monitoring system that uses the optical spectroscopy method.
