<p class="p">Due to the lack of attention paid during the preparation processes or due to the contamination of water and environment, hazardous residual materials are occasionally found in food. These hazardous materials include heavy metal, pesticides and antibiotics. Conventionally, the screening process or food safety inspections were carried out using laboratory-based equipment or measurement methods such as gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography [

In this context, optical detection methods such as optical spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence can be explored for their possible utilization in the online monitoring of food products in order to ensure that they are free of hazardous residual materials.
