<p class="p">Photonics and optics have also recently gained popularity in the quality inspection of food product. This is because food inspection in the production line needs to be carried out at fast speed and a very fast monitoring system is needed. Food inspection can become even more challenging when it is dealing with large quantities of sample moving very quickly on the conveyor belt. Therefore, high speed and high sensitivity optical system will be very suitable for the online monitoring and inspection of food product. For example, research work on UV-visible-NIR optical spectroscopy have been carried out extensively in the monitoring of extra virgin olive oil [

 <xref rid="B220-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>], tea [
 <xref rid="B221-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">221</xref>], dairy product [
 <xref rid="B222-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">222</xref>] and alcoholic beverages [
 <xref rid="B223-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">223</xref>]. However, as these works focus on wavebands below 1100 nm, the results and consistency of the conclusions may be easily affected by ambient lighting conditions and the change in color of the beverages or product. Therefore, more research work shall be carried out to characterize these food products in the NIR (&gt;1100 nm) and MIR wavebands in order to obtain the optical “fingerprint” that correlates to the quality and food safety level of the product.
