<p class="p">This paper aims to review some of the most popular optics and photonic techniques in agriculture, namely imaging, spectroscopy and spectral imaging. In addition, existing applications of each technique in the agricultural industry will also be compiled. A comprehensive discussion will also be made to gauge the potential of exploiting optics and photonic techniques in the agricultural sector with the intention of improving the quality and productivity of the agricultural products at a reduced labor cost.</p>
