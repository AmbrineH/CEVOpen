<p class="p">Amidst the modern and complex solutions discussed earlier, it often slipped our minds that optics and photonics can be readily integrated into the field of agriculture. The simplest examples would be the adjustment of plantation direction for optimum sunlight exposure, as well as the usage of incandescent light bulbs in egg incubation and hatching [
