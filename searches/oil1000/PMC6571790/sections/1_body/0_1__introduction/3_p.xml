<p class="p">Optics and photonics have influenced various engineering applications, transforming the landscape of various fields and improving the lives of mankind. One of the main applications of optics and photonics can be seen in the field of communications. Knowledge of optics and photonics has been used to develop optical fibers which help to cater for the needs of broadband Internet service in this “data hungry” era. Furthermore, optics and photonics have been used in the manufacturing of modern displays such as liquid crystal display (LCD), organic light-emitting diode (OLED), flexible display and such. Solar cells for energy harnessing too illustrate another application of optics and photonics. Not least, optics and photonics have also been applied in more sophisticated areas such as security surveillance, medical imaging, quantum computing and more [
