<p class="p">Optics can be defined as a branch of physics that studies the behavior and properties of light as well as the interaction of light with other matter [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Despite the distinction between optics and photonics, both terminologies have often been used interchangeably in the literature to collectively represent the science and application of light [
