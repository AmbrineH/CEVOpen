 <xref rid="B116-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>], vegetables [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>], and meat [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>,
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>] can be easily inspected using spectroscopy as well. For instance, two wavelengths within 600 to 904 nm of VIS-NIR spectrum are investigated by correlation analysis to discriminate brown core and sound pears [
 <xref rid="B115-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. Using eight brown core pears and 32 sound pears, the percentage of soluble solid content achieves a precision of 97.8% and 99% within a standard deviation of 0.5% and 1%, respectively. In addition, NIR spectrum and PLS regression model are used to detect the total anthocyanins content (TAC) and total phenolic compounds (TPC) in jambu fruits [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>]. With a total of 50 jambu samples scanning from 1000 to 2400 nm, the correlation coefficients of TAC and TPC are deduced as 0.98 and 0.94, and strong ratio to performance of deviation as 5.19 and 3.27, respectively. Besides that, a 250 to 350 GHz radiation is found to be suitable to distinguish the defective and proper sugar beet seeds [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. A python package scikit-learn algorithm is used to determine the threshold for these two types of seeds, with 80% detection for proper seed and 94% detection for defective seed. Therefore, the average detection rate of this algorithm is 87%. In addition, meat fraud is injected into bovine meat, aiming to increase the water holding capacity. This issue is characterized with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrum and the supervision of the 55 meat fraud adulterated samples through PLS square discriminant analysis [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>]. The analysis records a precise detection as high as 91% of the adulterated samples. Apart from meat fraud, the freshness of mackerel fish is characterized with auto-fluorescence spectroscopy and analyzed with fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEM) [
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. The fluorescence EEM data and real freshness values are modelled with PLS regression and an algorithm is developed for this smart system as a predictor with squared correlation coefficient of 0.89.
