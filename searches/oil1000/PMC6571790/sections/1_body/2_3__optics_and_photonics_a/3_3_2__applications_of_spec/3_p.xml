 <xref rid="B123-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>] can be easily identified, leading to easy detection on contamination of agricultural product. Residual pesticides such as phosmet and thiabendazole in apples are analyzed with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with gold nanoparticle [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. The sensitivities for detectable concentration are 0.5 µg/g for phosmet and 0.1 µg/g for thiabendazole. The PLS regression is also used to correlate the SERS spectrum with the concentration of pesticide in apples with squared correlation coefficient of 0936 for phosmet and 0.959 for thiabendazole. In addition, the effect of drying temperature on the nitrogen detection in soils at four different temperatures of 25 °C for placement, 50, 80, and 95 °C for drying is modelled based on NIR sensor and three successive algorithms, which are multiple linear regression, PLS, and competitive adaptive reweighed square on the spectral information [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. Based on the three soil samples, loess, calcium soil, and black soil show the correlation coefficients of 0.9721, 0.9588, and 0.9486, respectively at the optimum drying temperature of 80°C. The detection of nitrogen in three types of soils is also alternatively performed in [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>], with squared correlation coefficients of 0.95, 0.96 and 0.79 for loess, calcium soil and black soil using PLS regression model. The relatively lower squared correlation coefficient in black soil is due to the interference of high humus content and strong absorption of organic matter in black soil. Lastly, a point worth noting is that the dielectric and NMR spectroscopy are often adopted when the analysis involves more complex chemical compounds [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>,
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. These complex chemical compounds include the vulcanization of natural rubber with sulfur-cured and peroxide-cured systems with different dynamics [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>] and detection to changes in concentrations of pollutants in agriculture drainage such as heavy metal and heavy oxides [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. In [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>] a sulphur-cured system has features restricted segmented dynamics whereas peroxide-cured system has faster dynamics. In addition, network structure resulting from the vulcanization of both systems also influences the segmental dynamics of natural rubber. The peroxide-cured network is more homogeneous with spatial distribution of cross links than the sulphur-cured network with large inhomogeneity due to the presence of zinc oxide particles and the ionic interaction with the natural rubber chains. In [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>], an X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy is employed to investigate the changes of pollutants in dried root and shoot plant parts at a temperature range from 30 to 90 °C. From the measurement, the concentration of pollutant is found to be higher in plant root than plant shoot through the analysis of frequency relaxation process via dielectric modulus measurement. Significantly, the removal of pollutants by plants will be enhanced upon subjecting them to a microwave heating power of 400 W for 30 min. Apart from the aforementioned applications, more applications of the spectroscopy technique in agricultural products with different methods and wavelengths are tabulated in
