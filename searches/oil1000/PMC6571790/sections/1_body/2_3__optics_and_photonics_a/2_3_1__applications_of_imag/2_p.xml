 <xref rid="molecules-24-02025-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, bruise detection, yield estimation, and disease identification are the three most common applications with imaging technique in agriculture. In bruise detection, a hyperspectral camera with broad operating wavelength from 400 to 5000 nm [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] are employed for yield estimation. However, the grading machine proposed in [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] has a small capacity in estimation for 300 tomatoes per hour and does not efficiently work for tomato images with high specular reflection. In addition, infrared thermography is a popular device for disease identification due to its non-invasive monitoring and indirect visualization of downy mildew development [
