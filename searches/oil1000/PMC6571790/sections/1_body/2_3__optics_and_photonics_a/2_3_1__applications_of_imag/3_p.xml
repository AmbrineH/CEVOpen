<p class="p">Apart from the instrument, numerous types of algorithms are depicted in imaging technique. In bruise detection, PCA and a minimum noise fraction are proposed for 20 apple samples with threshold percentages of success within 86% to 93% and 87% to 97%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. In yield estimation, the fruit detection algorithm is presented for 8â€“120 apple samples with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.83 to 0.88 [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. In addition, the blob detector neural network is demonstrated to detect the yield estimation for both oranges and apples with intersection over union of 81.3% for orange and 83.8% for apple [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. As for disease identification, a simple linear iterative clustering algorithm is presented for 3624 foliar images with high classification rate of 98.34% for height between 1 to 2 m [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. The classification rate is reduced for approximately 2% for each meter from the examined height within 1 to 16 m. Moreover, an improved GoogLeNet and Cifar10 models are established for 500 images of maize leaf disease with 4:1 ratio for training and validation which allows the system to have a diversity of sample conditions [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. The average identification accuracy of GoogLeNet and Cifar10 models is recorded as high as 98.9% and 98.8%, respectively. Apart from bruise detection, yield estimation, and disease identification, algorithms are also shown in maturity evaluation and acquisition of crop segmentation. In maturity evaluation, both a Fuzzy model [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] and medium filter algorithm [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] are employed for 3108 images on banana samples and 100 images on tomato samples with an average identification rate of 93.11%, and within 89% to 98%, respectively. The Fuzzy model is useful in handling ambiguous information for the banana fruit maturity detection using red-green-blue (RGB) components. In the acquisition of crop segmentation, K-mean clustering algorithm is presented for a clustering of apple samples with target acquisition rate of 84% [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. This algorithm is commonly used in image segmentation whereby crop segmentation can be precisely attained, even with the presence of stems and leaves in the captured images.
