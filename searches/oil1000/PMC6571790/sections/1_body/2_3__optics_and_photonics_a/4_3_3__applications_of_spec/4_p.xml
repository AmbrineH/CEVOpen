<p class="p">For the quality evaluation of agriculture product, the firmness test for two types of apple fruits is conducted with a laser-based multispectral imaging prototype which captures and processes four spectral scattering images at a speed of two fruits per second [
 <xref rid="B169-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>]. The multilinear regression models are developed using to predict the firmness of those two apple types at 680, 880, 905, and 940 nm with a correlation coefficient of 0.86. The quality of grape berries is determined by the reflectance spectrum from a hyperspectral imaging system, whilst the high reflectance at 500 nm, 660 to 700 nm, and 840 nm denotes the chlorophyll content, red-coloured anthocyanin pigment, and sugar content, respectively [
 <xref rid="B170-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>]. A partial least square regression (PLSR) model is applied in order to determine the correlation between the spectral information and the physico-chemical indices. The titratable acidity of the green and black grapes shows a coefficient of determination of 0.95 and 0.82, as well as soluble solid content of 0.94 and 0.93 at pH value of 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. The root mean square error for this method is 0.06 for green grape and 0.25 for black grape. Apart from fruits, the quality of tea leaves is classified by a hyperspectral imaging sensor at 762, 793, and 838 nm, supported by SVM algorithm [
 <xref rid="B171-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>]. Within 700 samples comprising of 500 training samples and 200 prediction sets, the SVM algorithm generates a total classification rate of 98% the training sample and 95% for the prediction set, at result of optimal regularization parameter of 4.37349 and kernel parameter of 13.2131 in SVM model.
