<p class="p">For the maturity evaluation of agriculture products such as peach fruit, a CCD camera is employed at 450, 675 and 800 nm, whereas the fruit ripening is characterized with the increasing in intensity from a histogram with a ratio of red divide with infrared red (R/IR) [
 <xref rid="B164-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">164</xref>]. The firmness of the peach fruit reduces when the reflectance at 675 nm is increased. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) is presented to access the R/IR clustering which has the highest reflectance at 675 nm, and higher Fisher value as a function of higher R/IR ratio. Apart from the detection of maturity for peach fruit, the maturity stage of strawberry is detected using a hyperspectral imaging system from 380 to 1030 nm and from 874 to 1734 nm [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. According to the PCA, the optimal wavelengths are from 441.1 to 1013.97 nm and from 941.46 to 1578.13 nm with a classification accuracy of above 85%. Moreover, the maturity of tomato is detected by an electromagnetic spectrum with a continuous 257 bands from 396 to 736 nm [
 <xref rid="B166-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>] and discrete band of 530, 595, 630, and 850 nm using a tomato maturity predictive sensor [
 <xref rid="B167-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. Based on the LDA, the classification error is reduced from 51% to 19% [
 <xref rid="B166-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>] and achieves detection accuracy above 85% [
 <xref rid="B167-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. The ripening in banana fruit is also characterized with a compact imaging system and an UAV from 500 to 700 nm [
 <xref rid="B168-molecules-24-02025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">168</xref>]. The detection is based on the reflectance spectrum whereby in ripe banana, the main element is carotenoid which absorbs less light at 650 nm band. On the other hand, a green banana with a greater amount of chlorophyll than ripe banana absorbs more light at 650 nm band.
