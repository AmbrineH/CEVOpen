<p id="Par4" class="p">The essential objective of the present research was to compare the properties of edible films formed by different methods for better delivery of Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and analyze the influence and interaction of macromolecular nutrient complexes on edible film. In this study, we used geltain-chitosan as the wall material and mixed or embedded docosahexaenoic acids powders as the core material, using casting, electrospinning, and coaxial electrospinning to form 5 different films. The structure and physicochemical properties were analyzed and studied to provide a scientific basis for the development and utilization of a new gelatin edible film and for industrial application.</p>
