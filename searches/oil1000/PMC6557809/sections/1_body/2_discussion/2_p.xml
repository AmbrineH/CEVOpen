<p id="Par13" class="p">In the current study, the effect of different production methods on the color of gelatin-chitosan film was significantly different in the experiment as shown in Table. 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> (P &lt; 0.05). The L*, a*, b*, and ΔE* of the composite film after adding DAS were significantly different from those of films without DAS. The sensory properties and acceptance of food are affected by color. It can be concluded that the difference between the L* and ΔE* values depends on the processing conditions

 </sup>. All DHA-enriched films’ luminance value were higher than those of other films when the luminance control value was formed by electrospinning (

Brightness is an important edible film color parameter affected by the DHA source type compound, and the form of the biologically active ingredient determines this difference. However, the possibility of using DHA source components to achieve higher L* values or brighter edible film output can be considered an advantage
