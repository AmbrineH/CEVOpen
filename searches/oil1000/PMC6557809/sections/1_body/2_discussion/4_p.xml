 </sup>. The mechanical strength of the edible film was studied to assess the processing performance and to reveal further information about internal structures. There was a significant difference in tensile strength between GC-C and GC-DC, and the tensile strength decreased with the addition of DAS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>). This phenomenon may be due to the immiscibility and microphase separation of the mixture, resulting in easier chain slip under load and less physical entanglement interaction between polymer chains. Complex materials had mesoscopic microphase-separated structures, which were different from ordinary single-crystal or polycrystalline materials. Their performance depended not only on the properties of the molecule, but more importantly on the self-assembly of the molecules and the formation of microphase-separated structures from the nanometer to micrometer scale, which may be the deeper reason for the difference. Unlike other methods of adding DAS, coaxial electrospinning had the same effect as without DAS. It should be mentioned that the mechanical strength of the electrospun films was weaker than that of the casting films. The result was the same as other have authors’ reported
