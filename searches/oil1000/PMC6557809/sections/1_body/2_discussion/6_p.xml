<p id="Par17" class="p">X-ray diffraction analysis is a method of analyzing the internal atomic space structure of a substance by utilizing the diffraction effect of X-rays in the crystal material. However, the crystallinity of the film formed by electrospinning was significantly lower than that of the film formed by casting, and the film formed by coaxial electrospinning had the lowest crystallinity. Moreover, that of the film with DAS added was significantly lower than that of the film without DAS under the same conditions, indicating that the addition of DAS may reduce the crystallinity of the gelatin-chitosan film. The reduced peak intensity may be due to intermolecular crystal between the hydroxyl group of the DAS gelatin and NH
