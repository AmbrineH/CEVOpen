 </sup>. The amide I band is acute changes in the protein secondary structure region, and the amide II band is the torsional vibration peak of the α-helix, β-sheet, corner, and random coil; amides I and II reflect the degree of cross-linking between the peptide chains: the tighter the peptide chain binding, the greater the frequency of vibration. Moreover, the amide III band reflects whether the protein maintains a complete triple helix structure.
