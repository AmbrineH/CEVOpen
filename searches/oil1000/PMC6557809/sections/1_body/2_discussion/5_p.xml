<p id="Par16" class="p">The melting temperature of the films corresponded to the dissociation of polymer chains. The endothermic peaks in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> mainly reflected the destruction of the hydrogen bond between gelatin molecules and the physical crosslink formed between chitosan and gelatin and DAS and the rearrangement of the gelatin’s triple helix structure. Compared to the electrospinning process, the solvent casting had a similar melting temperature, with a small gap. Higher than the melting temperature of the report of Hosseini

 </sup>. The endothermic peaks in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> mainly indicate destruction of the physical hydrogen bonds between the chitosan molecules and the physical crosslinking formed between the mixtures and the rearrangement of the gelatin’s triple helix structure. The increase in the thermal stability of the composite membrane and the decrease in endothermic degree are due to the bonding among gelatin and chitosan and DAS in different ways, and crosslinking is an important way of bonding
