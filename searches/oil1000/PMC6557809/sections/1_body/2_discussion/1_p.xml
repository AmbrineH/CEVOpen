 </sup>. In terms of casted films, GC-C and GC-DC presented a smooth surface morphology and several small pores caused by solvent evaporation, indicating that the addition of chitosan could significantly improve the water resistance of the mixture membrane, and the membrane matrix polypeptide chain changed significantly. Such interference may cause a significant impediment to the gelatin moleculesâ€™ capacity to interact with water; it would be the primary responsibility of the composite film to reduce water solubility
