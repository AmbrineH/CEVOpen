<p id="Par19" class="p">The mechanical properties, barrier properties and thermal stability of the edible film depend to a large extent on the uniformity of macromolecules, the intermolecular forces and the solubility of the molecules, especially for the microstructure. The surface structure of the film can be observed more intuitively by scanning electron microscopy

 </sup>. It showed that the electrospun gelatin and chitosan had good compatibility and strong intermolecular force, forming a granular network structure. GC-C and GC-DC showed only a few small pores, revealing that the gelatin chain did not aggregate in the molecule because of the presence of chitosan, so the solvent may easily leave the polymer phase without generating pores

 </sup>. In contrast, in the electrospinning process, when the polymer is injected and accelerating toward the collector, becaues of the high surface area, rapid evaporation of the solvent occurs. It is believed that the solvent evaporation of electrospinning is based on droplets, whereas casting drying is surface based
