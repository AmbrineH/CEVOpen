<p id="Par25" class="p">An electrospinning device (Beijing Ucalery Technology Development Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) was used in the process. The solution was the same as the solution for the casting process. A syringe with solution was equipped with a 23-G steel needle and the solution was sprayed at a 0.1 mm/min velocity of flow. The positive and negative voltages were 22 and 2 kV, respectively; the distance from the sprinkler to the receiving device was 11 cm; and the receiving speed of the roller receiver and translation speed of the spraying device were 20 r/min and 200 mm/min respectively. The spin-coated film was collected on a flat piece of aluminum foil. The electrospinning condition was held at 30 °C, and the thickness of the film (GC-E and GC-DE, E in the abbreviation represents the electrospinning process.) was controlled in the range of 0.15 ± 0.05 mm.</p>
