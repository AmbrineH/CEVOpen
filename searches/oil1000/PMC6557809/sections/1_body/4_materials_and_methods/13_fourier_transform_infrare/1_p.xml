<p id="Par37" class="p">The composition of the secondary structure of edible films was analyzed by a Scimitar 2000 Near FTIR Spectrometer (Scimitar 2000, Madison, WI, USA). The wave number ranged from 4000 to 400 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and the resolution was 2 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with 32 scans. The sample (1 mg) and the dried KBr (100 mg) (Muyonga, Cole, &amp; Duodu, 2004b) were respectively placed in an agate mortar and ground to a uniform powder, loaded into a sample, and placed in a sample chamber for scanning. All FTIR experiments were performed in triplicate and used the software provided with the instrument to obtain the average spectrum.
