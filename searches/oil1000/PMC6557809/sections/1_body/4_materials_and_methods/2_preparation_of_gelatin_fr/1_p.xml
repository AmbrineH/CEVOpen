 </sup> with some modifications. The following operations were performed at room temperature unless otherwise specified. The treated bones were cut into small segments (~1 cm). Bone segments were soaked in 0.1 M NaOH solution (1:30 w/v) to remove noncollagenous proteins and the solution was changed every 2 h three times. Then, the bones were defatted with 10% isopropanol solution (1:30 w/v) for 12 h with slight stirring. The treated bones were soaked in 0.5 M EDTA-2Na solution (1:30 w/v)

 </sup> to decalcify them and the solution was changed every 6 h five times at 4 °C. The decalcified bones were soaked in 0.1 M glacial acetic acid solution (1:10 w/v) for 4 h with slight stirring to swell the collagen in the flounder bone and returned to neutral pH (6.5~7.0) (pH meter, Hangzhou Special Paper Co., Ltd, Zhejiang, China). The swollen flounder bones were soaked in distilled water at 55 °C for 8 h with successive stirring to extract gelatin. The mixture was centrifuged (Sorvall Stratos Centrifuge, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 8000 g for 20 min and the sediment was discarded. The gelatin supernatant was freeze-dried using a vacuum freeze dryer (FreeZone 2.5 L, Labconco, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
