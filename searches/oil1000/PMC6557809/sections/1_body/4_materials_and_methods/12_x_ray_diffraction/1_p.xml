<p id="Par36" class="p">The crystal structures of the edible films were investigated using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffraction instrument (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The scan speed was 10°/min using Cu Kɑ radiation with a test range from 5–50°(2θ). The X-ray generator had a tube current of 40 mA and an operating voltage of 40 kV. The experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>
