<p id="Par31" class="p">The mechanical strength of the films was tested using a TA-XT plus a texture analyzer with a 5-N-capacity load cell (Stable Micro Systems Ltd, Godalming, UK). The edible film was cut into rectangular strips of 50 × 20 mm and used for measuring the maximum tensile force and tensile strength at break. The samples were tested in 2 cycles at a test speed of 3.0 mm/s, pre-test speed of 1.0 mm/s, and post-test speed of 10.0 mm/s. The initial test pitch was 30 mm. Each sample was repeated 3 times, and the reading data were averaged prior to the statistical analysis.</p>
