<p id="Par26" class="p">Different from electrospinning, 2 syringes for coaxial electrospinning were used. Syringe A was loaded with core material, and syringe B was loaded with wall material. The core material was DAS and the speed of syringe A was 0.05 mm/min; the wall material was GCS and the speed of syringe B was 0.1 mm/min. Other conditions were the same as those of the electrospinning process. The films (GC-DTE; TE in the abbreviation represents the coaxial electrospinning process.) were kept in a vacuum dryer at a room temperature of 25 °C.</p>
