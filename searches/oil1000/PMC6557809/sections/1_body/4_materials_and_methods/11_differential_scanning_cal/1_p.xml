<p id="Par35" class="p">The denaturation temperatures of the edible film were measured with a differential scanning calorimeter (Q2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, USA). Seven mg of the sample was weighed into a DSC aluminum pan and sealed with a lid. The temperature was held at 20 °C for 1 min, with a heating rate of 5 °C/min heated from 20–90 °C and using an empty aluminum pan as a reference. The denaturation temperature was the temperature at the maximum point of the peak estimated using the TA Universal Analysis software (Q2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, USA), and the converted enthalpy was the area under the peak.</p>
