<p id="Par38" class="p">The microstructure of the edible film was observed by a scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). A suitable amount of the regular shape of the edible film sample was subjected to gold plating by ion sputtering (E-1045 ion sputter, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) to make the sample conductive and the surface structure was observed by magnifying by 1.0 k at a voltage of 3.0â€‰kV.</p>
