<p id="Par24" class="p">DAS was added to GCS at a concentration of 5% (v/v). Then, 30 mL solutions were poured on aluminum foil and desiccated at 30 °C in an oven (DHG-9055A blast drying oven, Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) for 24 h. The thickness of the film was controlled in the range of 0.15 ± 0.05 mm. The films (GC-C and GC-DC; D in the abbreviation represents docosahexaenoic acid and C represents the casting process) were held in a dryer (MZ250 Vacuum Desiccators, Shanghai Experi-mental Instrument Company, Shanghai, China) at a room temperature of 25 °C.</p>
