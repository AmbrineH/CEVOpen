 </sup> with a slight modification. Gelatin powder was mixed with 80% glacial acetic acid to obtain a concentration of 8% (w/v). The mixture was heated at 55 °C in a water bath (HH-6 Digital Display Thermostatic Bath, Changzhou Guohua Electric Appliance Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China) for 20 min with continuous stirring to completely solubilize the gelatin, and cooled to 45 °C. Glycerol (0.4 g/g gelatin) was added to the gelatin as a plasticizer. Simultaneously, chitosan solution was made to a 2% (w/v) concentration in 80% glacial acetic acid. The DHA powder was mixed with 80% glacial acetic acid to obtain a concentration of 10% (w/v) (DAS). The gelatin solution and chitosan solution were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) (GCS) and then successively stirred until the solution complete dissolution.
