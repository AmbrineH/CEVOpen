<p id="Par20" class="p">In this study, DHA powder-enhanced gelatin-chitosan edible film was prepared by casting, electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning, respectively. The electrospinning process and the coaxial electrospinning process produced a smooth surface visible to the naked eye with a uniform granular network structure in a unique film-forming manner, thereby exhibiting good water solubility and mechanical properties. In contrast, the casted film was smooth and transparent, and mechanically strong but poorly water soluble. Moreover, it was found that the addition of DHA powder affected the optical, physical, and mechanical properties of the film to varying degrees. These results indicated that these films can likely be used as activated materials for food packaging, and further research is required to define the application of these films in commercial food institutions, with potential applications value for controlled release in the biomedical field.</p>
