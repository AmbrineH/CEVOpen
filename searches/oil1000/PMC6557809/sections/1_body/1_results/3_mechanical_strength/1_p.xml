<p id="Par8" class="p">There were large differences in the mechanical strength of films formed in different ways, and blends of DAS with different methods could be useful to influence the tensile properties. The elongations at the break and tensile strengths of edible films are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The GC-C and GC-DC films produced a higher elongation at break of 146.6% and 135.7%, respectively, demonstrating good flexibility and deformability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3B</xref>). Moreover, the GC-E, GC-DE and GC-DTE films had lower elongation at break than those of the casted films at 52.4%, 48.9%, and 57.2%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3B</xref>). Thus, we concluded that the flexibility and strength of the edible films can be modified by different methods. However, we think that adding DAS to films produced different flexible films, which might endow them with wider applications.
