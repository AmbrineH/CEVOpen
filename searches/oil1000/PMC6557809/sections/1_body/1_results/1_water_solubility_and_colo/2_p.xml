 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> of GC-C were significantly higher than those of GC-DC, different from the films formed by electrospinning; GC-DE had the highest values, and those of GC-DTE were similar to those of GC-E and took second place. GC-C had the highest L* value, indicating better film transparency. Thus, it is believed that a DHA-enriched edible film source compound can cause increased brightness and improved visual quality.
