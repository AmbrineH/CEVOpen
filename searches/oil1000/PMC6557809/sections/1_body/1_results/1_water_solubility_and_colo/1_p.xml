 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> depicts different film formation methods using a source component with a water-soluble of DHA fortified sample and a control sample. As the figure shows the films formed by electrospinning had a significantly higher water solubility than the films formed by the casting process. The slight difference between GC-E and GC-DE was the presence of DAS, which was water soluble, so GC-DC had higher water solubility than GC-C. However, with DAS as the core material wrapped with GCS, GC-DTE had a slight higher water solubility than GC-DE.
