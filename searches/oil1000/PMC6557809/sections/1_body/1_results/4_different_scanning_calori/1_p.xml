 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. The enthalpy values of GC-C, GC-DC, GC-E, GC-DE and GC-DTE were 1.768, 4.331, 3.574, 3.939 and 2.021 J/g, and the melting temperatures of the GC-C, GC-DC, GC-E, GC-DE and GC-DTE were 56.18, 57.05, 57.58, 54.76 and 55.99 °C respectively. The crystalline structures of the edible films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5A</xref>). All edible films had similar observed diffraction patterns, with a narrow peak at 6.36° and a broad peak at 21.66°, and we used the Bragg equation d(Å) = λ/2sinθ (λ = 1.54 Å) to calculate the minimum values (d) of the repeat spacings, corresponding to the interplanar spacing of 13.88 Å and 4.10 Å

 </sup>. The XRD spectra of GC-C and GC-DC showed 2 wider peaks, the strength was significantly higher, and strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds led to intramolecular binding crystallinity.
