<p id="Par7" class="p">GC-C had similar light transmittance to that of with GC-DC, indicating that the addition of DAS had no major effect on the films made by casting, but it had a large influence on electrospinning, where the transmittance of GC-DE was higher than those of GC-DTE and GC-E. The addition of DAS in electrospinning could significantly increase the light transmittance, which may cause varying degrees of light scattering as a result of the DAS distributed throughout the film. In the visible region of 350–800 nm, the transparency of the edible films gradually stabilized with increased wavelengths of ultraviolet light. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, the transmittance of visible light was greater than 95% and nearly 100% for casted films at 400–800 nm, whereas the transmittance was at 60–85% for electrospun films.
