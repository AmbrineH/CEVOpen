<p id="Par11" class="p">Visually, the casted films were solid and semitransparent, whereas the electrospun films appeared to be white. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows that the surface of GC-C and GC-DC was smooth, the interface morphology was slightly rough, fine cracks were present, and no obvious wrinkles and bubbles were present, indicating that the molecules were uniformly dispersed and the film-forming effect was good. The surface of GC-E, GC-DE, and GC-DTE was uneven, composed of fiber beads, with obvious uniform pores and bulges, but the blending of materials formed a uniform dispersion system, the mesh surface was relatively tight, and the texture was relatively regular.
