<p id="Par10" class="p">The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the 5 different edible films are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5B</xref>, and the FTIR data are shown in detail in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The 5 different edible films displayed similar main peaks, but the amplitude varied dramatically, with some of them moving. FTIR spectra are very effective in studying hydrogen bonding and compatibility, allowing observation of the FTIR spectra attributable to hydrogen bonding and the strength of hydrogen bonding. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5B</xref> shows that the peak intensities of the electrospun films were better than those of the casted films, and the coaxial electrospun films were the best. The peak intensity of the films with DAS was better than that of the films without DAS. Therefore, we confirmed that the addition of DAS to and use of coaxial electrospinning with gelatin-chitosan film can facilitate uniform mixing in the film.
