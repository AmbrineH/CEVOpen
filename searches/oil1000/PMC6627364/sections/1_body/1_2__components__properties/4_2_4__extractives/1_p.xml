 <xref rid="B249-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">249</xref>]. Organic solvents, such as ethanol, methanol, acetone or their mixtures such as chloroform:methanol, have been used for the extraction of antioxidant components, some illustrative examples are shown in 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00314-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>. The choice of extracting solvents with different polarities can have a significant effect due to the different nature of compounds present in the seaweeds and also speciesâ€“species differences. Intensification with ultrasound was suggested to enhance the solvent extraction process [
