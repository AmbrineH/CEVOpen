<p class="p">Mycosporine-like amino acids are low-molecular-weight, water-soluble components with antioxidant and photoprotective properties found in red seaweeds. Since they have been reported as the strongest UVA-absorbing compounds in nature, they have been proposed as photoprotective materials for skin care products. The antioxidant and antiproliferative activities and mycosporine-like amino acid depended on locations varying in UV-exposure [
