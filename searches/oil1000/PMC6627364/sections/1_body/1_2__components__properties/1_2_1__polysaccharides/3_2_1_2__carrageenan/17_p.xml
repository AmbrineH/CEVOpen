<p class="p">Acid hydrolysis has been considered as a common and rapid method. The presence of acid and oxidizing agents may induce carrageenan depolymerization through cleavage of glycosidic linkages, a process accelerated by dissolved oxygen, high temperature and low pH. In order to limit undesirable degradation, high temperature and short time mild acid hydrolysis is preferred [

 <xref rid="B179-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>] reported that carrageenans were stable to desulfation during acid (pH 2) hydrolysis at 35 and 55 °C. Kalitnik et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Chondrus armatus</italic> κ-carrageenan under conditions avoiding excess destruction of 3,6-AGal and observed that mild and acid hydrolysis cause breakage of inside α-1,3 links, producing mainly odd-numbered oligosaccharides. Mild acid hydrolysis at 37 ºC increased yields of even fractions in comparison with those obtained at 60 °C [
