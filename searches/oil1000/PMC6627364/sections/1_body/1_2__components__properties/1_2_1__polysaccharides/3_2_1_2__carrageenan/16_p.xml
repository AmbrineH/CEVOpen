The biological profile of the products may be influenced by the depolymerization method, since it affects their size and molecular weight. In addition, carrageenan or their derived oligosaccharides may also be chemically modified by oversulfation, desulfation, acetylation or phosphorylation to achieve better physicochemical and biological properties [
