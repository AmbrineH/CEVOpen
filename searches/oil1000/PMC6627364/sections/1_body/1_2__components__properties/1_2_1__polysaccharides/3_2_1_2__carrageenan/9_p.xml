<p class="p">Specific details of the commercial extraction processes are trade secrets for the manufacturers of carrageenan. The seaweed is usually dried quickly to prevent degradation during transportation to the processing facilities. The original method to produce the commercial carrageenans is based on washing to remove impurities, such as sand, epiphytes and salt and the carrageenan extraction in a hot aqueous solution, neutral or alkaline, filtration, recovery from the solution by alcohol precipitation, separation of the precipitate, drying and milling. However, this method is time and energy consuming, and has a low extraction efficiency. Alternatively, extraction of minerals, protein and lipids can be proposed, leaving in the raffinate the carrageenan and cellulose as a semi-refined low purity carrageenan. The main variables during extraction, namely temperature, pH, time and alkaline pre-treatment (alkaline agent, concentration and time), have to be optimized for each seaweed to maximize the structural and gelling properties [
