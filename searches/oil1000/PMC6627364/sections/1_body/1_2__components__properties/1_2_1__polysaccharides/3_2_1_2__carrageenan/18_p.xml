<p class="p">Enzymatic hydrolysis offers advantages due to its high efficiency under mild conditions, avoids the use of polluting chemicals, and the resulting oligosaccharides generated show higher homogeneity and lower polydispersity, thus providing compounds with improved and reproducible biological properties [
 <xref rid="B107-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. In addition, it avoids side reactions leading to undesired modifications of the native structure and the release of high amounts of monosaccharides and undesirable toxic products [
 <xref rid="B8-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The enzymatic method, either using non-specific commercial enzymes or carragenases, is a relatively costly alternative. Carrageenases, produced only by marine gram negative bacterial species, are endohydrolases that hydrolyze the internal Î²-1,4 linkages in carrageenans [
