<p class="p">Carrageenan can be degraded by gamma irradiation, operating in different systems (solid, gel or solution) at ambient temperature and the molecular weights can be lowered to 8–100 kDa with a narrow distribution, but different yield and susceptibility to degradation occur for the different carrageenan types.
