<p class="p">Carrageenans are high-molecular-weight linear hydrophilic, sulfated galactans formed by alternate units of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose alternately linked by α-1,3 and β-1,4 glycosidic linkages. They can be classified according to differences in their average molecular mass and to the number and the position of the sulfate ester groups and the occurrence of a 3,6 anhydro-ring in the α-linked galactose. The three types with higher commercial importance, namely κ-, ι- and λ-carrageenan, are presented in
