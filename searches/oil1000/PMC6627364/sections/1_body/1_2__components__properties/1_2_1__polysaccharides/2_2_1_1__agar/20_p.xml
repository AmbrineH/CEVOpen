<p class="p">Zou et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] prepared low molecular weight polysaccharides (3.2, 10.5, 29.0, and 48.8 kDa) from 
 <italic class="italic">Pyropia yezoensis</italic> using microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis. The lower molecular weight (Mw) product (3.2 kDa) was the most efficient protecting wheat seedlings against salt stress. These authors also indicated that microwave irradiation accelerated the reaction rate. Stronger gels were also obtained using microwave assisted extraction when compared with gels produced applying the traditional method. The average sulfate content was similar to the obtained by the traditional method from 
 <italic class="italic">G. vermiculophylla</italic> produced in the selected integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) system. However, radical depolymerization assisted by ultrasounds induced a loss of sulfate functions in addition to the shortening of the polysaccharides chain length [
 <xref rid="B97-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. It should be indicated that the microwave assisted extraction approach requires less energy and solvent than conventional processes, while generating fewer wastes.
