<p class="p">Although 
 <italic class="italic">Gelidium</italic> agar has better quality and is easily extracted with boiling water, the gelling ability of agars from 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria sp</italic> can be enhanced by an alkali pretreatment to convert α-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-galactose 6 sulfate into 3,6-anhydro-α-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-galactose. This treatment reduces the sulfate content and improves the gelling properties as evidenced by higher gel strength, gelling, melting temperatures and viscosity [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Generally, the alkali-treatment was most effective for obtaining more galactose-rich hydrocolloids [
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. However, agar degradation and diffusion towards the aqueous medium could occur, reducing the extraction yield [

 <xref rid="B55-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], although in some cases, no reduction was observed [
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Alkaline pretreatment variables, such as alkaly type and concentration or heating time and temperature affected the yield and quality of the agar. Regardless the alkaline concentration, NaOH rendered agar with a higher quality than KOH [

 <xref rid="B56-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Compilations of conditions are also found in [
 <xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], being the optimal in the range 5–7% NaOH, up to 80–100 °C for 0.5–3 h [

 <xref rid="B50-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], but higher alkali concentrations (10%) [
 <xref rid="B55-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], shorter times [
 <xref rid="B57-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] and the application of several stages [
 <xref rid="B53-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] have also been reported. An alternative pretreatment was proposed by Roleda [
 <xref rid="B58-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], which consisted of soaking the 
 <italic class="italic">Gelidiella acerosa</italic> air dried sample in 0.5% acetic acid for 1 h at 16–20 °C, then 1 h steam pressure at 15–20 psi and boiling at 100 °C. Freile-Pelegrín [
 <xref rid="B59-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] proposed the cultivation of 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria cornes</italic> under dark and salinity treatments (50 and 25% salinity) to replace the alkali treatment. Pigments, such as chlorophyll, carotenoids and phycoerythrobilin, can be leached out during the alkaline pretreatment and an alternative environmentally friendly scalable photobleaching process for 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria asiatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria lemaneiformis</italic> with 3–5% NaOH and photobleaching for 5 h was proposed [
 <xref rid="B60-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The pigments and the agar sulfate contents decreased during the photobleaching agar extraction process, and the gel strength increased during the photolysis.
