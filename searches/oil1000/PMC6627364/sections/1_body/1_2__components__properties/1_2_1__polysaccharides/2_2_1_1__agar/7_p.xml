Some species from temperate and cold water could be more resistant to hydrolysis during storage. Postharvest treatment with acid, alkali or formaldehyde is necessary to prevent enzymatic and microbial degradation [

Another factor requiring attention after harvesting algae is correct drying under 20% moisture and packing, and avoid wetting during the transporting and storage period, but dewatering pre-treatments have to be defined according to the species and to collection season [
