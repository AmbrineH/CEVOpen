<p class="p">Agaro-oligosaccharide dried products show high thermal and pH stability; however, the drying step is highly relevant to other product properties, both functional (water solubility index, water absorption capacity and oil absorption capacity) and antioxidant (radical scavenger and reducing capacity). Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] observed the highest solubility index in spray dried products and the highest water and oil absorption capacities in freeze dried products, which showed minimal color deterioration and higher oxidative stability, whereas the oven drying could be more deleterious. Antiradical properties were high in freeze-dried and spray-dried oligosaccharide powders.
