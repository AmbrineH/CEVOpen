<p class="p">Microwave assisted extraction (MAE) allowed reducing the required 2â€“4 h for agar extraction in conventional processes to a very short period, consuming less energy and solvent volume and reducing waste disposal requirements [

 <xref rid="B68-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] used microwave assisted alkaline modification to improve the gelling properties of carrageenans from

 <italic class="italic">Porphyra columbina</italic>. Substantial depolymerization of 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria vermiculophylla</italic> agar was observed in microwave assisted extraction with lower values of viscosity and molecular weight (54 kDa against 111 kDa) and methylation degree than those obtained in conventional extraction [
