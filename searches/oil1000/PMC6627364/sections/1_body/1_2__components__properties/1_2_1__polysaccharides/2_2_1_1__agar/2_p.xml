 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00314-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Agarose is a neutral linear polysaccharide composed of three linked β-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galactose and four linked 3,6-anhydro-α-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-galactose. Agaropectin is an acid polysaccharide containing sulfate groups, pyruvic acid, and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-glucuronic acid conjugated to agarobiose. Agarose accounts for up to 70% of the mixture and is responsible for gelling, whereas agaropectin is responsible for thickening characteristics. Different derived agarose molecules can be obtained from chemical or enzymatic degradation. Most of the corresponding hydrolysis products such as agarooligosaccharides (AOSs), neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOSs), neoagarobiose (NAB) and 3,6-anhydro-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-galactose (
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-AHG) exhibit biological activities [
