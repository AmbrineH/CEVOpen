<p class="p">Combination of techniques was also useful, enzyme and ultrasound assisted extraction led to the same sulfated polysaccharides from

 <xref rid="B75-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], but the yield was higher when both techniques were jointly applied to alkaline treated seaweeds. Combined techniques were used in the extraction of pigments and sulfated polysaccharides from the red alga 
 <italic class="italic">G. verrucosa</italic>. The method is easy to use, allows the extraction of pigments and agar highly quantitative in one step. Sulfated polysaccharides obtained were similar to agar extracted directly from dried material without any treatment. Compared to the common agar extraction method, enzyme mixtures tested for R-phycoerythrin can be proposed as pretreatment for agar extraction. However, Öğretmen and Duyar [
 <xref rid="B98-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] observed that autoclave provided lower agar yields than water bath from Gelidium latifolium.
