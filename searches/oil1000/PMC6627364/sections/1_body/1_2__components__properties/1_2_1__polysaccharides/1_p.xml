 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The composition, structure and rheological properties are influenced by the algal source, life-stage, growth, environment and by the extraction method [
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Agars and carrageenans are major cell wall polysaccharides in red macroalgae, also known as galactans, accounting for up to 40â€“50% of the dry weight. They are highly anionic homopolysaccharides, composed of a backbone built from disaccharide blocks of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose (
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-AHG in agar and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-AHG in carrageenan) with different sulfation, methylation and pyruvation patterns that vary among species [

 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The high electronegative charge density from their sulfated esters favors the electrostatic interactions with specific proteins, determining their biological effects, which are also closely related to the structural features [
