 <italic class="italic">Kappaphycus alvarezii</italic> processed by pressurized hot water extraction. Whereas the hydrolysis efficiency increased from 150 °C to 270 °C, and decreased at 300 °C due to decomposition and protein denaturation, the highest foaming properties were attained at 150 °C, whereas the best emulsifying properties were found at 300 °C. Pangestuti et al. [
 <xref rid="B231-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">231</xref>] proposed the hydrolysis of 
 <italic class="italic">Hypnea musciformis</italic> using subcritical water extraction (120–270 °C) to obtain antioxidant and functional material. They found increased protein and sugar content at 120–150 °C, more marked at higher temperatures (180–210 °C), showing the highest antioxidant activity and thermostable emulsifying properties, which could be related to the increased solubility of protein, to the hydrolysis of oligosaccharides and the degradation of monosaccharides.
