<p class="p">Additionally, it can be useful in combination with other intensification technologies. Le Guillard et al. [
 <xref rid="B233-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">233</xref>] reported ultrasound-assisted extraction and ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis with an enzymatic cocktail for the extraction of R-phycoerythrin from 
 <italic class="italic">Grateloupia turuturu</italic>. They recommended the use of 22 °C to avoid R-PE destruction, and 40 °C when the objective was liquefaction. Enzymatic hydrolysis was combined with mechanical methods, namely, ultrasonication [

 <xref rid="B220-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>] reported on the use of a non-thermal high hydrostatic pressure (400 MPa, 20 min) processing combined with polysaccharidases to improve the extraction of proteins, polyphenols and polysaccharides from

 <italic class="italic">Gelidium pusillum</italic> and observed a synergistic effect of ultrasonication when employed in combination with other conventional extraction methods, although ultrasonication alone was not efficient. However, Harrysson et al. [
