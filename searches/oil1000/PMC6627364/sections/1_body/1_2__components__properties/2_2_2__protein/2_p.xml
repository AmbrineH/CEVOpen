<p class="p">Red algae have a characteristic bright pink color caused by phycobiliproteins. Phycobiliproteins are covalently bound via cysteine amino acids to pigmented phycobilins [

 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. They are classified into phycoerythrin (red) and phycocyanin (blue). The two types of phycoerythrin (PE) were named after the taxa of the organism form which they were first isolated: R-PE from Rhodophyta and B-PE from Bangiales. Phycocyanins are further subdivided into C-phycocyanin, R-phycocyanin, allophycocyanin or phycoerythrocyanin. Examples of phycobiliproteins found in red seaweeds are shown in
