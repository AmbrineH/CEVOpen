Macroalgae also contain various other lipids and lipid like compounds such as sterols, phospholipids and glycolipids, but red seaweeds have a high ω-3 fatty acids content, being a rich source of α-linolenic acid (ALA) [18:3(ω3)], AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) [20:5(n-3)], and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [22:6(ω3)]), and most species showed a nutritionally beneficial ω6/ω3 ratio [

Some macroalgae present a low ω6/ω3 ratio, the ω3 polysunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) cannot be synthesized by humans and are thus obtained only through dietary sources. Their therapeutic, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), has been shown in the reduction of blood cholesterol, and in the protection against cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases [
