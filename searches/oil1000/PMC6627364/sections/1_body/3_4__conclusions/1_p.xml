<p class="p">The integral utilization of the valuable components from red seaweeds is a technologically feasible approach with environmental and economic advantages. Apart from gelling biopolymers, a number of bioactive compounds with nutritional, functional or biological features can be recovered from red macroalgae using conventional and greener technologies. The challenge is the sequential extraction of these components using emerging technologies for the integral valorization of this type of macroalgae. This opens new attractive alternatives to fulfill the growing marketâ€™s demand for natural bioactive compounds of interest in the food, cosmetic, personal care, biomedical or pharmaceutical field.</p>
