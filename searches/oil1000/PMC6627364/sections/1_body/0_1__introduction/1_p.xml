<p class="p">Seaweeds are widespread and traditionally used in Eastern countries for food and for medicinal purposes. In Western countries, despite being included recently in the diet, direct human consumption is still unusual, mainly being used for the production of hydrocolloids with thickening and gelling properties. Among seaweeds, red algae (Rhodophyta) contain high amounts of polysaccharides (floridean starch and sulfated galactans, such as carrageenans or agarans), proteins and derived peptides (phycobiliproteins, phycolectins and mycosporine-like amino acids), minerals and other valuable compounds, such as polyphenols and lipids [
