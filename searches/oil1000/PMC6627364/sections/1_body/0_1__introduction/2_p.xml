<p class="p">The reader can find compilations on the chemical and nutritional characteristics of seaweeds as a feed livestock resource [
 <xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and its health-promoting properties [
 <xref rid="B4-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], including the anticancer [
 <xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and antiviral [
 <xref rid="B6-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] features. Additionally, there have been some interesting reviews on the use of red seaweeds for carrageenans [
 <xref rid="B7-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], agar and carrageenan oligosaccharides [
 <xref rid="B8-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The extraction technology, which influences the composition, structure and properties of the target solutes, is conventionally addressed using chemicals, in long term operation, and with high energy consumption [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The recent developments of blue biotechnology and novel extraction techniques meeting the requirements of low cost, sustainability, food-compatibility and industrial scale feasibility to obtain seaweed components [
 <xref rid="B10-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], the systematical selection of operational variables of emerging extraction technologies [
 <xref rid="B11-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] or the use of alternative solvents, such as ionic liquids [
 <xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], or supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for macro and microalgae [
 <xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] have been reviewed. Scarcer studies are focused on the extraction of red seaweed components, such as carrageenan and agar fractions [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], photoprotective substances [
 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and pigments [
 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Particular interest has been on the influence on the depolymerization of saccharidic and protein components, since both the type of extraction process and the operational conditions have to be controlled depending on the future uses [
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]; however, further development and additional studies are still needed [
 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The mentioned studies are oriented to the selective extraction of some valuable fractions, but scarce information is found for the simultaneous utilization of the different components in a more rational scheme, following the philosophy of the biorefineries [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Biomass refineries, with a production scheme analogous to the petroleum refineries, are aimed at obtaining a wide range of products from renewable raw materials, including value added components for the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, as well as biofuels. These multistage multiproduct processes are based on the sequential fractionation of the biomass and on their subsequent physical, chemical or biotechnological transformation into the target final products. This sustainable approach adopts an integral utilization of resources, promoting the development of a marine bio-economy.
