<p class="p">The present review presents an overview of the properties and potential applications of red seaweed bioactives, the specific technologies for extraction and also for the depolymerization of agar and carrageenan into oligosaccharides, as well as the potential of these techniques for the extraction of other red seaweed components. Both conventional and emerging extraction and depolymerization technologies are discussed with the aim of promoting the sustainability based on (i) the development of clean processes and (ii) the integral utilization and valorization of resources following the philosophy of biomass biorefineries.</p>
