 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00314-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> represents a general flow diagram for a multistage multipurpose biorefinery processing of red seaweeds. The suggested scheme is based on the initial production of food or feed products, with the final ones being destined to energetic and soil applications. It is desirable that biorefineries are designed in a flexible way allowing the possibility of processing different seaweeds, obtaining different products including those of high volume/low quality and those of high quality/low volume ones. If possible, it is also recommended to integrate food and non-food sectors. In the extraction stages, the utilization of more efficient greener technologies is recommended to enhance the yields and productivities, keeping the products quality and lowering energetic and operation costs.
