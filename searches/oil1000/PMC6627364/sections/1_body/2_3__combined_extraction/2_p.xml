 <xref rid="B254-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">254</xref>] proposed an initial extraction of the pigments for decolorization of

 <xref rid="B261-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">261</xref>] observed that after water extraction of proteins from 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria lemaneiformis</italic> and further purification of R-phycoerythrin the remaining biomass was used for agar extraction. The yield of agar and its properties showed no significant difference from those obtained from the direct agar extraction from the dried algae. However, the R-phycoerythin recovery and purity were lower than when it was extracted from fresh algae. The most frequent approach consists on the valorization of the waste fractions after phycocolloid extraction as a source of protein. Cian et al. [

 <xref rid="B263-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">263</xref>] reported the use of 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyra columbina</italic> wastes to obtain proteins that after proteolystic digestion to produce fractions with immunosuppressive, antihypertensive and antioxidant actions.
