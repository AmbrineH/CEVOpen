<p class="p">Most of the proposed extraction processes are not selective and apart from the target compound, others can also be obtained. This could be illustrated with some examples. Extraction by enzymatic hydrolysis of R-phycoerythrin from

During protein extraction, the mineral content in the extracts could be enhanced using accelerated solvent extraction produced extracts compared to that of conventional extracts, whereas the pH-shift-produced extracts had lower ash content than the whole biomass. Although the co-extraction of other compounds different from the target ones could difficult and make more expensive the purification stages, the presence of other high-value food components could confer additional value and synergistic functional and biological properties to the final product. This could occur, as fatty acids together with proteins could be of interest for producing multi-functional protein extracts [
