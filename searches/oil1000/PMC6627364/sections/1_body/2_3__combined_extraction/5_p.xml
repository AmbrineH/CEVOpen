However, in the present review, the valorization of bioactives is emphasized, and this type of seaweed is highly interesting, since they contain a high proportion of proteins, some being colorants (R-phycoerythrin, R-phycocyanin), fatty acids and minerals. Therefore, biotechnological, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications have been highlighted.
