<p class="p">Even when the ethanol production was also considered in their approach, Baghel et al. [
 <xref rid="B264-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">264</xref>], have designed a complete valorization of 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria corticata</italic> bioactives, including phycobiliproteins, lipids and agar. The solid residue after phycocolloid extraction is still a good source of bioactives and has been explored in a number of studies. Based on the ingent amounts generated during industrial processing, their valorization would also report environmental benefits. Cian et al. [
 <xref rid="B263-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">263</xref>] used this waste from 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyra columbina</italic> to obtain low molecular weight peptides with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitory action, as well as antioxidant properties, which could also be due to some phenolic compounds. Laohakunjit [
 <xref rid="B214-marinedrugs-17-00314" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>] proposed the hydrolysis of 
 <italic class="italic">Gracilaria fisheri</italic> residue after agar extraction and the protein hydrolysate was used to obtain free amino acids and odorant compounds valuable as an umami conferring tasting product.
