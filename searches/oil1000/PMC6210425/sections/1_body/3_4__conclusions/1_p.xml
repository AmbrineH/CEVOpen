<p class="p">The ethanol extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic> L. shows bacteriostatic properties and antiadhesive activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. strains isolated from commercial soft drinks. Our study results suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic> L. extract can be considered as a good source of natural compounds with significant antioxidant activity. The antiadhesive action of mint makes it an interesting component of soft drinks to counteract the formation of bacterial cell aggregates, flocks, haziness, biofilms and, finally, it will allow to find several applications for shelf-life extending of soft drinks.
