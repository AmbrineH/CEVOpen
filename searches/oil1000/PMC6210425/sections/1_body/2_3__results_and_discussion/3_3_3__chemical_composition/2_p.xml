<p class="p">The phenolic acid content, as well as the essential oils, in the mint extracts has an influence on the biological activities of this plant material. It has been documented that gallic and caffeic acids show activity against the Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, as well as 
 <italic class="italic">Staph. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. It is well known that, along with phenolic acids, mint is a rich source of essential oils (EOs). It is believed that antimicrobial activity of the extract is the result of the synergistic actions of various bioactive compounds contained in the tested extract [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Dhifi et al., (2013) reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> essential oil showed high activity against Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Staph. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staph. aureus</italic>, as well as Gram-negative cells of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Soković et al., (2010) found that 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oils were more active than oils from sweet basil, lavender, sage or camomile against a wide spectrum of bacterial strains: 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> O157:H7, 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Proteus mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Staph. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. They also noted that menthol was more active than other compounds extracted from tested plants: linalyl acetate, limonene, β-pinene, α-pinene, camphor, linalool and 1,8-cineole. In general, the better activity of both the extracts and essential oils of mint have been noted for Gram-positive bacteria. Presumably, the lower susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria results inter alia from the presence of hydrophobic lipopolysaccharides in their outer membrane, which provides protection against different antimicrobial agents [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This structure prevents the depolarization, pores formation and increasing of membrane permeability [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The crucial factors affecting the antimicrobial activity include: the composition of used extract, the concentration of active substances as well as the type of tested microorganism. The composition of active substances may be determined by plant cultivation method, environmental conditions, time of plant harvesting, method of plant drying, and storage conditions, as well as extraction method [
