<p class="p">Plants of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> show a great chemical variability. Reports on chemical composition of mint species showed that many factors interfere with bioactive compound composition, among them environmental (growth location, soil characteristics, moisture presence, temperature, etc.), phenological (phase of the plant collection), plant part used for extraction (flowers, stems, leaves, entire aerial parts or inflorescences), type of material (fresh or dry), and even methods used for chemical analysis. According to the literature, rosmarinic acid, luteolin-7-

 <xref rid="foods-07-00171-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the mint extract used in the study was a source mainly of phenolic acids, such as gallic, chlorogenic, neochlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic as well as rosmarinic acids. In addition, the presence of epicatechin, quercetin-3-rutinoside and quercetin was also found.
