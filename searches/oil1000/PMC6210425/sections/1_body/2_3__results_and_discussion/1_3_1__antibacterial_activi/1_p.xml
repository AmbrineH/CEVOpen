<p class="p">The biological activities of mint extract were evaluated against six strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. under in vitro conditions. The tested ethanol extract showed weak bacteriostatic properties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00171-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The maximum value of absorbance after 40 h of cultivation in the control medium (minimal medium) was approximately 0.28. The best growth was obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> ISD2, while among 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis,</italic> strain IFCW showed the best proliferation. However, in the medium containing 10% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> L., bacterial growth was slightly inhibited, and the maximum value of absorbance was approximately 0.21. Antibacterial activity of mint extracts against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is well documented. Sujana et al., (2013) found that 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> L. leaf extract showed stronger activity against Gram-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus)</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis)</italic> than against Gram-negative 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Antibacterial effect of peppermint water extract was also noted against 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps. aeruginosa)</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Serratia marcescens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The studies conducted by Laggoune et al., (2016) indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteus mirabilis</italic> strains were sensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata (M. spicata)</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. What is more, in the study of Dhiman et al. (2016), the authors tested the effect of acetone, methanol, ethanol, and water extracts of mint against spoiled juice-isolated microorganisms: 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Serratia</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Despite the fact that in the in vivo studies, the extract of mint showed a bacteriostatic effect, it should be remembered that this activity can be clearly different in a food industry environment. In general, biological activity can be influenced by food components (e.g., fats, carbohydrates, proteins, water, salt, preservatives), temperature, pH, water activity and packaging methods. Thus, to confirm the effectiveness of improving the stability and shelf-life of products through the growth inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp., it is necessary to conduct tests using the appropriate matrix.
