<p class="p">Analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. adhesion to polystyrene surfaces was carried out in minimal medium with 10% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) mint extract. The results of the plate count method and luminometry, expressed respectively as adhesion coefficient A (%) and adhesion (RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00171-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Both methods showed that 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. strains are characterized by strong adhesion properties. The relative coefficient A (%) for minimal medium ranged from 0.47% for 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> IFCW to 1.11% for 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> ISD2. The results of luminometry showed that adhesion ranged from 4430 RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> IFCW to 8450 RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for 
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> W4. The results agree with those obtained by Kregiel and co-workers [

 <xref rid="B12-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Our research confirmed that adhesion is a strain-dependent feature. According to the literature, adhesion of bacterial cells to different surfaces is usually correlated with the cell starvation. Biofilm formation occurs in rather poor environments, and in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp., in the presence of sucrose as a carbon source. The knowledge of factors involved in biofilm formation by 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. is limited, but it has been shown that extracellular polymeric substances promote biofouling [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The physicochemical properties of abiotic materials play an important role in this phenomenon. It is known that adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces happens more intensively in comparison to hydrophilic surfaces with lower contact angles. Plastic materials, such as polystyrene, with a higher contact angle (87째) and low free energy (40 mN/m at 20 째C), are more hydrophobic than glass (contact angle 44째 and surface free energy equal 70 mN/m at 20째). Thus, we may conclude that plastic packaging materials commonly used in beverage industry support bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation [
