<p class="p">According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00171-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, there are two potential mechanisms of inhibition of biofilm formation by mint extract. First of all, it may show antibacterial activity, which is evidenced by spectrophotometric results and fluorescence microscopic images.

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) ME. In both cases, a significant proportion of dead (red) cells to live (green) was visible. What is more, in comparison to biofilms in the control sample (without mint extract), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00171-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A,C show a lower level of living cells. The bacterial viability kit used in our study was a mixture of SYTO

 <sup class="sup">®</sup>9 used alone labels both bacteria with damaged membranes and those with intact membranes. In turn, propidium iodide exhibits activity only in relation to bacteria with damaged membranes, and at the same time, it causes SYTO

By comparing the surfaces of biofilms, meaningfully smaller areas of biofilms were formed in the medium with the addition of the mint extract than in the case of in the control media.
