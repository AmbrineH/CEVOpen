<p class="p">The application of mint extract caused the reduction in cells adhesion of almost all 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. strains. The values of the relative adhesion coefficient A (%) show that 10% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) mint extract inhibited adhesion of all strains of 
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00171-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A). However, the reduction of coefficient A (%) for 
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> FFMW and 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> W4 was not statistically significant compared to the control medium (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≥ 0.05). The highest decrease of A (%) values (73%), between adhesion in the medium with mint extract and adhesion in control medium, was noted for 
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> ISD1. A slight decrease in the relative adhesion coefficient A (%) was noted for 
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> FFMW and 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> W4. On the other hand, the results obtained by the luminometric method were more divergent. According to the values of relative light units per square centimeter of the carrier [RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>], the antiadhesive effect of mint extract was significant for most of tested strains. Only for two strains—
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> FFMW and 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> W4—was a slight increase in adhesion noted. However, these results were not statistically significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≥ 0.05). The strongest antiadhesive activity was noted for 
 <italic class="italic">As. bogorensis</italic> ISD1 and 
 <italic class="italic">As. lannensis</italic> FMW1. For ISD1, the luminometric values were reduced from the 7320 RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to 4100 RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (decrease by 44%). Meanwhile, for FMW1, a reduction from 4450 RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to 2450 RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> was noted.
