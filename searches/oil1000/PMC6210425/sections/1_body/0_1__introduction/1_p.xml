<p class="p">Soft drinks constitute a diverse group of products. Their classification depends on the basis of sugar or sweetener content, fruit juice and flavor addition, carbonation level, as well as their functionality. Functional beverages, except water, sweeteners, foaming agents, preservatives, aromas and colorants, contain bioactive substances such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids and proteins, dietary fiber, caffeine or taurine [

On the other hand, the addition of specific functional additives may lead to the microbial instability of final products, providing additional nutrients for spoilage microorganisms. In addition, the low pH level of functional drinks reaching value below 4, along with the addition of conventional preservatives (sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, dimethyl dicarbonate) are not usually sufficient to ensure microbial stability of final products. Soft drinks can be a favorable environment for the growth of yeasts, molds and acidophilic bacteria. Acetic acid bacteria belonging to the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Acetobacter</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Gluconobacter</italic> are often isolated from non-alcoholic drinks [

 <xref rid="B3-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, in recent years, functional drinks have often been contaminated by other acetic acid bacteria belonging to the genus

 <xref rid="B7-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Our long cooperation with Polish drinks factories shows that 
 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. growth occurs despite the low pH of the beverages and the addition of chemical preservatives [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. As a result, manufacturers take steps aimed at preventing the appearance of defective products on the market. Therefore, our study is the consequence of cooperation with the companies interested in unknown spoilage microorganisms, which are difficult to detect and identify.
