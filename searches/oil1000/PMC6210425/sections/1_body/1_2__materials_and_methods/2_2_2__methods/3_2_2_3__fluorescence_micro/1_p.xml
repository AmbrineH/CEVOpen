<p class="p">Visualization of bacterial cells in biofilms was performed by staining using a LIVE/DEAD
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> BacLight
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> Bacterial Viability Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s procedure. Biofilms were gently washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, and then the entire surface was covered with a staining solution. The samples were incubated in darkness for 20 min at 25 °C. Images were taken using fluorescence microscope OLYMPUS BX53 equipped with filters with excitation wavelength ranging from 470 nm to 630 nm, and a high-resolution digital color camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) [
