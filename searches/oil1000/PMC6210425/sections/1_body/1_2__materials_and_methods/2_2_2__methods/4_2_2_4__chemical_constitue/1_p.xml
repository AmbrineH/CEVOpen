<p class="p">The phenolic compounds contained in the tested extract were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a diode array detector (DAD) (Finnigan Surveyor-PDA Plus detector, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and ChromQuest 5.0 chromatography software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Separation was achieved on a Lichrospher RP 18–5 (250 mm by 4.6 mm, 5 µm packing; Hichrom, Reading, UK). The elution conditions were as follows: flow rate of 0.8 mL/min; oven temperature of 25 °C; solvent A (5% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) formic acid), and solvent B (95% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) acetonitrile). The injection volume was 50 µL. Detection was conducted at 280, 320, and 360 nm. The identification of compounds was carried out on the basis of the results for the standards. Gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), epicatechin (Sigma-Aldrich), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid (Sigma-Aldrich), ferulic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), rosmarinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), quercetin-3-rutinoside (Sigma-Aldrich), caffeic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as pure standard solutions. On the basis of results obtained for tested plant sample and pure standards, the individual components of mint extract were identified.
