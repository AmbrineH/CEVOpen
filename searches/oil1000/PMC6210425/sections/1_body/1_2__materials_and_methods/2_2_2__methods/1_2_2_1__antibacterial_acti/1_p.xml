 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> L. ethanol extract was added to 150 µL of minimal medium and mixed. Next, each microplate cell was inoculated with 50 µL of the standardized bacterial suspension. The final concentration of mint extract was 10% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and concentration of bacterial cells was approximately 10

 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells per mL. The control sample was inoculated minimal medium without extract. Multiplates were incubated using a MULTISKAN GO spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 25 °C for 40 h. Measurements of absorbance were carried out automatically every 1 h at a wavelength of 540 nm. The results are shown as the difference in absorbance (ΔAbs) after the measurement carried out for each hour (Abs
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>) and absorbance of medium at the beginning of the experiment (Abs
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>).
