Sterile rectangular carriers were placed vertically into the liquid culture medium in such a way that half of the carrier was immersed in the medium. The culture media were inoculated by standardized bacterial suspension, and final concentration of bacterial cells was approximately 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells per mL at the beginning of the experiment. The cultures were incubated at 25 °C for 6 days on a laboratory rotary shaker at 130 rpm.
