<p class="p">The adhesion analysis was performed by the plate count method and luminometric measurements described by Kregiel (2013) [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-07-00171" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. To determine the number of the bacterial cells attached to tested surfaces, the carriers were removed from the media and swabbed with a sterile contact swabs. Subsequently, the removed bacterial biofilm was placed in a saline solution with 0.1% (

 <italic class="italic">Asaia</italic> spp. were counted and the results expressed as colony forming units per square centimeter (CFU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were determined. Additionally, the number of bacterial cells in the culture medium was evaluated, and the results expressed as colony forming units per milliliter of medium (CFU/mL). From the obtained values, the relative adhesion coefficient A (%) was calculated using the formula A (%) = (N
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>/N
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>) × 100%, where N
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> is the number of attached cells to a carrier, and N
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> is the number of planktonic cells in the culture medium. For luminometric analysis, the carriers were removed from the media, washed with sterile distilled water and swabbed with pens for ATP (adenosine triphosphate) sampling. Measurements were made using a HY-LiTE
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>2 luminometer (Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The results are expressed as Relative Light Units per square centimeter (RLU/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of carrier.
