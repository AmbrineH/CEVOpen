 <p> The effect of 10% ( v/ v) M. piperita L. mint extract (ME) on the adhesion of As. bogorensis (ISD1, ISD2, FFMW) and As. lannensis (IFCW, FMW1, W4). ( A) Results of the plate count method. ( B) Results of the luminometric method. Results obtained for control samples (without mint extract) were compared with results for samples with 10% ( v/ v) mint extract using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The values with different letters are statistically different ( p &lt; 0.05). a— p ≥ 0.05; b—0.005 &lt; p &lt; 0.05; c— p &lt; 0.005. The results were compared with data received for the control medium. </p>
