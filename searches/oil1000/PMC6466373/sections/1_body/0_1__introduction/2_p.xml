<p class="p">An important aspect concerning the use of insect meal as a feed ingredient, related to human and animal health, is the possible accumulation of mineral elements in the insect body during the growing cycle. Some elements (Cu, Se, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni) are essential for biological functions, but the heavy metals like Cd, Pb, Hg, and As can induce adverse effects due to their potential toxicity and bioaccumulation in the food chain [

 <xref rid="B16-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Therefore, monitoring of toxic elements concentrations, in the insect meal and diets, is necessary from the point of view of both nutrition and contamination. The few studies on the mineral profile of insect meals [
