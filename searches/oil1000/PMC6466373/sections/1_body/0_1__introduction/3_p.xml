 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> (HI) larvae meal from 16 to 40 weeks of age were investigated. Thus, the aim of the present research was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of a partially defatted meal from HI larvae in the diet on the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production in the caeca, intestinal morphometry, and brush border enzymatic activity of 40 weeks old layers. In addition, the research aimed to contribute to the knowledge of the trace and toxic elementsâ€™ concentration in insect meals.
