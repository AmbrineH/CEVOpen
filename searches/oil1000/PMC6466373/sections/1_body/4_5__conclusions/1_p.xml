<p class="p">The inclusion of an insect meal from HI larvae as 25 or 50% substitution of the proteins from the soybean meal influenced the small intestine morphometry and enzymatic activity, as well as the caecal microbial activity. The SBM group had the highest intestinal functionality, while some compensatory mechanism, probably mediated by the chitin, led to a positive increase of the VFAs and butyrate in the HM50 diet with potential positive effects on the gut healthiness. However, considering the results of Bovera et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], to which these results are strongly linked, it is possible to conclude that the 25% soybean protein replacement with the 
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> larvae meal in the diet of laying hens is more suitable and closer to the optimal level than 50% replacement. Finally, the levels of Cd, Pb, Hg, and As in the diets and insect meal were always lower compared to MLs of heavy metals set by the EU Commission for the feeding stuff and feed materials. This latter aspect provides important information on the safe use of these alternative ingredients in animal feeding.
