The intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) activities were determined on the supernatant using two commercial kits (Paramedical, Pontecagnano Faiano, SA, Italy) as indicated by the manufacturer. The total protein concentration was determined according to Bradford [

One unit (U) of enzyme activity corresponded to the amount of enzyme that transforms or hydrolyzes 1 μmole of substrate mL
