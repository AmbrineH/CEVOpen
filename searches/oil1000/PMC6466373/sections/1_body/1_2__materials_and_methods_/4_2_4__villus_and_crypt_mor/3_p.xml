Cross sections (5 µm) at an interval of 200 µm were stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin and eosin and examined under Zeiss Axio Imager.A2 microscope for the histopathological assay. For the morphometric analysis of villus and crypts, ten randomly chosen microscopic fields from each section of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were acquired using a microscope combined color digital camera Axiocam 503 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and the measurements were performed using the Zen 2.3 lite software.
