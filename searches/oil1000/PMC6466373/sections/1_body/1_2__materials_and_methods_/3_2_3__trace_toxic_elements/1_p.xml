 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Trace elements concentrations were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) technique using a Perkin Elmer Optima 2100 DV instrument coupled with a CETAC U5000AT. The calibration curve and two blanks were run during each set of analyses, to check the purity of the chemicals. A reference material (CRM DORM-4, National Research Council of Canada (NRC-CNRC), Ottawa (Ontario), Canada) was also included for quality control. All the values of the reference materials were within the certified limits. The instrumental detection limits are expressed as wet weight (w.w.) and were determined following the protocol described by Perkin Elmer ICP application study number 57 [
