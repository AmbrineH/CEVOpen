<p class="p">A total of 162, sixteen weeks old Hy-line Brown hens (average live weight 1.41 kg ± 0.13 standard deviation) were equally divided into three experimental groups, differing for the dietary treatment. The control group was fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet (SBM group) formulated to meet the hens’ nutrients requirements according to the Hy-line Brown commercial line management guide 2016 [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In the other groups, the soybean meal was partially replaced by a partially defatted insect meal obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic> larvae (HI, Hermetia Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co KG, Amtsgericht Potsdam, Germany) in order to formulate two isoproteic and isoenergetic diets. In the HI25 group, the 25% of the dietary protein was replaced by the HI protein (inclusion level of the HI in the diet 7.3%); in the HI50 group, the 50% of the dietary protein was replaced by the protein of the HI (inclusion level 14.6%). The hens were housed in the same building in modified cages (800 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/hen), under controlled temperature (25 °C ± 0.3 °C) and humidity (64% ± 1.2%) conditions. For each group, the hens were distributed into 3 cages (18 hens/cage), and each cage was divided by 2 internal transects into 3 equal areas, to obtain 9 replicates of 6 hens per group. Feed and water were manually distributed, and appropriate separations were placed along the trough and the line of the egg collection to control the feed intake and the egg production per each replicate. The dark:light cycle was 9:15 hours.
