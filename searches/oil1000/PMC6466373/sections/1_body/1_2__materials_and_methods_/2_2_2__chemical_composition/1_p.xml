<p class="p">The main protein sources (soybean and insect meal) and the diets were analyzed for the chemical composition according to the AOAC official methods [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The metabolizable energy of the diets was calculated according to the NRC estimation procedure [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], while the apparent metabolizable energy of the insect meal used in the present trial was obtained from the studies of De Marco et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The data on the amino acids, minerals, and metabolizable energy values of all the ingredients were supplied by the respective producers and used to calculate the correspondent contents in the diets. The amount of protein linked to the acid detergent fiber (ADF) was determined [
 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]; and only for the insect meal, it was used to estimate the amount of chitin, according to Marono et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] as follows: chitin (%) = ash free ADF (%) âˆ’ ADF-linked protein (%). The chemical-nutritional characteristics of the two protein sources are reported in
