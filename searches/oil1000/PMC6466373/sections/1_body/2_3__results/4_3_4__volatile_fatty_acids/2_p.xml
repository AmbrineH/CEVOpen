<p class="p">In 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00086-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, the VFAs content is also expressed as a percentage of the total VFAs. In this case, the isobutyrate had a higher production in the caeca of the hens fed the HI diets compared to the control (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), the butyrate in the HI50 group was higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than the control, while the valerianic acid in control was higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) than both the HI groups. The contrast analysis showed a significant linear effect for butyrate and isovalerianic acids (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and for the valerianic acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). For valerianic acid, the quadratic effect was also significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
