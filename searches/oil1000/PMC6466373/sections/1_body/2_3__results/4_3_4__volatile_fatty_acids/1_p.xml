 <xref rid="animals-09-00086-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> reports the effect of the dietary treatments on the VFAs production in the henâ€™s caeca. The production of acetate and total VFAs (mmol/L) was higher in the caecal content of the hens fed the HI50 diet than in that of the other groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The butyrate content was higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the HI50 than in the SBM group, while the valerianic acid of the hens fed the SBM diet was higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) than those fed both the HI diets. The contrast analysis showed a significant linear effect (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerianic, and valerianic acids.
