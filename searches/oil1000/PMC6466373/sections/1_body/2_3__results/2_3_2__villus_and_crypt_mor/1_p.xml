 <xref rid="animals-09-00086-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the morphometry traits (villi height, crypt depth, and villi/crypt ratio) for each of the three tracts of the small intestine of the hens according to dietary treatments. In the duodenum, villi height and villi/crypt ratio were higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in the SBM than in both HI groups. The contrast analysis showed a significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) linear effect for villi height, while the quadratic effect was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) both for the villi height and villi/crypt. In the jejunum, the villi height and villi/crypt ratio of the hens fed SBM was higher (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) than that of both HI diets. The contrast analysis showed a significant effect for the linear component for the villi height, villi/crypt (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and for the crypt depth (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the ileum, the HI25 group had a higher villi height than the HI50 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the only significant contrast was a linear effect (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.054) for the villi height.
