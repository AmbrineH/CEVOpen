<p class="p">Compared to the MLs of heavy metals set by the EU Commission [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], Cd, Pb, Hg, and As levels in the diets and insect meal were always lower than the maximum values established for the feeding stuff and feed materials. In fact, the EU regulation establishes the following MLs of heavy metals content in mg/kg (ppm) relative to a feed with a moisture content of 12%: the Cd MLs in the feed materials and complete feed are 2.0 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively; the Pb MLs in the feed materials and complete feed are 10.0 and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively; the Hg MLs in the feed materials and complete feed are both 0.1 mg/kg; the As MLs in the feed materials and complete feed are both 2 mg/kg.
