<p class="p">The inclusion of the insect meal in the hens’ diet induced several modifications in the microbial activity in the caeca, as showed by the VFAs production, but the effects were particularly evident with the highest inclusion level (HI50 group). The increased total VFAs production in the latter was mainly due to a higher production of butyrate (+21.5%) and acetate (+13.3%) than in the SBM group, while the valerianic acid decreased in the two groups fed the insect meal. These results completely agree with the finding of Cutrignelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], in which the hens fed an HI meal in total replacement of the soybean proteins showed an increased production of butyrate (+62.6%) and acetate (+36.1%) than the control. Similar to our results, Loponte et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] found an increased amount of the total VFAs (+45.6%), acetate (+40.3%), and butyrate (+64.6%) in broilers fed a 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae meal as a complete replacement of the soybean meal. The increased activity of the microbial population in the caeca can be related to the chitin level of the HI diet, confirming the hypothesis of Loponte et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and Cutrignelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. However, another important point emerging from our research is that the chitin needs to be at a sufficient level to act as “prebiotic”, stimulating the intestinal microbial activity. Based on our analysis and taking into account the formula proposed by Marono et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] for the estimation of the insect chitin from the chemical composition, the amount of the chitin in the 
 <italic class="italic">H. illucens</italic> larvae meal used in this trial was 6.64% as feed. The feed intake of the hens involved in this trial, and reported by Bovera et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], was 99.97, 97.69, and 101.9 g/day, respectively, for the SBM, HI25, and HI50 groups. Thus, considering the inclusion level in the diets, the HI25 group ingested around 0.47 g/d of chitin, while the HI50 group ingested around 0.99 g/d. Our hypothesis is that the lowest level of chitin is not sufficient to modulate the microbial population activity in the hens. The butyric acid is considered to be the main enterocytes energy source [
 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], and it is also necessary for the proper development of the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. It is reported that the VFAs, in general, have a bacteriostatic effect against some enteric bacteria, including 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and, in particular, the butyrate is related to the decreased amounts of Enterobacteriaceae in chickens [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Thus, both the increases in the total VFAs and butyric acid can improve, through different mechanisms, the health of the hens’ intestine.
