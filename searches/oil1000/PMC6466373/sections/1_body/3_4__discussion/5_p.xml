<p class="p">The presence of HI meals in the diet did not affect the activity of both the disaccharases except for the maltase in the duodenum of the hens fed the highest level of HI meal. Recently, Khol et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] showed that the activity of maltase in the small intestine of mallard, chicken, and quail varied depending on the species and, in the mallard, on the intestinal tract. Working with geese, they also demonstrated an effect of the interaction with the protein and the fiber content of the diet, with the highest activity of maltase registered in the Low Protein-Low Fiber group. Likewise, in the present study, the limiting action of the chitin inside the HI meal on the availability of starch during the digestion process led to lower availability of substrate for the maltase activity.
