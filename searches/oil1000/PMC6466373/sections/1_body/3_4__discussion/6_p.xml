<p class="p">The linear decrease of IAP in the duodenum and jejunum of the hens as the dietary insect meal inclusion increased, shows that the SBM group presents the highest intestinal functionality. Similar results have also been observed by Cutrignelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], when the inclusion of HI larvae meal as 50% substitution of soybean meal protein in laying hens decreased the IAP levels in the jejunum and ileum. This enzyme is considered an excellent marker for the crypt-villus differentiation in chicken [
