<p class="p">The trace minerals content of the insect meals is still poorly investigated, but it is an important goal to formulate appropriate diets for poultry and avoid a possible excessive excretion into the environment. In addition, the knowledge of the potential accumulation of toxic elements is mandatory to guarantee humans and animals safety. A recent study showed that the concentration of many minerals (magnesium, calcium, iodine, iron, sodium, and potassium) in black soldier fly larvae increased linearly as the level of the correspondent mineral in the growing substrate increased, while manganese remained stable in the larvae, despite varying concentrations in the media [

 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], and thus it is difficult to compare our results to the available data. The discrepancy of the results is tied to the different kind of substrates used for the insectsâ€™ growth but also, for some other elements as Zn, to the technological process following the larvae harvesting. However, the concentrations of Co, Ni, and Se found in the edible insect of our trial were lower than those of the conventional food. The insect meal had a higher amount of Zn, considering the inclusion level, so the only insect meal supplied a daily amount of Zn (331.1 and 662.3 mg/kg, respectively, for HI25 and HI diets) exceeding the correspondent requirements indicated by Hy-Line Brown commercial layers management guide [
