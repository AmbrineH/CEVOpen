<p class="p">Very interesting are the significant changes in the mutual proportions of the butyric, isobutyric, and valerianic acid observed, which might indicate that not only the activity but also the interactions among the different microbial species have been modified. This is in accordance with the findings by Borrelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], who observed changes in the gut microbiota of hens fed HI larvae meal. In particular, these authors found a strong correlation between levels of the bacteria strains 
 <italic class="italic">Flavonifractor plautii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Christensenella minuta</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Alkaliphilus transvaalensis</italic> and high production of propionate, butyrate, and total VFAs; these bacteria are the principal contributors to Î²-N-acetylhexosaminidases and N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate deacetylase production, and these enzymes represent the key enzymes responsible for a higher VFAs production.
