<p id="Par25" class="p">Straw is a lignocellulosic agricultural residue with great potential as feedstock in biotechnological production processes (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). As it is co-produced with cereal grain and other food raw materials, its production does not compete with food production and will not result in land-use changes. Substantial research towards converting this feedstock to biofuels and other high-value compounds has been conducted during the last years. There is a long and growing list of interesting chemicals that can be generated from straw materials (Chandel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2018</xref>; Gupta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>). Given the high dependency of the global economy on fossil resources, there is an urgent need to find alternative ways of producing fuels, chemicals and food. Moreover, producing high-value compounds from agricultural residues will add value to the agricultural industry, increasing the economic attractiveness of green technologies. Establishing technologies to produce different fuels and chemicals from straw will create opportunities for generating products best adapted to the local conditions and market demands. Frequently, production of more than one biofuel can be combined, such as ethanol and biogas or biodiesel and biogas (Karlsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>; Lantz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2018</xref>). The whole chemical complexity of the biomass should be used, if possible. Lignin is an underutilised resource, but there are ongoing efforts to identify enzymes to degrade and utilise this biopolymer as well (Gupta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>). On the other hand, lignin is currently often burned to provide process energy. It can also be transferred back to the soil to maintain the soil organic carbon content and, in the long term, to prevent greenhouse gas emissions (Karlsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>; Karlsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2017</xref>; Lantz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2018</xref>). For any application, a careful analysis of both environmental and economic consequences has to be performed to obtain a sustainable replacement for fossil resources.
