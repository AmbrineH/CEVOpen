<p id="Par18" class="p">Lignocellulose is in general a problematic substrate for biogas production. Apart from its recalcitrant structure, it has a comparatively high C/N ratio and it has a shortage of essential trace elements such as iron, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, selenium and tungsten. Keeping the C/N ratio between 20 and 30 is crucial for running an efficient biogas process; however, straw feedstocks have C/N ratios of 46 and 47 (oat straw and rice straw, respectively) to 60 and 63 (wheat straw and corn stover, respectively). On the other hand, low C/N ratio feedstocks such as animal waste are also problematic, as they can result in digester instability due to ammonia toxicity. Those problems can partially be overcome by running co-digestion of lignocellulose and animal waste products (Sawatdeenarunat et al.

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). For instance, co-digestion of rice straw and swine manure resulted in an increase in methane production by 71% (Ye et al.
