<p id="Par9" class="p">It is also possible to perform biopretreatment, where the biomass is degraded with the help of microorganisms. A huge variety of both bacteria and fungi can degrade cellulose and hemicellulose to their monomers. Certain Clostridia, e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium thermocellum</italic>, have been extensively investigated for anaerobic degradation of cellulose. Actinomycetes and a variety of fungi can degrade cellulose and hemicellulose under aerobic conditions (Lynd et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2002</xref>). However, microbes usually consume the monosaccharides that are released during hydrolysis, and thus, sugars are typically not available for subsequent conversion to biofuels. In one study, this was overcome by co-incubation of 
 <italic class="italic">C. thermocellum</italic> with a thermostable β-glucosidase. 
 <italic class="italic">C. thermocellum</italic> usually takes up cellodextrins and has a rather low affinity for glucose. Due to the activity of β-glucosidase, monomeric glucose was produced from the oligosaccharides that were generated from cellulose by the clostridial cellulase activity. The combination of 
 <italic class="italic">C. thermocellum</italic> and glucosidase resulted in considerable accumulation of glucose both on pure cellulose and rice straw hydrolysate (Prawitwong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2013</xref>). Microbial lignin degradation is another strategy to make the polysaccharides more accessible to enzyme degradation. Delignification has been attempted using white-rot fungi such as 
 <italic class="italic">Trametes versicolor</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Phanerochaete chrysosporium</italic> or isolated lignin-degrading enzymes such as laccases. This kind of pretreatment is often time consuming when using living fungi and requires additional processes such as detoxification (Plácido and Capareda 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2015</xref>). Moreover, experiments with biopretreatment require moistening of the material and in most cases start with sterilised material (e.g. Cianchetta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2014</xref>), which would not be sustainable for large-scale production of biofuels and chemicals. Moist straw is quite susceptible to mould infection (Passoth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2013</xref>). Straw is usually dried in the field, which implies that rainfall can affect drying and thus later utilisation of the material (Nilsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2000</xref>). Establishing a low energy preservation system would enable even the utilisation of moist straw and thus increase the amount of raw materials accessible for straw-based production of biofuels in areas with high precipitation. Potential useful preservation systems have been developed for moist cereals, using airtight storage together with biocontrol organisms. This kind of biopreservation efficiently inhibited the growth of undesirable microbes and improved the grain characteristics for use as animal feed, such as decreased amounts of phytate (Olstorpe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2010</xref>; Olstorpe and Passoth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2011</xref>). Moreover, the starch was better accessible for enzymatic degradation, resulting in improved bioethanol production from moist stored cereals (Passoth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2009</xref>). The concept of airtight preservation was extended to wheat straw. Biopreservation of wheat straw with the help of appropriate biocontrol yeasts prevented mould infections, and there was even enhanced biofuel production from the biopreserved moist straw compared to dry material, indicating that biopreservation during storage can also be a part of the pretreatment (Passoth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2013</xref>; Theuretzbacher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2015</xref>).
