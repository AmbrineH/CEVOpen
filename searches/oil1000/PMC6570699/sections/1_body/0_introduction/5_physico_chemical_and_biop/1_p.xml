<p id="Par7" class="p">The recalcitrance of straw necessitates pretreatment to obtain monosaccharides that can be fermented to biofuels and chemicals. Technologies for pretreating lignocellulose were developed already in the early nineteenth century, in pulp and paper production and in agriculture, to increase the digestibility of forage by ruminants. In most approaches, the material is first size reduced followed by some type of physico-chemical treatment. The pretreated lignocellulose is subsequently enzymatically saccharified (Rabemanolontsoa and Saka
