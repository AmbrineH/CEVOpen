<p id="Par20" class="p">Butanol, both 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanol and iso-butanol, has excellent fuel characteristics because it has higher energy density, is less corrosive and more compatible with existing engines than ethanol. Acetone-butanol-ethanol production from starchy material has been established on an industrial scale using solventogenic Clostridia (Xin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">2018</xref>). However, the process suffers from high costs for raw materials and too low final titres of butanol. Butanol is highly toxic to cells; thus in batch culture, the maximum butanol titres were less than 13 g/l (Mariano et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2011</xref>). Conversion of lignocellulosic materials to butanol has been tested, using metabolically engineered Clostridia, adding cellulolytic enzymes to fermentations or by using mixed cultures of the solventogenic Clostridia with cellulolytic bacteria. For instance, 5.5 g/l butanol could be produced from rice straw, and 10.9 g/l from corncobs. Although certain progress was made, the final butanol titres and production rates did not reach the levels necessary for commercially viable butanol production (Jiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2017</xref>; Jiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2018</xref>). Optimising lignocellulose hydrolysis and detoxification could further increase butanol production from various lignocellulose substrates; about 18 g/l were reached from barley straw, hydrolysed by dilute acid and enzyme treatment and detoxified by overliming. The fermentation strain was 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium beijerinckii</italic> P260. Optimising process parameters could further increase butanol production. Fed-batch cultivation with immobilised cells (high cell densities) and continuous removal of the butanol was most promising. A final concentration of 115 g/l butanol was reached in a fed-batch fermentation of wheat straw hydrolysate with 
 <italic class="italic">C. beijerinckii</italic> P260, where butanol was continuously removed by gas stripping (Gottumukkala et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2017</xref>).
