<p id="Par15" class="p">As mentioned above (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), straw can be used as animal feed, for bedding, as substrate for mushroom cultivation or for burning (Panoutsou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2017</xref>; Townsend et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2017</xref>). Complete removal of the straw from the field is not desirable, since this over the long term decreases the amount of soil carbon in the fields (Karlsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2017</xref>; Townsend et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, even after considering all these alternative utilisations, there is a surplus of straw that can be used in a biorefinery, although the annual amounts of available straw can vary, depending on for instance weather conditions and chosen cultivars (Scarlat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2010</xref>; Talebnia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2010</xref>). There are a variety of methods to further convert the monosaccharides derived from straw pretreatment to biofuels, including ethanol, methane (biogas), butanol or biodiesel (Chandel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2018</xref>).
