<p id="Par3" class="p">Straw includes dried stalks, ears, cobs and leaves of e.g. cereals, rapeseed or sunflower, which are separated from the grains during harvest (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). For instance corn stover, i.e. leaves, stalks and bare cobs from maize plants, is the most abundant straw generated in the USA (Panoutsou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2017</xref>). Straw has multiple applications such as animal feed, bedding, substrate for mushroom production or power generation by burning. Nevertheless, there is a substantial surplus of straw. In several areas of the world, this surplus straw is frequently removed from the fields by open field burning. This technique, although quite convenient for the farmer, causes substantial emissions affecting the environmental balance of cereal production and the local air quality. Therefore, there are efforts to ban open field burning (Kadam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2000</xref>). Biofuel production from straw can add value to this residue and reduce the consumption of fossil resources. It is not completely clear how much of the straw can be sustainably removed from fields, as there are a variety of factors impacting the amount of available straw, for instance cultivation conditions, grain cultivar, weather conditions or soil quality (Panoutsou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2017</xref>; Townsend et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2017</xref>). For wheat straw, about 400 million tons may be globally available for biofuel production (Talebnia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2010</xref>; Tishler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">2015</xref>). New preservation techniques for moist straw material (Passoth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2013</xref>) may in some areas with high precipitation increase the amount of potentially available material (Nilsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2000</xref>).
