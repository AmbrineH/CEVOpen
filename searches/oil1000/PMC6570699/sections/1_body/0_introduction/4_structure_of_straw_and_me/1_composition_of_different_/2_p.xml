<p id="Par6" class="p">Apart from organic polymers, straw also contains inorganic compounds, which after burning remain as ash. While the ash content is rather low in for instance wheat, oat or barley straw, it has a proportion of up to 20% of the total biomass in rice straw. The major element within the ash is Si. Amorphous Si polymers have been observed to form incrustations in epidermis, vascular bundle, bundle sheath and sclerenchyma tissues (Satlewal et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2015</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that rice plants treated with silica reduce lignin incorporation in their cell walls (Goto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2003</xref>). Silica may fulfil the function of lignin as a compression-resistant compound in cell walls. Its incorporation takes less than 10% of the energy of incorporating lignin or carbohydrates into the cell wall (Satlewal et al.
