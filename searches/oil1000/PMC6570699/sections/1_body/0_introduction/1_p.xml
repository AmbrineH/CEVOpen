<p id="Par2" class="p">Biofuels, i.e. reduced liquid or gaseous compounds generated from renewable organic biomass, are seen as a means to decrease dependency on fossil resources, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions especially in the transportation sector and improve security of fuel supply (Passoth

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, biofuels are currently mainly produced from so-called first-generation substrates such as sugar cane, wheat grain or vegetable oils, i.e. resources that also can be used as human food. This use of food crops has been criticised due to potential food versus fuel competition and because land-use changes can lead to the loss of natural ecosystems (Kim and Dale 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2004</xref>; Kluts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2017</xref>). Therefore, substantial research has been conducted to establish biofuel production from second-generation biomass, i.e. lignocellulose such as straw or wood residues (Gnansounou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2010</xref>). Nevertheless, even lignocellulosic energy crops can compete with food production as areas are needed to produce those plants (Kluts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2017</xref>). On marginal i.e. poor yielding land, the yield of dedicated energy crops is usually also poor; hence, production costs are probably high and the revenue low. There are many factors determining whether it is profitable to produce food or biofuels. If biofuel production is profitable, energy crops might be produced instead of food plants (Glithero et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sims et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">2010</xref>). In contrast, cereal straw may represent an ideal resource for biofuel production, as it is a co-product of food production, and thus, its production does not compete with food generation (Townsend et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2017</xref>) and a high level of grain production did not have any negative effect on the utilisation of the straw as raw materials for biofuel production (JÃ¸rgensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2018</xref>).
