<p id="Par22" class="p">Production of high-value biodiesel and co-products will also be a means to reach competitive production prices. By fermentation with 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodotorula toruloides</italic> and subsequent catalytic hydrogenation, hydrocarbons with identical characteristics to fossil diesel could be generated from corn stover (Sànchez i Nogué et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2018</xref>). The red colour of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodotorula</italic> species is due to the formation of carotenoids, mainly β-carotene. Carotenes are widely used as colourants and antioxidants in the food, feed, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Co-production with lipids can improve the economic viability of biodiesel production (Schneider et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2013</xref>). Furfural is another high-value compound that can be produced from wheat straw. This dehydration product of pentoses is one major platform chemical to produce biofuels, fuel additives and other compounds. It is a side product of thermochemical pretreatment and acts as an inhibitor in the fermentation broth. Currently, there is no technology for synthetic furfural production; it has to be produced from lignocellulose. Current technologies for furfural production are not very efficient and they damage the cellulose, so that its glucose monomers cannot be converted to biofuels (Machado et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2016</xref>). At Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry, a novel technique for furfural extraction has been developed, allowing an efficient extraction of furfural from lignocellulosic material without extensively damaging the cellulose fraction. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to co-produce furfural and ethanol or lipids (from 1 kg straw, 110 g furfural—69% of the theoretical maximum—and 111 g ethanol or 33 g lipids were produced). Pentoses were in principle completely converted to furfural, and the hydrolysate contained the easily fermentable glucose. Moreover, the hydrolysate had a low content of fermentation inhibitors (Brandenburg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2018</xref>). It is also possible to utilise the lipids of oleaginous yeasts for other purposes, for instance as ingredient in fish feed, to replace vegetable oil such as palm oil. As it is not necessary to extract the oil or to run transesterification, this approach can also be a valuable step towards a sustainable economy, taking into account the environmental impact of palm oil production (see above) (Blomqvist et al.
