<p id="Par24" class="p">1,4-Butandiol is another large-volume chemical that is currently mainly produced from fossil resources. It has a global market of about two million tons per year and has a range of applications as platform chemical for the production of plastics and other products. 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> has been engineered to produce 1,4-butandiol from a variety of sugars with comparatively high yield and productivity in a commercial scale (Burgard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2016</xref>). LCA showed a positive effect compared to production from fossil resources. However, also negative effects were observed, including terrestrial acidification and marine eutrophication because of ammonia fertilisation during production of biomass (Forte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2016</xref>). The impact of biomass production on the environmental sustainability needs to be regarded to exploit the full potential of utilising straw as raw material for the production of biofuels and biochemicals.
