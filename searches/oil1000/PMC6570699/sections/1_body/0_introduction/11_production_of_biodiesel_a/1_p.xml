<p id="Par21" class="p">After ethanol, biodiesel is currently the second most abundant biofuel in the world. Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oil, for instance rape seed, palm or soya oil. The production of vegetable oil can have a considerable greenhouse gas potential, for instance the production of one ton of palm or soya oil results in the emission of more than 2000 kg CO

Microbial lipids produced from lignocellulose such as straw can provide a sustainable alternative to vegetable oils. Oleaginous yeasts can accumulate more than 20% of their biomass as lipids; lipid contents of more than 70% have been reported. Lipid accumulation occurs at carbon surplus, for instance due to high C/N ratios, which are characteristic for straw hydrolysates (see above in “Biogas from straw”). At carbon surplus, the citrate cycle is inhibited in oleaginous yeasts, and citrate is transported out of the mitochondria. In the cytoplasm, citrate is converted by ATP citrate lyase to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The latter is transported back to the mitochondria, while acetyl-CoA is the basis of fatty acid synthesis, which is achieved by acetyl-CoA carboxylase and the fatty acid synthase (FAS) enzyme complex, under consumption of NADPH. Many oleaginous yeasts can convert the different hexoses and pentoses and organic acids released from lignocellulose pretreatment to lipids (Passoth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2017b</xref>; Sitepu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2014</xref>). Lipid production from different lignocellulosic materials has been tested, including rice straw (final lipid concentration 11.5 g/l) (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2009</xref>) or corncob hydrolysate (final lipid concentration 12.3 g/l) (Gao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2014</xref>). From corn stover hydrolysate, 25–30 g/l was reached (Slininger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2016</xref>). Inhibitors in the hydrolysate act also against oleaginous yeasts, setting a limit for feedstock dry matter in the fermentation process, which in turn limits the amount of potential end product. Lipid-accumulating strains may be adapted to inhibitors by sophisticated feeding techniques. Brandenburg et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2016</xref>) discovered that the oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Lipomyces starkeyi</italic> was co-consuming acetic acid and xylose, thus increasing the pH in cultivations without pH adjustment. When the medium feed was connected to pH regulation, a self-regulating fed batch could be established, yielding the highest lipid concentration to date from the hemicellulose fraction of lignocellulose. In oleaginous 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodosporidium</italic> spp. (current correct taxonomic designation 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodotorula</italic>, Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">2015</xref>), fed-batch cultivation yielded the highest production levels on lignocellulose hydrolysate (Xu and Liu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">2017</xref>), indicating that strains can adapt to fermentation inhibitors. However, the production price of lignocellulosic microbial biodiesel would still be too high; according to recent calculations, a minimum selling price of about $ 2.50 would be required to cover the costs (Biddy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2016</xref>). On the other hand, microbial biodiesel production from lignocellulose has the potential to reach a similar energy balance as bioethanol (Karlsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>). A number of steps in the production process of microbial biodiesel could be improved, which would significantly increase the efficiency of the whole process. This includes lipid extraction from the cells, identification of rapid lipid producers (since lipid production is an aerobic process, requiring much more energy per fermentation time compared to the in principle anaerobic ethanol production process), utilising all residues to generate co-products (such as biogas), and conversion of the crude glycerol, which is a residue of the transesterification of the microbial triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters, to lipids (Biddy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2016</xref>; Karlsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>).
