<p id="Par23" class="p">Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), which is produced by certain bacteria as intracellular storage compound. PHAs can be used as bioplastics, replacing fossil-based plastics produced from mineral oil components. Production of PHAs by microorganisms has been investigated during the last years; however, production costs were usually too high to achieve a substantial replacement of plastic from fossil resources. Identification of cheap carbon sources for the microbial production of PHA may be one approach to decrease production costs. AFEX-pretreated wheat straw was used for PHB production with
