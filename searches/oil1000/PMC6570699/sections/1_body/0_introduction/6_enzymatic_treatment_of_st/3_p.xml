<p id="Par12" class="p">Less than 10Â years ago, a new class of enzymes were discovered that act synergistically with glycoside hydrolase enzymes and play an important role in degradation of polysaccharides (Vaaje-Kolstad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">2010</xref>). These lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) cleave glucose in a copper-mediated oxidative process at the C1 and/or the C4 position of a glucan chain (Meier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2018</xref>). Activities of some LPMOs on hemicellulose have also been observed (Gupta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2016</xref>). LPMOs generate chain breaks in the polysaccharide molecule, yielding additional sites for GH-enzyme activity. Due to the synergistic action of LPMOs and GHs, a lower enzyme load can be used for degrading lignocellulosic biomass, which is an important step towards economically feasible lignocellulose conversion (Obeng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2017</xref>). LPMOs are classified as auxiliary activities (AA) in the CAZy classification system (Lombard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>; Meier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2018</xref>).
