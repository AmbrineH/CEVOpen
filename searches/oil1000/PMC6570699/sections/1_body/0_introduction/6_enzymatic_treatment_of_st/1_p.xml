<p id="Par10" class="p">After physico-chemical pretreatment, monosaccharides are released from the polysaccharides by using enzymes. For obtaining a maximum release of sugar monomers, enzymes should be used that degrade all three major polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin (Gupta et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, due to a lack of good lignin-degrading enzymes, commercial enzyme mixtures usually degrade cellulose and hemicellulose (Jaramillo et al.
