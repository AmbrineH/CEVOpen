<p id="Par11" class="p">Traditionally, three complementary enzyme activities have been used to degrade cellulose: endoglucanases, exoglucanases and β-glucosidases (Payne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2015</xref>). These enzymes are classified as belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) families in the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) classification system (Lombard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>). Endoglucanases (endo-1,4-β-D-glucanases, EC 3.2.1.4) hydrolyse β-1,4 glycosidic bonds in a random manner in amorphous areas of the cellulose, generating reducing and non-reducing ends. Exoglucanases, also called cellobiohydrolases (cellulose 1,4-β-cellobiosidases) are processive enzymes (i.e. they slide along the polysaccharide chain) releasing cellobiose from either the reducing (E.C 3.2.1.176) or the non-reducing end (EC 3.2.1.91) of the cellulose molecule. β-Glucosidases (E.C. 3.2.1.21) hydrolyse cellobiose or cellooligosaccharides into glucose. Both exoglucanases and β-glucosidases are strongly inhibited by the end product of their reactions, cellobiose and glucose, respectively (Gupta et al.
