<p id="p0075" class="p">The drilling fluid characteristic-algorithm, that predicts the interaction of the mud system and formation were developed to determine the ability of the fluids to successfully drill the particular hole-section under consideration. The following test data were considered and applied in developing the model; bulk hardness, dispersion and accretion testing, linear swelling, cation exchange capacity and data from X-Ray diffraction tests. The analyzed test results served as the input data for the model algorithms for the fluid selection model (

This helps the well-engineer to analyze and compare the performance of the selected mud system and its interaction with the wellbore formation.
