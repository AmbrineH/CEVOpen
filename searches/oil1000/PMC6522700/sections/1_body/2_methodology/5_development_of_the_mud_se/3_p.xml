<p id="p0065" class="p">The applied drilling fluid-algorithms were developed through tests such as bulk hardness, dispersion, accretion, linear swelling and immersion, capillary suction, X-ray diffraction, and cation exchange capacity tests, in order to determine the ability of the fluids to successfully drill the characterized formation. The analyses of these test results served as the governing algorithms for the drilling fluid selection for each hole-section. Using the developed algorithms, a computer model was developed using Microsoft visual basic programming language. The data for the variables incorporated into the fluid selection algorithm were obtained from the literature (
