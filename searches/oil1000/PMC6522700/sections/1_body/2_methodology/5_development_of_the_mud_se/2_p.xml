<p id="p0060" class="p">The drilling fluid system was developed based on the type of well to be drilled. The overkill mud system was designed for an exploratory well while an optimum mud system was designed for a developing well. A real-time fluid selection tool was developed through the integration of the formation data and geological composition in the drilling fluid characteristic-algorithm. The model development flow chart is presented in
