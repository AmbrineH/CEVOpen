<p id="p0070" class="p">There are many drilling fluid additives which are used to develop the key properties of the muds. The varieties of fluid additives reflect the complexities inherent in mud systems currently in use. Mud complexity often poses more difficulty and challenge when under the confines of unfavourable drilling conditions. Weighted materials are used to increase the density of water or oil-based drilling fluids. Most of these materials are insoluble and require Viscosifiers to get them suspended in a mud system. Mud weights higher than that of water whose average specific gravity is 8.3 ppg are required to control formation pressures. 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">TableÂ 1</xref> shows the fluid selection model algorithms developed using the fluid test results; based on algorithms, a computer model was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic programming language for the accurate prediction of mud density for 3 different runs.
