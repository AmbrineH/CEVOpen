<p id="p0015" class="p">The drive for automation in drilling operations can be attributed to: data overload from real-time tools, well complexity, knowledge transfers from skilled personnel to nonprofessionals, and the potential economic benefits therein as compared to when the process is operated manually. The past fifteen years have witnessed a push in automation within the oilfield-drilling industry. The automation involves the drilling of wellbores using systems and subsystems controlled by computer programs to some degree. 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Endsley and Kaber (1999)</xref> noted that complementation of automation with some sense of human judgment enhances performance. This is adjudged true in the area of drilling and well engineering because drilling automation comprises of a hierarchy of subsystems which is not entirely independent of human intervention.
