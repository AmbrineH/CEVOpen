<p id="p0025" class="p">Software models are now being developed to monitor and predict data in real time which make-up the automation spectrum while drilling oil/gas wells. These models monitor the drilling process, deliver advice to the drilling team and set points for the hardware or even take direct control of the hardware operations in some cases. When planning a well construction, post-drilling information and analyses still remain essential components; however, the information gathered holds greater value when used for validation.</p>
