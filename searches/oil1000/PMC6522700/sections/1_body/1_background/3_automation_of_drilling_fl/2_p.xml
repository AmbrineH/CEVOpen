<p id="p0030" class="p">The most significant effort on drilling fluids automation has been on real-time monitoring of the rheological properties of the fluid while drilling. Based on recent advances in drilling technology, the oil and gas industry has the mandate to develop robust, automated equipment to measure critical fluid properties and type, for drilling purposes as it relates to specific hole-sections. 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Geehan and Zamora (2010)</xref> discussed extensively, on the ultimate success of drilling fluid automation where they itemized the conditions for success as largely dependent on data optimization obtained from real-time monitoring of data management systems connected to interpretation-schemes and prediction analyzers that will convert the collected data into useful knowledge.
