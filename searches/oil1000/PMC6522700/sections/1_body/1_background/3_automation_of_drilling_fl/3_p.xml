<p id="p0035" class="p">One of the major assumptions for automated wellbore drilling fluid selection systems is the availability of accurate, consistent and complete information. Because, the more the available data, the more accurate the generated results. Operators have indicated interest in developing automated drilling fluid selection tools with focus on their total integration in drilling automated systems. Part of the drilling fluid mixing process has been automated in some North Sea rigs. Examples of existing automated systems on North Sea rigs are drilling fluid/bulk transfer systems, and drilling fluid density regulation systems. Rig site engineers’ benefit from the automation of the drilling process which helps to simultaneously oversee more than one well for remote operating engineers. Wellbore instability challenges contribute to non-productive time which subsequently results in high amounts of drilling costs (

Wellbore formation has different pressure windows, and these pressure windows apply to different ranges of equivalent drilling fluid densities that should be used during drilling operations. The referred pressure window is determined by two boundaries which are the fracture pressure and formation pressure. Thus, each formation section requires a specific drilling fluid with distinct properties. A drilling fluid with density lower than the pore pressure capacity will result in an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore causing a kick. Also, a drilling fluid density higher than the fracture gradient will cause drilling-induced tensile fractures that will result in loss of drilling mud into the formation.
