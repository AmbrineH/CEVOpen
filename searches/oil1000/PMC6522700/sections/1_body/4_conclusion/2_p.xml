<p id="p0160" class="p">A real-time computer fluid selection Tool has been developed for selecting high-performance drilling fluids with the ability to ensure minimal wellbore instability, thereby reducing non-productive time and overall well cost. This is a significant and novel approach for making Real-Time Drilling Fluid selection as well as well performance evaluation which will in turn, advance drilling automation to new frontiers and subsequently result in increased well productivity and quality towards improved personnel safety for effective risk management. From the findings of this research, the novel-automated drilling fluid selector gave significant levels of accuracies in the range of 95–99% for each mud type (
