 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>b) generated by the proposed Tool, identified the Bentonite/KCl polymer mud as the most environmentally friendly mud among the selected drilling fluids. This implies that the Bentonite/KCl polymer mud is the preferred choice for this hole-section. For the 12.25″ and 8.5” hole-sections, the Tool also selected three high performance drilling fluid systems for both sections (
