<p id="p0140" class="p">The drilling fluid selection tool performance chart (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 7</xref>b) identified 100% Diesel Invert Emulsion mud as the best overall and it is followed by Invert Emulsion Polyolefin based fluid, however, it is not environmentally friendly when compared with the other two drilling fluids. Thus, the Invert Emulsion Polyolefin based fluid becomes the preferred mud system for the hole-sections.
