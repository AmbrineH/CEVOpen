<p id="p0130" class="p">For the 16” Hole-Section, the tool selected three water based drilling fluids that are capable of drilling that particular formation without any wellbore instability (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>a). The mud systems include (i) Bentonite/KCl polymer, (ii) Chrome-lignin based fluid and (iii) Lignosulphate based fluid. Thus, the operator has the option of considering cost and environmental factors such as variations in temperature, pressure and air space around the wellbore since these mud systems are capable of getting the work done without challenges such as wellbore instabilities arising.
