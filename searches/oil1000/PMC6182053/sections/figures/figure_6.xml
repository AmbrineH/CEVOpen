  <p class="p">Toxicity evaluation of oregano oil to normal mouse skins. The dorsal skin of mice was topically treated with 
   <bold class="bold">(A,C,E)</bold> or without 10 mg/ml oregano oil 
   <bold class="bold">(B,D,F)</bold> once a day for three consecutive days. On day 4, the skins were photographed 
   <bold class="bold">(A,B)</bold>, followed by histological examination 
   <bold class="bold">(C,D)</bold>. The skin sections were also TUNEL stained 
   <bold class="bold">(E,F)</bold>. DNase I treated skin samples
