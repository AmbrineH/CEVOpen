 <p> Possible development of bacterial resistance to oregano oil. (A) A. baumannii AF0005, P. aeruginosa IQ0042, and MRSA IQ0064 were passaged for 20 generations each in the presence of indicated MIC doses of oregano oil. The inhibition rate of A. baumannii AF0005 (B), P. aeruginosa IQ0042 (C), or MRSA IQ0064 (D) was unaltered when the bacteria of indicated generations were exposed to oregano oil at an initial MIC concentration. ns, no significance. </p>
