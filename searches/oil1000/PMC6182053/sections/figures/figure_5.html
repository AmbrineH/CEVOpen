 <p> Oregano oil treatment of MRSA USA300 in infected wounds. (A) The change in mean bacterial luminescence of the wounds infected with 5 × 10 6 CFU of USA300 with or without 5 mg/ml oregano oil treatment. (B) Time courses of mean bacterial luminescence of the infected wounds with and without oregano oil treatment. (C) Mean areas under the bacterial luminescence curves in (B). (D) The wounds were treated with grape seed oil (control) or oregano oil once 24 h after infection and bacterial CFU were quantified on day 7 after bacterial inoculation. The data represent means ± SDs ( n = 8). ∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.0001 in the presence vs. absence of 5 mg/ml of oregano oil. </p>
