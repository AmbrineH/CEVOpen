<p class="p">There was no noticeable skin reaction, as visualized with the naked eye, after three consecutive days of oregano oil treatment at 10 mg/ml (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6B</xref>
 </bold>) when compared to untreated skin (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6A</xref>
 </bold>). On the histological levels, the skin maintained an undisturbed structure with a clear layer of healthy epidermal cells on the top of the dermis, indistinguishable to mock-treated skins (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6C,D</xref>
 </bold>). Genotoxicity was next evaluated by a TUNEL assay to examine any DNA damage induced by oregano oil. In comparison with mock-treated controls, there was no any apparent increase of DNA staining in oregano oil-treated skin (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6E,F</xref>
 </bold>), while the staining was readily seen in the positive control in which skin section was treated with DNase I (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6G</xref>
 </bold>). The absence of any oregano oil-induced skin reaction and DNA damage after a 3-day treatment suggests that topical application of oregano oil is neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic to the host.
