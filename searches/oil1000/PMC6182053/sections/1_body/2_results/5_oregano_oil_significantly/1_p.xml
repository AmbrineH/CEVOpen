<p class="p">Gram stain of histological longitudinal section (
 <bold class="bold">Figure

 </bold>) and crossing section (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>
 </bold>) of a representative skin specimen demonstrated the presence of PA01 biofilms at 24 h after bacterial inoculation, as evidenced by abundant bacteria densely clustered together (red) in a highly hydrated extracellular matrix on the surface of skin and in the epidermis (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>
 </bold>, outline in red). In addition, highly resilient microbial assemblies were readily found in the dermis suggesting that the PA01 could infect not only the epidermis but also the dermis within 24 h (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>
 </bold>). In successive bacterial luminescence images of representative wounds infected with 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU of PA01, oregano oil treatment at 10 mg/ml almost completely eradicated bacterial luminescence in 60 min, while luminescence remained unchanged during the same period in untreated mice (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4C,D</xref>
 </bold>). Moreover, there was no recurrence of infection in the following days in oregano oil-treated mice, whereas the mice remained significantly infected in untreated mice in the same experimental period (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4C,D</xref>
 </bold>). An average reduction in bacterial luminescence of 2.9 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and 3.5 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> were achieved in 60 min at a concentration of 5 or 10 mg/ml of oregano oil, respectively (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4E</xref>
 </bold>). On the contrary, bacterial luminescence of the wounds in the absence of oregano oil treatment was almost unaltered with only 0.08 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> reduction during the equivalent period (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4E</xref>
 </bold>, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). A time course study of the mean bacterial luminescence from days 2 to 7 after bacterial inoculation corroborated that the treatment consistently and significantly lowered the luminescence compared to untreated mice during the whole period of the experiment regardless of whether oregano oil was used at 5 or 10 mg/ml (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4F</xref>
 </bold>). The mean areas under the curve (AUC) of the bioluminescence time course were 6.9 × 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> and 2.4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> for oregano oil-treated groups at 5 and 10 mg/ml, respectively, but it was 5.9 × 10
 <sup class="sup">10</sup> for untreated mice (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4G</xref>
 </bold>), representing an 8.6-fold or a 24.6-fold reduction of the AUC in infected burns by oregano oil. We next excised the infected wounds on day 7 to determine bacterial CFU remaining in the wounds. There were 6.7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> and 2.4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU in the wounds treated with oregano oil at a concentration of 5 or 10 mg/ml, respectively, which was significantly lower than the bacterial burden of 6.6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/wound in untreated mice (
