<p class="p">The MIC values of oregano oil against the 13 bacterial strains are shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>. Oregano oil showed a significant antibacterial activity over PBS controls against 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> strains of AF0004, AF0005, IQ0012, and IQ0013 and MRSA strains of AF0003 and IQ0211, with the MICs ranging from 0.08 to 0.16 mg/ml. The MICs were significantly lower than those MICs ranging from 0.32 to 0.64 mg/ml against strains of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and MRSA strains IQ0064, IQ0103, and USA300 (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Oregano oil also exhibited similar antibacterial activities against established biofilms (24-h-old) formed by the 13 bacterial strains within 1 h, with complete inactivation of the biofilms of 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, and MRSA at the concentrations of 0.3, 1.0, and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively, in good agreement with the MIC values for planktonic bacterial cells (

 </bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). The results clearly suggest that oregano oil can overcome the obstacles of biofilms and kill bacteria within as sufficiently as planktonic bacteria, in contrast to antibiotics that kills bacterial biofilms poorly.
