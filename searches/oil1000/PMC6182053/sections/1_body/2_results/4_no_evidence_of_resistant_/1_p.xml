<p class="p">Risk of resistant development was evaluated with three representative strains: 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> AF0005, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> IQ0042, and MRSA IQ0064. The bacteria were cultured up to 20 successive passages in the presence of sub-lethal doses of oregano oil for bacterial inactivation. As shown in

 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> AF0005, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> IQ0042, and MRSA IQ0064 retained susceptibility to the original MIC values of 0.16, 0.32, or 0.56 mg/ml, respectively, after 20 cycles of treatment. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in the survival rates of all the bacterial strains among the cycles 0, 1, and 20 in the three tested strains, after exposure to oregano oil at the MICs for 24 h (
