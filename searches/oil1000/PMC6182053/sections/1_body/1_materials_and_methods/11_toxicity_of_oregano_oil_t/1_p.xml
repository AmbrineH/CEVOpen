<p class="p">To evaluate any possible toxicity of oregano oil to the skin 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>, mice were shaved on the low dorsal skin 24 h prior to application of oregano oil. Oregano oil 
 <italic class="italic">at</italic> 10 mg/ml was applied topically on the shaved area once a day for three consecutive days. Mice treated with PBS served as negative controls. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after the final oregano oil application, and the skin was cross-sectioned using 8 mm biopsy punch for standard histological examination. The tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) were visualized by Hamamatsu Nanozommer 2.0 HT and the images were processed using NDP viewer software.
