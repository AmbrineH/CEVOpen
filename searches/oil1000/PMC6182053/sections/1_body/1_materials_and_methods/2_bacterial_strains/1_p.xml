<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of oregano oil was tested against a panel of MDR bacteria isolated from combat casualties, including seven Gram-negative strains 
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> (AF0004, AF0005, IQ0012, and IQ0013) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (AF0001, IQ0042, and IQ0046), and four Gram-positive MRSA (AF0003, IQ0064, IQ0103, and IQ0211). All the bacterial isolates were obtained from San Antonio Military Medical Center under a Materials Transfer Agreement and demonstrated MDR according to the microbiology tests performed at the United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (

 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> tested, only strains of IQ0012, IQ0013, and IQ0042 were susceptible to imipenem; the rest of strains were resistant to all antibiotics tested. The five MRSA strains were resistant to amikacin, ampicillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, and erythromycin, but susceptible to gentamicin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline. In addition, luminescent strains of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (PA01) and MRSA USA300 were used in the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> study, allowing real-time monitoring of infection in the mouse burn wounds
