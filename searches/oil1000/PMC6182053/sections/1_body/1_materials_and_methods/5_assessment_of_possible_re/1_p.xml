<p class="p">To study any potential development of resistance to oregano oil, three representative strains (
 <italic class="italic">A. baumannii</italic> AF0005, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> IQ0042, and MRSA IQ0064) were propagated for 20 generations in the presence of sublethal doses of oregano oil as previously described (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, 200-μL aliquots of the bacterial suspensions (10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/ml) were inoculated into 96-well plates and exposed to the sub-MIC (2/3 MIC) of oregano oil at 37°C for 1 h, and the resultant bacteria were labeled as the first generation and tested for a MIC as above. The second generation was obtained by exposing the first generation to its sub-MIC for 1 h and determined for its MIC again. The procedure was repeated for up to 20 times. Oregano-resistance was determined by any significant increases in the MIC of successive generations.
