<p class="p">Extensive uses of broad spectrum antibiotics are the single most important factor in evolution of bacterial resistance (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hampton, 2013</xref>). A number of studies have shown that the most frequently identified MDR strains of bacteria in nosocomial infections and on the battlefield are Gram-negative bacteria

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Bacteria within biofilms can be as much as 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics and are responsible for recurrent antibiotic-resistant infections elsewhere in the body upon dissemination from the site of the biofilm (
