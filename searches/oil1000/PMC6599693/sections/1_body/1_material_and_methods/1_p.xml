<p class="p">In this study, NiTi (3M) and CuNiTi (ORMCO, 35°C, California) orthodontic wires were used. Both were a 017.025-inch. For electrochemical measurements, the following electrolytes were prepared: Ringer solution (LAPROPHAN) as base of artificial saliva with additions of 0.1%, 0.5% or 1% of Sodium Fluoride (NaF; Riedel-de-Haen) and 20 μl of extracts of different plants : Artemisia, Syzygium aromaticum (Clove) and Celtis australis. Extract of Celtis australis, essential oils of Artemisia, Clove and Celtis australis and hydrosols of Clove and Artemisia were studied. Diluted HCl solution was used to adjust the pH of all solutions to 4.4. The electrochemical experiments were performed with three electrodes in a beaker tube with a saturated calomel electrode used as a reference electrode and platinum as a counter. This assembly was connected to a Potensiostat (OrigaStat - OGS080). Corrosion resistance was studied using anodic potentiodynamic polarisation at a potential scanning of 20mV/min and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement at open-circuit potential, with a sinusoidal signal of 10-mV amplitude and frequencies in the range of 10kHz to 10mHz. The working electrodes were immersed in solutions for 30 minutes.</p>
