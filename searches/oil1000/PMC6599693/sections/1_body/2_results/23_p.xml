<p class="p">The analysis of microscopic photographs of NiTi and CuNiTi after immersion time shows that in low concentrations of NaF, we noted localised pitting and coloration all over the wires. By increasing the concentration of NaF (1% and above), we observe general and large pitting in all the surface of the wire.</p>
