<p class="p">Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>) shows capacitive arcs in all fluoride concentrations. The diagrams reveal that the polarization resistance (Rp) decreases with an increase in fluoride concentration. This justifies that the decrease in corrosion resistance of NiTi is related to higher fluoride concentrations.
