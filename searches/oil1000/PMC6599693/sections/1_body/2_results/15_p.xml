 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref> show the polarisation curves in different solutions and confirm that Clove and Artemisia hydrosols act like inhibitors of corrosion. These results are confirmed with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). The EIS graphic confirms lower impedance of the passivation film when fluoride is present in solutions.
