<p class="p">Corrosion potential (Ecorr) measured at the end of immersion period in all solutions is presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref"> Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref"> Table 2</xref>. Results showed that more negative Ecorr values are related to higher fluoride concentrations. The difference in Ecorr obtained in the lowest F- concentration (0.1%) and the highest F- concentration (1%) was -1102mV. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref> shows polarisation curves in different fluoride concentrations.
