<p class="p">To prevent corrosion, several methods are available. Among them, there is the surface coating, the cathodic protection and the use of anticorrosive solutions and anticorrosive inhibitors. Inhibitors remain the best way to protect the surface layer of metals. They decrease or inhibit the metallic reaction with its environment, when added at low concentrations to the medium. An inhibitor can act by adsorbing on the metal surface leading to a decrease of corrosion through an increase in the anodic and/or cathodic reaction, a decrease in the speed of scattering on the metal surface, or by decreasing its electric resistance (
