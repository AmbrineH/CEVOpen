<p class="p">A good understanding of the corrosion resistance behaviour of nickel-titanium based orthodontic wires is necessary to prevent ion release. Much research on the corrosive behaviour of nickel-titanium based orthodontic wires in fluoridated and acidulated medium have been conducted (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). However, none to our knowledge have investigated the effect of aromatic plants extracts, as alternative to sodium fluoride in toothpaste, on the corrosion properties of nickel-titanium-based orthodontic wires. It has been largely reported that fluoride helps remineralisation of enamel teeth protecting them from acid (
