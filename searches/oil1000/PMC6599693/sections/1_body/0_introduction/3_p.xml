<p class="p">Number of studies on the corrosion resistance of orthodontic wires have been conducted (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>-
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). Even though these wires develop a protective oxide layer on their surface, there is a metal ion release in oral cavity (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). Unfortunately, this results in toxic and allergic effects due, especially, to nickel release (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>).
