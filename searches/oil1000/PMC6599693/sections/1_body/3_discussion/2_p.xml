<p class="p">We observed that the corrosion behaviour of CuNiTi is different from that of NiTi. In low concentrations, we noticed that the Ecorr is high. By increasing the concentration of fluoride, the corrosion resistance of CuNiTi decreases and the passivation layer is broken. This could be explained by the irregularities present in the surface of as received CuNiTi (
