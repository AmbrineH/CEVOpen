<p class="p">Our results suggest that higher fluoride concentrations lead to a decrease of corrosion resistance of NiTi. Similar studies in the literature reported the same conclusions (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Previous investigations demonstrated that by increasing the concentration of fluoride, the passive layer is lost (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). This would indicate that fluoride is aggressive for NiTi alloys. This finding is confirmed by SEM analysis of the surface roughness of NiTi wires after immersion in fluoride solutions which suggested that in low concentrations, localised pitting are observed and in higher concentrations the corrosion become generalised as we noted in our study (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). Eliades in his review reported that NiTi may present crevices and pores that represent sites susceptible to corrosion (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>).
