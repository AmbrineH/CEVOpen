 <p> Plot of the amount of total carotenoids (ppm) for the investigated olive oil samples as obtained from the two spectroscopic methods: Values obtained with the method proposed by MÃ­nguez-Mosquera et al. [ 11] on the abscissa and by Domenici et al. [ 17] on the ordinate. A linear curve is shown, which correlates the two values, as described in the text. Each data point is displayed with an error bar corresponding to the confidence interval (CI). The R 2 value corresponding to the linear regression fit is also reported. </p>
