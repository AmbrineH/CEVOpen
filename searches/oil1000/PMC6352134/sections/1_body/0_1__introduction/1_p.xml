<p class="p">Virgin olive oil is obtained exclusively from the fruits of the olive tree, 
 <italic class="italic">Olea Europaea</italic> L., by mechanical extraction processes at controlled thermal conditions which do not lead to chemical and physical deterioration of the oil, thus preserving its characteristic and distinctive properties [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Virgin olive oil is an edible oil greatly appreciated, which is an essential component of the Mediterranean diet. Due to the high content of mono-unsaturated fatty acids, such as the oleic acid, and bioactive minor compounds, extra-virgin olive oil is considered beneficial for human health [

 <italic class="italic">Codex Alimentarius</italic>, and the European Commission, have established a commercial classification based on both chemical-physical and organoleptic properties of the final product. Virgin olive oils (VOOs) and extra-virgin olive oils (EVOOs) are those ones having the highest content of minor compounds with bioactive and nutritional properties (about 1%â€“2% of the total weight of olive oil) [
