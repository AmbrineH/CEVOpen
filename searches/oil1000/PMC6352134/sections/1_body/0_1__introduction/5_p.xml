<p class="p">Other methods based on the analysis of near UV-vis spectra of virgin and extra-virgin olive oils have been developed in the recent years, either in combination with multivariate chemometric approaches [

 <xref rid="B36-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. These methods provided are very useful for olive oil quality and authentication purposes, but their application requires a relatively complex data treatment and/or specific software. On the other hand, the need for fast, non-destructive, and validated analytical methods is justified by the raising competition in the field of olive oil and the consumer demand of high standards and high quality products.
