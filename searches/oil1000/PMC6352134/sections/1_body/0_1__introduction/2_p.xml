<p class="p">Pigments determine olive oil’s distinctive colour. Their relative chemical composition varies during olive oil’s life and it depends on many factors, such as the type of cultivar (genetic factor), the climatic and environmental conditions, the state of ripeness of the fruit at harvest, the storage and sampling of olives, the oil production process, and the storage conditions of the final product [

 <xref rid="B10-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], can be divided in two main classes: Carotenoids and chlorophyll derivatives [

 <xref rid="B13-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Olive oils contain a relatively rich variety of carotenoids (i.e., β-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, and other xanthophylls in minor percentages) and chlorophyll derivatives (i.e., chlorophylls A and B, pheophytins A and B, and other minor derivatives) [
