<p class="p">A recent new spectroscopic method, based on the quantitative analysis of the whole absorption spectrum of olive oil samples in the near UV-vis range from 390 nm to 720 nm, has been developed to determine the concentration of four main pigments: β-carotene and lutein among the carotenoids, and pheophytin A and pheophytin B among chlorophylls’ derivatives [

 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The advantage of this spectroscopic method is the very fast analysis and the absence of any sample treatment: Spectra are indeed acquired in bulk and they can be analysed by using a simple deconvolution procedure [

This spectroscopic approach has been recently tested on extra-virgin olive oil samples produced in several Mediterranean countries, from different cultivars, and it was validated by comparing it with the standard HPLC-DAD method [

Moreover, it was revealed to be useful in studying the effect of the different harvest years on the main pigments’ content of several extra-virgin olive oils produced from a blend of three cultivars (
