<p class="p">The present work focuses on the determination of the total amount of chlorophylls’ derivatives, the total amount of carotenoids, and the total amount of pigments in several virgin and extra-virgin olive oil samples, either mono-cultivar or a blend of different cultivars, produced in Tuscany (Italy), in different harvest years. Two relatively simple near UV-vis spectroscopic approaches have been used: The first method, proposed by Mínguez-Mosquera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], applied to olive oil samples diluted in cyclohexane, and the second method, proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], for the quantification of the four main pigments, applied to not fresh olive oils analysed in bulk. Results obtained by the two spectroscopic methods are then compared and discussed in view of their practical usefulness for a fast determination of pigments in virgin and extra-virgin olive oils.
