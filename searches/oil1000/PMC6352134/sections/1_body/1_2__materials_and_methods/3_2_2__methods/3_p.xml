 <xref rid="B19-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], allows us to determine the main pigments in olive oil by analysing the near UV-vis absorption spectra of olive oils recorded in the bulk, without any dilution or sample treatment. Only in few cases, before recording the spectra, the samples are centrifugated for 30 min at 5000 rpm, to minimize the light scattering phenomena due to eventual suspended particles and micro-emulsion scattering effect. This is particularly useful in the case of non filtered olive oils. Quartz cells with 0.5 cm optical path length are used. The experimental spectra are recorded and analysed by using a mathematical tool, compatible with Excel, developed by Domenici et al. [
