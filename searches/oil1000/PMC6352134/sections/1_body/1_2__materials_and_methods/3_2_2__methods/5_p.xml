<p class="p">As an example, the experimental spectrum of an EVOO sample (labelled T1) analysed in this work is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> (blue curve) together with the calculated spectrum (red curve) from the deconvolution method. The residuals can also be visualized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> as a black curve. The goodness of the mathematical treatment can be verified by the “R-square” test (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), which estimates the correlation between the experimental values and the values predicted by the deconvolution procedure. In the case of the spectrum reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> is 0.9978.
