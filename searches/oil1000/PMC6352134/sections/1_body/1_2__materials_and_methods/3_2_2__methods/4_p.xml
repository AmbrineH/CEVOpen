<p class="p">This mathematical approach consists in the deconvolution of the experimental spectrum in terms of four orthogonal functions obtained from the original experimental spectra of the four main pigments diluted in triolein [

 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The fitting procedure gives us the concentration of the four pigments and other relevant parameters, such as the ratio between the total amount of carotenoids and chlorophyll derivatives, the percentage of lutein with respect to the carotenoid fraction, and so on. The main approximation of this approach, as previously described [
