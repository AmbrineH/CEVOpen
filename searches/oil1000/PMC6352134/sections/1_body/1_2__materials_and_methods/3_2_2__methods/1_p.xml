<p class="p">The UV-vis absorption spectra of the olive oil samples were acquired by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Jasco V-550), at room temperature, by using quartz cells having an optical path of 1 cm (first method) or 0.5 cm (second method). Both experimental spectra of the olive oil samples in bulk and diluted in cyclohexane were collected in the range between 220 and 800 nm. All measurements were performed with three replicates.</p>
