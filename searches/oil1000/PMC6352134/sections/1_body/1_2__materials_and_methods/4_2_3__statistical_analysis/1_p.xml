<p class="p">The comparison between the two spectroscopic methods was performed concerning the concentrations of the total carotenoids and total chlorophylls’ derivatives as determined by the two approaches, by using the 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test model within the EXCEL program. All parameters were determined in triplicate. The data reported were subjected to analysis of variance and were expressed as mean ± confidence interval (CI) of three measurements. Significant differences between values of all parameters were determined at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05 according to the least significant difference (LSD) test.
