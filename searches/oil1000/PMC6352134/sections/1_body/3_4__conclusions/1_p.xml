<p class="p">In this paper, several virgin and extra-virgin olive oils from Italy, mainly from the Italian central region of Tuscany, were studied to determine their pigments’ content, quantified by means of two different methods of analysis based on near-ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. Extra-virgin olive oil samples produced from cultivars typical of Tuscany, such as Frantoio, Moraiolo, Leccino, and Pendolino, were investigated in terms of pigments’ content. The first approach proposed by Mínguez-Mosquera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] defines two indexes, K670 and K470, related to single absorbance values at wavelengths of 670 and 470 nm, respectively. To our best knowledge, this method has never been validated, but, since it is relatively fast and simple, it has been widely used to estimate the total concentration of chlorophylls’ derivatives and the total concentration of carotenoids in several works on the chemical-physical characterization of olive oils [

 <xref rid="B33-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The second approach, proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], is based on a mathematical deconvolution of the whole near UV-vis absorption spectrum of the oil, recorded in the bulk without any sample treatment, to obtain the concentrations of four main pigments present in olive oils: β-carotene, lutein, pheophytin A, and pheophytin B. This spectroscopic method has been validated in previous works [

The main outputs of the present study, can be here summarized: 1. The calculation of the two K670 and K470 indexes according to the equations proposed by Mínguez-Mosquera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] underestimates both the content of carotenoids and the content of chlorophylls’ derivatives, with respect to the deconvolution method proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]; 2. A good linear correlation between the values of concentration of chlorophylls’ derivatives obtained by means of the two methods was observed in a relatively large concentration range, which can be considered significant for virgin and extra-virgin olive oils; 3. In the case of the total amount of carotenoids, the linear correlation was worse, especially in the range between 1 and 3 ppm; 4. The statistical analysis of these data showed that the differences between the two methods were statistically significant; 5. The method proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] is recommended for the quantification of the total amount of carotenoids and the total amount of chlorophylls’ derivatives in the case of not fresh olive oils, with respect to the method proposed by Mínguez-Mosquera et al. [
