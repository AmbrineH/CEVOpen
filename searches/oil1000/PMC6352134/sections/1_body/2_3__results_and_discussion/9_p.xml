<p class="p">The comparison between the sum of pigments obtained from the first and second methods is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> and it demonstrates a relatively good linear correlation (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9376). However, as observed for the two pigments’ fractions, the method proposed by Mínguez-Mosquera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] provides values systematically underestimated by about 40%–60% with respect to the second method proposed by Domenici et al. [
