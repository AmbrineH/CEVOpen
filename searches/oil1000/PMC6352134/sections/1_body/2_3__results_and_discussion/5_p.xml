 <xref rid="foods-08-00018-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, it is evident there is large variability among samples, concerning both carotenoids’ and chlorophylls’ derivatives’ fractions. In particular, the olive oil samples richest in pigments (both carotenoids’ and chlorophylls’ derivatives) are the ones produced from the Moraiolo cultivar (sample T4) and blend samples mainly obtained from Moraiolo olives (samples T5-T7) and/or olive oil samples stored at low temperature (T = 4 °C) (samples T2, T5-T7). The samples, T6 and T7, have very high pigments’ content, reaching the total amount of 48.5 ppm (second method, 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00018-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) and 19.4 ppm (first method, 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00018-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). These samples have indeed both carotenoids’ and chlorophylls’ derivatives contents much larger than extra-virgin olive oil samples produced in the same geographic area, as reported in ref. [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. On the other hand, the olive oil samples with the lowest content of pigments are two blend samples, I1 (EVOO) and T9 (VOO), with a sum of pigments, determined with the second method, of 14.1 ppm and 7.7 ppm, respectively.
