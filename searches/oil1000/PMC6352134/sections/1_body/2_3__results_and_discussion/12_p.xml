<p class="p">The calculation of the total amount of carotenoids and the total amount of chlorophylls’ derivatives from the main pigments’ content obtained by the method proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] is more robust and reliable than the other spectroscopic method [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. It implies the deconvolution of the spectrum of olive oil, which can be done simply by implementing a standard fitting program (by using, for instance, the molar extinction original data provided in ref. [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] has the advantage of avoiding any sample treatment or oil dilution, which represents a limitation if the analytical method is required to be fast and easy to be used by non-specialised operators. A disadvantage of this method, however, is related to the main approximation, which consists in neglecting the effect of eventual minor pigments (for instance, some minor carotenoids absorbing in the 390–520 nm region) and the not applicability of the method to fresh olive oils [
