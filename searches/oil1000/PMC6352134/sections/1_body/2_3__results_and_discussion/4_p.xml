 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, it is evident the large variability of near UV-vis absorptions, due to different pigments’ content among the selected samples, which is an important issue for the purpose of the present work. The mathematical deconvolution of the absorption spectra recorded in the bulk and obtained by the fitting procedure proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] gave us the concentrations of the four main pigments: Lutein, β-carotene, pheophytin A, and pheophytin B. The total amount of carotenoids is calculated as the sum between the lutein and β-carotene concentrations; while the total amount of chlorophylls’ derivatives is calculated as the sum between the pheophytin A and pheophytin B concentrations. The obtained values of the total amount of chlorophylls’ derivatives, total amount of carotenoids, and the sum of pigments are reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00018-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The goodness of the fitting procedure (and of the method proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]) is expressed as the average value of R
