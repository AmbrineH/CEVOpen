<p class="p">In this work, olive oil samples were investigated in order to determine the main pigmentsâ€™ content. All samples, EVOO and VOO ones, were analysed in different times after being stored at controlled temperatures and in the dark. In general, all investigated samples are relatively old, thus excluding the presence of chlorophylls. Instead, all chlorophylls can be considered fully converted in pheophytins (coloured) or other derivatives (not coloured). Since the object of the present work is the comparison between two spectroscopic (relatively fast and simple) methods, the samples were purposely selected in order to have both mono-cultivar and blend samples. Moreover, for the same reason, olive oil samples obtained in different harvesting years were selected.</p>
