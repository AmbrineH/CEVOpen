<p class="p">First, the total content of chlorophylls’ derivatives and the total content of carotenoids were determined by applying the spectroscopic method proposed by Mínguez-Mosquera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], by using Equations (1) and (2), as described in the previous section. Different trials were performed to check the dilution effect (intra and inter-days tests), showing no significant changes. All measurements were performed in triplicate and the results are reported in
