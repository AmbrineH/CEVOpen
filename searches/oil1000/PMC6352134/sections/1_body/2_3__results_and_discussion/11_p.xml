<p class="p">From these results, the application of Equations (1) and (2), as proposed by Mínguez-Mosquera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], seems not to be correct in order to get reliable values of the concentrations of the total carotenoids’ and chlorophylls’ derivatives in olive oils. In particular, the underestimation of both carotenoids’ and chlorophylls’ derivatives could be explained by observing the spectral contribution of the four main pigments to the near UV-vis absorption of olive oils [

 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In the region between 390 and 560 nm, both carotenoids’ and chlorophylls’ derivatives contribute to the spectrum, while the region between 630 and 700 nm can be safely assigned to the sole chlorophylls’ derivatives contribution. In a previous work, proposed by Cayuela et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], the authors demonstrated that a more reliable determination of the total amount of carotenoids’ and chlorophylls’ derivatives, with respect to the simple calculation of the two K470 and K470 indexes, could be obtained by analysing a larger spectral region, from ultraviolet (UV) to near infra-red (NIR) wavelengths. However, their approach [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] implies the application of a more sophisticated multivariate model, as also proposed in other works, where the near UV-vis spectra are analysed to detect eventual adulterations of olive oils or to assess their authenticity and quality [
