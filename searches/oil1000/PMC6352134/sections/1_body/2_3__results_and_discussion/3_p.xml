<p class="p">All EVOO and VOO samples were analysed in the bulk by applying the second method (the one proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). Spectral measurements were performed for all samples the same day as the measurements described above by using the first method. For each sample, the amount of pigments is indeed supposed not to change within the same day. The near UV-vis absorption spectra recorded for all investigated samples in the bulk, in the range between 390 nm to 720 nm, as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-foods-08-00018" class="xref">Section 2.2</xref>, are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> (here, only one of the three replicates is shown, for each sample). All spectra were scaled in order to have zero absorption (Abs = 0) at wavelengths larger than 720 nm.
