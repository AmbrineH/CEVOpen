 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the comparison between the values of total carotenoids obtained from the first and second methods is reported. In this case, data are much more scattered, and the error (indicated as confidence interval) associated to both methods is larger than for chlorophylls’ derivatives. As reported in a previous study, where the mathematical approach proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] was analytically validated with respect to a standard HPLC-DAD protocol [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], the quantification of lutein is less straightforward due to the eventual presence of minor carotenoids having the same absorption spectrum than that of lutein, while β-carotene is quantified with very high precision [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This could be one reason for the worse correlation.
