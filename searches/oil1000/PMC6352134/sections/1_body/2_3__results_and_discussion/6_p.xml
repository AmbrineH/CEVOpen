 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) obtained from the first and second methods demonstrate a good correlation, as shown by the linear regression (R

 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] gives values underestimated by about 40%–60% with respect to the second method proposed by Domenici et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00018-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, this behaviour can be generalized for the range of concentrations from about 5 ppm to about 32 ppm, which is a relatively high range considering the typical values of concentrations of chlorophylls’ derivatives in virgin and extra-virgin olive oils.
