<p class="p">On the other hand, the quantification of the carotenoids’ fraction from the first method, from the sole absorbance value at 470 nm, seems not to be appropriate, since the contribution of the chlorophylls’ derivatives (in this case, mainly pheophytins A and B) to the spectral absorption at this wavelength is significant, as clearly demonstrated in refs.
