<p id="Par30" class="p">Evaluation of EOs for their synergistically adulticidal effects with permethrin was performed by using the topical toxicity assay procedure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], as described earlier. Acetone or ethanol was used as the solvent for preparing the required concentrations of permethrin as well as binary mixtures of EO and permethrin (EO-permethrin: permethrin mixed with an LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> concentration of EO). Groups of the test substances, permethrin and EO-permethrin, were evaluated against both MCM-S and PMD-R strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. Four doses of permethrin were applied to each of 25 female mosquitoes for testing their adulticidal efficacy, and each treatment was replicated four times. Four to six doses of EO-permethrin were applied to each of the 25 female mosquitoes for identifying synergist EO candidates, and each application was replicated four times. The PBO-permethrin treatment (permethrin mixed with an LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub> concentration of PBO) also was included as the positive control. The dosages used in these bioassays were expressed in ng of the test sample per mg of body weight of a live female. Four experimental assessments against each mosquito strain were accomplished from separately reared batches, and the mortality data were pooled and analyzed by Probit to determine 24 h lethal dosages.
