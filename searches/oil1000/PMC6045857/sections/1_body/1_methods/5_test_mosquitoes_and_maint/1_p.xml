 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, including Muang Chiang Mai-susceptible (MCM-S) and Pang Mai Dang-resistant (PMD-R) strains. The MCM-S strain was initiated from local specimens collected at Muang Chiang Mai District, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, and had been maintained consecutively since 1995 in the insectary of the Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, CMU [

The PMD-R strain, which proved to be resistant to permethrin, was established from the field mosquitoes collected originally at Ban Pang Mai Dang, Mae Tang District, Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, and had been maintained in the same institute since 1997 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. The PMD-R strain was reared under selection pressure for maintaining the resistance level by regular exposure to 0.75% permethrin, using WHO test kits with some modifications [

 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> was colonized separately in a laboratory free of exposure to pathogens at 25 ± 2 °C and 80 ± 10% RH under a 14:10 h light/dark photoperiod cycle. Approximately 200 larvae were reared in plastic trays (33 cm long × 28 cm wide × 9 cm high) containing tap water at densities in the range of 150–200 larvae/tray, and fed on sterilized ground dog-biscuits twice daily. Adults were reared in humidified cages and given continuous access to 10% aqueous sucrose and 10% multivitamin syrup solution. Female mosquitoes were blood-fed periodically for egg production. Two- to five-day-old non-blood-fed females were available continuously for experimental adulticidal bioassays.
