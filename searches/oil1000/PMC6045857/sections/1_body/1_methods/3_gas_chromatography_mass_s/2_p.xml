<p id="Par26" class="p">The column was a DB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness). The total GC-MS running time was 20 min. The analytical conditions were injector and transfer line temperatures of 250 and 280 °C, respectively; the oven temperature was programmed to increase from 50 to 250 °C at 10 °C/min; the carrier gas was helium at 1.0 ml/min; the injection was of 0.2 μl (1/10% v/v, in CH

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>); and the split ratio was at 100:1. An electron ionization system with an ionization energy of 70 eV was used for the GC-MS detection. The data were acquired over a range of 50–550 atomic mass units (amu) with a scan rate of 2.91 scans/s. The relative percentages of the constituents were expressed as percentage by peak area normalization. Identification of the components in the EOs was based on their retention indices (RI). The RI was calculated by the equation of Van den Dool &amp; Kratz [
