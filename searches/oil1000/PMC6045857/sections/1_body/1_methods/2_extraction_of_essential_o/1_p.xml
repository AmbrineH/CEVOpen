<p id="Par24" class="p">The plant specimens were shade-dried separately for 3–5 days in an open area, with active ventilation and ambient temperature of about 30 ± 5 °C, in order to remove the moisture content prior to extracting the natural essential oils (EOs). A total of 250 g of each dried plant material was pulverized mechanically to a coarse powder and used to isolate essential oil (EO) by steam distillation. The distillation apparatus consisted of an electric heating mantle, a 3000 ml round-bottomed flask, an extraction column, a condenser and a cool ace (Eyela Cool Ace CA-1112 CE, Tokyo Rikakikai Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The flask was filled with 1600 ml of distilled water and 10–15 glass beads, which was then heated by an electric heating mantle to about 100 °C for at least 3 h until completion of distillation, after which no more EO could be obtained. The EO layer was separated from the water phase using a separatory funnel, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na
