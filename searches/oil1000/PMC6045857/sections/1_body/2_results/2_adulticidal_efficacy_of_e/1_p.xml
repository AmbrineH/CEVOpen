<p id="Par36" class="p">The results of three EOs evaluated for adulticidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. It was found that all of the EOs exhibited lethal effects, varying in type and dosage against MCM-S 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. The most effective EO was 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic>, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic>, with LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 3.30, 7.97 and 10.05 μg/mg MCM-S female, respectively, which were insignificantly higher than those of 3.22 (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 1, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -0.775, 
 <italic class="italic">P =</italic> 0.667), 7.94 (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 2, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 1) and 9.57 (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -1.549, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.333) μg/mg PMD-R female, respectively. This corresponded relatively to PBO, which offered slightly higher adulticidal effects on PMD-R rather than MCM-S strains, with LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 4.79 and 6.30 μg/mg female, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.021, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.057). It can be estimated that the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and PBO against PMD-R were approximately 0.98-, 0.99-, 0.95- and 0.76-fold lower than those against MCM-S, respectively. Therefore, this indicated the relative similarity in PBO and EO susceptibility between the two strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> although PMD-R was insignificantly more susceptible than MCM-S. In contrast, susceptibility to permethrin was vastly different between these two strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). PMD-R displayed significant resistance to permethrin as expected when compared to MCM-S (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value = 0.44 ng/mg female), with a higher LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 3.70 ng/mg female (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.309, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029). Although PMD-R was far less susceptible to permethrin than MCM-S, its susceptibility to PBO as well as 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> oils was slightly higher than that in MCM-S.
