<p id="Par37" class="p">Binary mixtures of permethrin and EO (LD
 <sub class="sub">25</sub>) exhibited either synergism (SR value &gt; 1.05) or no effect (SR value = 1 Â± 0.05), as observed in adulticidal bioassays of EO-permethrin combinations. The combined adulticidal effects of EO-permethrin mixtures on the experimental 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> of both MCM-S and PMD-R strains are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The addition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> oil was found to decrease the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of permethrin slightly against MCM-S, and increase it slightly against PMD-R from 0.44 to 0.42 ng/mg female and 3.70 to 3.85 ng/mg female, respectively. By contrast, adding oils of 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> vastly diminished the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of permethrin against MCM-S from 0.44 to 0.07 (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.309, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029) and to 0.11 (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.309, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029) ng/mg female, respectively. The SR values of EO-permethrin mixtures, determined from the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values against MCM-S were 6.28 and 4.00 with 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> oils added, respectively. Correspondingly, the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of permethrin declined greatly against PMD-R when 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> oils were added, from 3.70 to 0.42 (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.309, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029) and to 0.003 (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.337, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029) ng/mg female, respectively. The SR value of permethrin coupled with 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> against PMD-R was 8.81, whereas those of 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic>-permethrin mixture was 1,233.33. Permethrin toxicity was also increased by the positive control, PBO, through decreasing of its LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values from 0.44 to 0.26 ng/mg female and 3.70 to 0.65 ng/mg female against MCM-S (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.309, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029) and PMD-R (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> = 0, 
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic> = -2.309, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.029), respectively. The SR values of PBO-permethrin mixtures were 1.69 and 5.69 against MCM-S and PMD-R strains, respectively. These findings suggest that the oils of 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic>, as well as PBO, synergized permethrin toxicity more than 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> oil on both MCM-S and PMD-R strains.
