<p id="Par35" class="p">The steam distillations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> rhizomes as well as 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> barks provided pale yellow liquid oils, with yields of 0.15, 0.27 and 0.54% (v/w) on dry weight basis, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). GC-MS studies on the chemical constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> oils revealed the presence of 19, 17 and 21 compounds, constituting 80.22, 86.75 and 97.24% of all the compositions, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Compounds in the rhizome oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> comprised mostly cyperene (14.04%), followed by calamenene (9.57%), α-copaene (7.97%) and α-cubebene (7.53%). The chief chemical constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> rhizome oil was 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene (18.27%), followed by α-bergamotene (16.28%), 1,8-cineole (10.17%) and chavicol (10.09%). While cinnamaldehyde (64.66%) was identified as the major component of 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> bark oil, cinnamyl acetate (6.61%), α-copaene (5.83%) and 3-phenylpropanal (4.09%) were seen as the minor constituents. Chemical structures of cyperene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene and cinnamaldehyde, which were the main compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic>, respectively, are displayed in Fig.
