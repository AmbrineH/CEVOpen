 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated the possibility of using plant-based products, particularly essential oils (EOs) as adulticides for controlling important mosquito vectors. Adulticidal properties against certain important mosquito species have been identified in many plant oils such as

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. EOs are currently not only applied individually but also used in mixtures with extracted botanicals or existing synthetic insecticides, generating varied degrees of toxicity. A combination of conventional insecticides in the class of organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids with EOs/plant extracts acts synergistically or antagonistically in toxic efficacy and has been documented as effective against disease vectors and pests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. However, most studies on the synergistically toxic effects of combinations involving phytochemicals, with and without synthetic chemicals, have been conducted in agricultural insect vectors and pests rather than mosquitoes of medical importance. Furthermore, much work on the synergistic activity of botanical-synthetic insecticide combinations against mosquito vectors has focused on larvicidal action.
