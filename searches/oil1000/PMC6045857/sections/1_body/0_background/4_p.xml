<p id="Par22" class="p">In a previous study by the authors, as part of an ongoing research project for screening adulticides from local edible plants in Thailand, EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Cyperus rotundus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alpinia galanga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum verum</italic> were found to possess potential adulticidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. This study was, therefore, designed to evaluate the adulticidal efficacy of EOs isolated from these medicinal plants against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, both pyrethroid resistant and susceptible strains. The synergistic effect of binary mixtures of EOs and synthetic pyrethroids, with promising adulticidal relevance, was also assayed with the aim of reducing the use of conventional insecticides and improving the management of resistant mosquito vectors, specifically 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. In this paper, the chemical profiles of effective EOs and their potential for enhancing the toxicity of synthetic permethrin were reported against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> in both pyrethroid susceptible (MCM-S) and resistant (PMD-R) strains.
