<p id="Par19" class="p">The mosquito, 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> L. (Diptera: Culicidae), is a dominant vector capable of transmitting dengue fever and other infectious viral diseases such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika, which pose a great and continued threat to mankind [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Dengue virus is the most serious pathogenic hemorrhagic fever infecting humans, with an estimated 50–100 million cases each year and over 2.5 billion people at risk worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. The outbreaks of this communicable disease inflict a huge burden on populations, health systems and economies in most tropical countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. According to Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health, 142,925 dengue cases and 141 deaths were reported throughout the country in 2015, which is more than triple the number of cases and deaths in 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Although there is documented history of dengue fever being eliminated or significantly reduced through 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], the infection rates have in fact risen drastically, with an explosive growth of illness worldwide, partly due to decades of global warming. The elimination and control of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> is relatively difficult because it is a domestic mosquito vector that mates, feeds, rests and lays eggs during daylight in and around human habitations. Furthermore, this mosquito has the ability to adapt to environmental changes or disturbances resulting from either natural phenomena, such as droughts, or human control measures, and it can bounce back to its initial population size [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Since dengue vaccine has only been registered recently and no specific dengue therapeutics are available, preventing and reducing the risk of dengue transmission depends entirely on controlling mosquito vectors and interrupting human-vector contact.
