<p id="Par38" class="p">Permethrin is an insecticide in broad-spectrum pyrethroid insecticides, which are a large class of structurally very diverse, synthetic analogues of natural pyrethrins discovered from flowers of pyrethrums (
 <italic class="italic">Chrysanthemum</italic> spp.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Synthetic pyrethroids are used worldwide to control virtually all arthropods of agricultural and medical importance. However, the need to reduce the use of conventional synthetics and develop alternatives is now urgent due to the deleterious effect of applying synthetic insecticides, particularly regarding developing and widespread mosquito resistance as well as the impact on long-term health and the environment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. In addition to protecting the environment and human health, the benefits of botanical insecticides are, for example, high selectivity, worldwide availability, and convenient production and application, which make them more attractive candidates for use in mosquito control management [

In this study, apart from GC-MS analysis for illustrating the chemical profiles of effective EOs, evaluation of the adulticidal activity of EOs and their potential for increasing the toxicity of synthetic permethrin were undertaken against
