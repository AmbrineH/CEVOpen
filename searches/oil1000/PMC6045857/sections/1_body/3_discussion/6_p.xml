<p id="Par43" class="p">Despite vigorous efforts to understand how efficacy enhancement can be brought about, the synergy mechanism is still not clearly understood. Possible reasons for distinct efficacy and synergistic potential could be the differences in the chemical compositions of the test product and mosquito susceptibility associated with the status and development of resistance. There was a difference in the constituents of the EOs tested in this study between the major and the minor compositions, in which some compounds have proved to exhibit repellent and toxic effects on various pests and disease vectors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>]. However, none of the main compounds characterized from 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> oils, such as cyperene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene and cinnamaldehyde, respectively, have been tested herein for adulticidal and synergistic activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. Therefore, future investigations would be needed to isolate the active constituents present in each of the essential oils and elucidate their insecticidal efficiency and synergistic interactions against this mosquito vector. In general, insecticide activity depends on actions and counteractions between a toxicant and insect tissues, which are simplified into three stages: penetration of the insect integument as well as the membranes of the target organs, activation (= target site interaction) and detoxification of the toxicant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. Therefore, the insecticide synergy that leads to enhancement of the potency of a toxicant combination needs at least one of these categories, for example, increased penetration, greater activation of the accumulated compound, or less detoxification of the active insecticidal constituent. Vigor tolerance, for example, delayed the cuticular penetration with a thickened cuticle layer and biochemical resistance, such as the enhanced metabolism of insecticides which was observed in some resistant strains of insects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. The significant efficacy in potentiating permethrin toxicity of EO, particularly on PMD-R, is probably indicative of the addressing of insecticide resistance problems by interacting with resistance mechanisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Tong &amp; Bloomquist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>] supported the results of this study by showing synergistic interactions between EOs and synthetic pesticides against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, with evidence of inhibitory activity in detoxifying enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and carboxylesterases, which are related prominently to the development of resistance to conventional pesticides. It is claimed that PBO also enhances good insecticide penetration, except as a metabolic inhibitor of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, as supported by its use as the positive control in synergist studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. Interestingly, 1,8-cineole, which is one of essential constituents identified in 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> oil, was noted for its toxic effect on insect species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>] and has been reported for its combinations with synergistic bioactivity in several areas of research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>]. Furthermore, the penetration-enhancing effect of 1,8-cineole was recorded when combined with various pharmaceutical drugs, including curcumin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>], 5-fluorouracil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>], mefenamic acid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>] and zidovudine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>], either 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>. The probable role of 1,8-cineole in synergistic insecticidal activity is, therefore, not only as an active principle but also as a penetration enhancer. With greater synergism with permethrin, particularly on PMD-R, the synergistic effects of 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> oils observed in this study are possibly a consequence of interactions with the resistance mechanism, that is, enhancing of permethrin penetration, increasing of activation of the accumulated compound, and inhibition of detoxifying enzymes such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and carboxylesterases. However, these aspects need further investigation in order to elucidate the specific role of EOs and their isolated compounds, both individually and in combinations, in the synergistic mechanism.
