<p id="Par42" class="p">The synergistic effects of the combinations between synthetic insecticides and botanical extracts against various species of mosquitoes have been reported in several previous studies. Larvicidal bioassays against 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</italic> studied by Kalayanasundaram and Das [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>] revealed significant synergism between fenthion, a broad-spectrum organophosphate, and extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Leucus aspara</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Turnera ulmifolia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Vinca rosea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clerodendron inerme</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pedalium murax</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Parthenium hysterophorus</italic>, with synergistic factors (SFs) of 1.31, 1.38, 1.40, 1.48, 1.61 and 2.23, respectively. In the larvicidal screening of 15 mangrove plant species, petroleum ether extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora apiculata</italic> stilt root was found to be most effective, with an LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 25.7 mg/l against 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. The synergism between this extract and pyrethrum, a botanical insecticide, was also recorded as reducing the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of pyrethrum against 
 <italic class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae from 0.132 to 0.107 mg/l; also, the SF calculation of 1.23 followed the formula shown in this study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The combined larvicidal action of 
 <italic class="italic">Solanum xanthocarpum</italic> root extract and certain synthetic insecticides, namely fenthion, cypermethrin (a synthetic pyrethroid) and temephos (an organophosphate larvicide), were evaluated against 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. The combined application of cypermethrin and 
 <italic class="italic">S. xanthocarpum</italic> petroleum ether extract showed its synergistic action toward cypermethrin at all ratios. The most effective ratio was a binary 1:1 combination, showing an LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value and SF of 0.0054 ppm and 6.83, respectively, against 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. While a 1:1 binary mixture of 
 <italic class="italic">S. xanthocarpum</italic> and temephos acted antagonistically (SF = 0.6406), the 
 <italic class="italic">S. xanthocarpum</italic>-fenthion combination (1:1) was observed to exhibit synergistic activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</italic>, with an SF of 1.3125 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Tong &amp; Bloomquist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>] studied the effect of plant EOs on the toxicity of carbaryl, a wide-spectrum carbamate, and permethrin against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. It was revealed that EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Amyris balsamifera</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Piper nigrum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus virginiana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Helichrysum italicum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Santalum album</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Sesamum indicum</italic> increased the toxicity of carbaryl against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae, with SR values ranging from 1.0 to 7.0. Conversely, none of the EOs were toxic to adult 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and no synergistic effects were recorded in the EO-carbaryl combinations against this stage. PBO was used as the positive control that potentiated the toxicity of carbaryl against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae and adults, with SR values of 4.9â€“9.5 and 2.3, respectively. Binary mixtures of permethrin and EO or PBO were investigated in only larvicidal activity. While the EO-permethrin mixtures acted antagonistically, the PBO-permethrin mixtures recorded synergistic interaction against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae. However, the dose-response experiments and the SR estimation of the PBO-permethrin mixtures had not been performed. Although little work has been achieved on the synergistic, adulticidal activity of botanical-synthetic combinations against mosquito vectors, these findings lend support to the present results, which have opened up the prospects for synergist addition that not only decreases dose application but also increases insecticidal potency. Furthermore, the findings of this study demonstrate, for the first time, the significantly superior efficacy of synergizing permethrin toxicity with 
 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> oils over PBO against both pyrethroid susceptible and resistant strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. However, an unexpected finding from the synergism assay revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> oil, which afforded the greatest adulticidal activity against both strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, surprisingly provided an unsatisfactory effect with permethrin toxicity. Variability in the toxic actions and synergistic phenomena may be partly because of the influence of the variety of types and levels of bioactive principles in these oils.
