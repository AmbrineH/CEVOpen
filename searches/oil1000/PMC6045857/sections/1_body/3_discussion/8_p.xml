<p id="Par45" class="p">The significant synergism of the selected EOs in enhancing adulticidal toxicity against PMD-R 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, particularly 
 <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> oil with the extraordinary SR value of 1233.33, presents EOs as having a promising role as synergists for improving permethrin efficacy. This could encourage the use of a new active natural product whose joint action may prolong the use of highly effective mosquito control agents. It also sheds light on the possibility of EOs as alternative synergists for efficacious improvement of earlier or conventional insecticides in order to combat the existing problem of resistance in mosquito populations. Employment of readily available plants in mosquito control programs not only decreases dependence on imported and expensive materials, but also stimulates local efforts to enhance the public health system.
