<p id="Par44" class="p">An increasingly high level of permethrin resistance in the main vector populations of Thailand was detected in 1977, and the use of permethrin was then largely substituted in later decades by use of other pyrethroid chemicals, particularly deltamethrin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>]. However, vector resistance to deltamethrin and other classes of insecticides is now extremely widespread throughout the country due to excessive and continuous use [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>]. In order to resolve this issue, rotation or reuse of discarded insecticides that were effective previously and are less toxic to mammals, such as permethrin, has been recommended. Currently, permethrin resistance can still be detected in mosquito populations although its use has declined gradually in recent national public mosquito control programs. This may be due to mosquitoes being exposed to commercial household pest control products, mostly consisting of permethrin and other pyrethroids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Therefore, successful achievement regarding reuse of permethrin requires strategies to reduce vector resistance and increase implementation. Although none of the EOs tested individually in this study were as effective as permethrin, it was observed that their combined effect with permethrin can produce impressive synergistic results. This is a promising indication that interactions of EOs with resistance mechanisms, resulting in combinations of permethrin with EO, are more effective than the application of insecticides or EOs alone, specifically in PMD-R 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. The benefits of synergistic mixtures in increasing potency, despite the use of lower dosages applied in vector control, could possibly lead to improved resistance management and reduced costs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. It is encouraging to note from these findings that EOs of

 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> have significantly greater efficacy in synergizing permethrin toxicity than PBO in both MCM-S and PMD-R strains, and are potential substitutes for conventional synergists.
