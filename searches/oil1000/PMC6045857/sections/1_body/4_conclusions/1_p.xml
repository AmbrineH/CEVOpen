<p id="Par46" class="p">These research findings have clearly thrown light on the significant synergizing actions that result from combining EOs and permethrin. The results emphasize the potential of EOs for use in mosquito control as a botanical synergist for improving permethrin efficacy against mosquitoes, particularly in resistant populations. Future studies on synergism bioassays of

 <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> oils and their isolated compounds, combined with insecticides of either natural or synthetic origin against a variety of mosquito species and stages, and toxicity testing in non-target organisms are required for development and practical exploitation of EOs as viable alternative synergists.
