  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">In a previous screening program for mosquitocides from local edible plants in Thailand, essential oils (EOs) of 
   <italic class="italic">Cyperus rotundus</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">Alpinia galanga</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum verum</italic>, were found to possess promising adulticidal activity against 
   <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>. With the aim of reducing usage of conventional insecticides and improving the management of resistant mosquito populations, this study was designed to determine the potential synergism in the adulticidal efficacy of EOs on permethrin toxicity against 
   <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, both pyrethroid-resistant and -susceptible strains
   <italic class="italic">.</italic>

  <p id="Par2" class="p">EOs extracted from rhizomes of 
   <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> as well as 
   <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> barks were evaluated for chemical compositions and adulticidal activity against Muang Chiang Mai-susceptible (MCM-S) and Pang Mai Dang-resistant (PMD-R) strains of 
   <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. Adulticidal bioassays of EO-permethrin mixtures for synergistic activity were also performed on these 
   <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> strains.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">Chemical characterization by the GC-MS analytical technique demonstrated that 48 compounds were identified from the EOs of 
   <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic>, representing 80.22%, 86.75% and 97.24%, respectively, of all compositions. Cyperene (14.04%), 
   <italic class="italic">β</italic>-bisabolene (18.27%) and cinnamaldehyde (64.66%) were the main constituents of 
   <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> oils, respectively. In adulticidal bioassays, EOs of 
   <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">C. verum</italic> were effective in killing 
   <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, both MCM-S and PMD-R strains, with LD
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 10.05 and 9.57 μg/mg female, 7.97 and 7.94 μg/mg female, and 3.30 and 3.22 μg/mg female, respectively. The adulticidal efficacy against MCM-S and PMD-R 
   <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> of these EOs was close to that of piperonyl butoxide (PBO, LD
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> values = 6.30 and 4.79 μg/mg female, respectively) but less pronounced than that of permethrin (LD
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> values = 0.44 and 3.70 ng/mg female, respectively). Nevertheless, combination-based bioassays discovered the accomplished synergism of EOs together with permethrin. Significant synergistic effects with permethrin against both the strains of 
   <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> were recorded in the EOs of 
   <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic>. Addition of 
   <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> oils decreased the LD
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of permethrin against MCM-S dramatically from 0.44 to 0.07 and 0.11 ng/mg female, respectively, with synergism ratio (SR) values of 6.28 and 4.00, respectively. Furthermore, EOs of 
   <italic class="italic">C. rotundus</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">A. galanga</italic> also reduced the LD
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of permethrin against PMD-R drastically from 3.70 to 0.42 and 0.003 ng/mg female, respectively, with SR values of 8.81 and 1233.33, respectively.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">The synergy of enhanced adulticidal toxicity recorded from EO-permethrin combinations against both strains of 
   <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> presents a promising role of EOs as a synergist for improving mosquitocidal efficacy, particularly in situations where conventional compounds are ineffective or inappropriate.
