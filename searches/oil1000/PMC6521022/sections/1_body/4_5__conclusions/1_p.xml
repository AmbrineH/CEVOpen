<p class="p">Feedlot diet reduced ALA concentration by 50% in muscle compared with the Lucerne diet; whereas, Ryegrass and RyeFeedlot diets had 15% and 40% lower ALA concentration than Lucerne fed lambs, respectively. Muscle LA concentration was increased by 40%â€“45% in Feedlot animals compared to other treatments. Antioxidant enzymes activity of GPX1 and SOD2 in the muscle LL were significantly increased by the Lucerne diet compared with other dietary treatments. Gene expression of enzymes coding for 
 <italic class="italic">gpx1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">sod2</italic> in the muscle was greater for Lucerne fed lambs compared with Feedlot fed lambs. Muscle GPX1 and SOD2 enzyme activities were significantly linearly related to ALA. A positive linear relationship was observed between mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">gpx1</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">sod2</italic> and ALA concentration. We believe that the diet-induced increase in muscle ALA upstream the activities of GPX1 and SOD2, which in turn upregulate the expressions of GPX1 and SOD2 antioxidant enzymes in muscle tissues. This diet-induced change in activities and gene expressions of antioxidant enzymes may have beneficial effects on the performance, health and wellbeing of animals and humans, nevertheless, further research is warranted.
