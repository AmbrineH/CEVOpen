<p class="p">We report for the first time that diet-induced increases in muscle ALA concentration upregulate the activity and gene expression of GPX1 and SOD2 antioxidant enzymes, believed to be through altered cellular biochemical actions and signal transduction pathways (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00723-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The upregulation was shown by a positive relationship between antioxidant enzyme gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">gpx1</italic> and ALA or 
 <italic class="italic">sod2</italic> and ALA (i.e., a lower delta CT is associated with upregulation of a gene), and a positive relationship between antioxidant enzyme activity of GPX1 and ALA or SOD2 and ALA in muscle LL tissue. We also observed that ALA deposition in muscle LL was influenced by the diet that animals were being fed. We have previously shown that these essential omega-3 fatty acids were stored in the muscle membranes as phospholipid bilayer [

 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. We state that this may have potential benefits to performance and health and wellbeing of animals and humans as antioxidant enzymes can alleviate the impact of oxidative stress, impaired immune function and metabolic disorders associated with nutritional deficiencies, extreme heat/cold or other stress-induced events such as metabolic syndrome.
