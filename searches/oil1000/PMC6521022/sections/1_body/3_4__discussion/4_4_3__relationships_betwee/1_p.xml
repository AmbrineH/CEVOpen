<p class="p">There are no reports examining the relationships between the dietary enhancement of muscle ALA and activity of antioxidant enzymes of GPX and SOD or between the dietary enhancement of muscle ALA and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes of GPX and SOD. The current study showed that the GPX1 and SOD2 antioxidant enzyme activities linearly increased with the increase in ALA concentration in LL muscle of sheep, regardless of dietary treatments. At the same time, the significant increase in ALA concentration also linearly increased the mRNA expression in muscle LL, as observed by a reduction in delta CT. This diet-induced change in antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expressions may have beneficial effects on the performance and health and wellbeing of animals and humans.</p>
