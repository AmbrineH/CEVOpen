<p class="p">It is well known that humans and animals cannot synthesise essential parent (precursor) fatty acids of LA and ALA 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> and therefore these fatty acids must come from the diet. These parent fatty acids are the source for the formation of their products of long-chain n-3 fatty acids of eicosapentaenoic (EPA, C20:5), docosapentaenoic (DPA, C22:5) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, C22:6) as well as n-6 fatty acid of arachidonic (AA, C20:4) acids, through desaturation and elongation processes, known to offer many health benefits and important for the growth and development of individuals [

It was interesting to note that Feedlot feeding reduced ALA concentration by 50% in muscle compared with Lucerne whereas Ryegrass and RyeFeedlot groups had 15% and 40% lower than Lucerne. This, in turn, resulted in 25% reduction in all long-chain n-3 fatty acids of EPA+DPA+DHA in Feedlot animals when compared with those fed Lucerne, although the other two feeding strategies delivered the same amounts as Lucerne fed animals. Linoleic acid concentration was increased by 40%â€“45% in Feedlot animals compared to other treatments. These findings indicate that dietary treatments clearly affected LA and ALA concentrations in muscle tissue and when Feedlot was combined with Ryegrass (RyeFeedlot) there was a partial reduction in ALA and complete reduction in LA due to the competition between the parent n-3 and n-6 fatty acids for elongation and desaturation process [

It was also noted that although significant, the products of long-chain n-3 (EPA, DPA, DHA) and n-6 (AA) were small in magnitude compared to their parent ALA and LA indicating that the efficiency of conversion was low as reported by many others [

A previous study conducted by our group showed that flax meal at 10% or algae at 2% of diets fed to sheep significantly increased ALA or DHA, respectively [

As there were no significant dietary effects in the major saturated fatty acids of C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0 as well as major monounsaturated fatty acids of C14:1, C16:1 and C18:1, these results will not be discussed. The non-significant differences cannot be explained easily but the shorter feeding length (6 weeks) used in this study may in part be a contributing factor.
