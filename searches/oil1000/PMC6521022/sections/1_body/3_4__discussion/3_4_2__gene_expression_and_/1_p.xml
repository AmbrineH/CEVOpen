<p class="p">The expression and activity of enzymes can be regulated by vitamins, minerals and fatty acids from diets and the hormone levels circulating within biological systems. To the best of our knowledge, no information is available on dietary intervention influencing muscle PUFA concentration and resultant altered activity and gene expression of GPX1 and SOD2 antioxidant enzymes in muscle tissues of sheep or humans. There have been several studies conducted in humans, rats, chicken and cattle investigating the effect of dietary PUFA on mRNA abundance of lipogenic enzymes of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT-1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), delta-6 (∆-6) desaturase, delta-5 (∆-5) desaturase, fatty acid synthase in relation to fat metabolism (deposition, energy expenditure, oxidation), obesity, insulin resistance and other autoimmune responses [

 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] that dietary manipulation of fatty acid composition in ruminants is mediated, at least partially, through the regulation of lipogenic enzymes expression; and that the regulation is tissue specific as observed in longissimus muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue of bulls. It was found that the mRNA abundance of
