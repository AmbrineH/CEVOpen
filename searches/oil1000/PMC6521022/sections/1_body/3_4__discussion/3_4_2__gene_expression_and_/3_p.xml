<p class="p">Two recent studies examined the activity and mRNA expressions of SOD and GPX antioxidant enzymes in mammary tissues in dairy cows with flax meal feeding at 5%â€“15% level or flax hull feeding at 10% or 500 g flax oil per day infused in the abomasum [

 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Those studies found that flax meal affected neither antioxidant enzyme activity nor mRNA expressions of SOD and GPX enzymes, but cows fed flax hulls, a rich source of lignans (secoislariciresinol diglucoside), had higher levels of 
 <italic class="italic">gpx1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">sod1</italic> mRNA expression and lower mRNA expressions of 
 <italic class="italic">gpx3</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">sod2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">sod3</italic> compared with cows fed nil flax hull diet. However, no effect of flax hull or oil on the activity of antioxidant enzymes was observed. Even though the fatty acid compositions of mammary tissues were not determined in both studies, it was [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] concluded that supplementing dairy cow diets with flax products high in omega-3 PUFA and lignans can modulate the activities of SOD and catalase enzymes that are responsible for the removal of free radicals leading to oxidative stress. Further, they [

 <italic class="italic">sod1</italic> mRNA abundance in the mammary tissue was related to the scavenging activities of polyphenolic compounds present in mammalian lignans that were converted from plant lignans of flax hulls added to the diet. Previous studies conducted in mice [

 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] showed that feeding fish oil rich in n-3 fatty acids of EPA and DHA enhanced GPX and SOD enzyme activities in spleen and liver tissues, respectively.
