<p class="p">Data were analysed using ANOVA procedure in GenStat 17th edition (VSN International, Hertfordshire HP2 4TP, UK) [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] with treatment used as the main effect and paddock as the block structure in order to obtain the predicted means for muscle individual fatty acid composition, mRNA expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes. 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-tests were used to determine the overall significant difference among the predicted means, whereas the difference between two predicted means was judged to be significant if it was at least two times the average standard error of difference (SED). Relationships of muscle LL glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), superoxide dismutase (SOD2) enzyme activities, mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">gpx1</italic> (∆CT) and 
 <italic class="italic">sod2</italic> (∆CT) with individual n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were analysed using a REML mixed model in GenStat 17th edition. In these REML analyses, the 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> effect of paddocks within a treatment was included as a random effect to account for any variability due to paddocks within a treatment. Plots of residuals versus fitted values were examined to check for any extreme outliers and to judge the necessity of data transformation to satisfy the assumption of normality with constant variance.
