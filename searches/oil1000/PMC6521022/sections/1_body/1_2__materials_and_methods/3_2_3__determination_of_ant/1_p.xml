<p class="p">The frozen samples allocated were ground and antioxidant enzymes activity was determined enzymatically according to the methods reported by others [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The activity of the GPX enzyme was determined at 340 nm using a commercial assay kit (Cayman chemical, Redfern, NSW, Australia) in which oxidation of NADPH was monitored spectrophotometrically, whereas reductase activity was determined using H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as a substrate. The activity of SOD enzyme was determined using a commercial assay kit (Cayman chemical, Redfern, NSW, Australia) by measuring the production of superoxide radicals at 440 nm, where one unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. Total protein concentration in muscle LL tissue was determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Sigma Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). The activity of GPX was expressed as nmol/min/mg protein in muscle tissue whereas SOD was expressed as U/mg protein in muscle tissue.
