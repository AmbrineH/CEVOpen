 <italic class="italic">ucp2</italic>). The custom forward and reverse primers for the gene of interest were designed using Invitrogen’s OligoPerfect Designer on the basis of ovine nucleotide sequences obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database and synthesized by GeneWorks (Thebarton, SA, Australia). Primer sets for the genes are shown in
