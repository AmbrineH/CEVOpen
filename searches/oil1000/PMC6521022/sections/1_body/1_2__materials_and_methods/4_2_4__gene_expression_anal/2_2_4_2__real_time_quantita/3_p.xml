<p class="p">The thermocycling conditions carried out for each assay run for all genes were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 52 °C to 60 °C for 45 s (annealing temperature optimised depending on primers) and 72 °C for 1 min. Optical detection was performed at 72 °C. After amplification, a melt curve (95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and then 40 cycles of 55 °C for 10 s) was included in the protocol to validate primer specificity and amplification of a single PCR product.</p>
