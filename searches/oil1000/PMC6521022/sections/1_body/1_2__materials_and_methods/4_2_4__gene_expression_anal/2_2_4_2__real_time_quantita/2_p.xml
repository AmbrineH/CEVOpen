<p class="p">The PCR quantification was performed in 25-μL reactions (including 1 to 3 μL of forward and reverses primer, depending on optimized concentration, and 2 μL of sample cDNA) prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using SYBR GreenER Supermix (Life Technologies Pty Ltd., Mulgrave, Vic, Australia), and SYBR green fluorescence was quantified in triplicate with the iQ5 Single Colour Real Time PCR Detection System (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Gladesville, NSW, Australia). Each assay plate contained nontemplate control and a positive control (pooled cDNA), and a standard curve (five serial dilutions of a pooled cDNA sample) was run for each gene to determine the amplification efficiency of the respective primer pair.</p>
