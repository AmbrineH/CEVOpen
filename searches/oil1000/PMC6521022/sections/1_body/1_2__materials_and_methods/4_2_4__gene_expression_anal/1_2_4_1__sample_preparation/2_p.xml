<p class="p">The quality and quantity of the RNA extracted were evaluated by the Experion System Automated Electrophoresis Station (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Gladesville, NSW, Australia) with the Experion StdSens Analysis Kit (Bio- Rad Laboratories Inc., Gladesville, NSW, Australia). For determination of RNA concentration and the ratio of 28S to 18S, the electropherograms were analysed for each sample. All the samples had an RNA quality indicator (RQI) higher than 9.0. Total RNA (8 μL) was then reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System Reagents (Invitrogen Life Technologies Pty Ltd., Mulgrave, Vic, Australia, #18080051) for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Random hexamers were used as the primer during cDNA synthesis.</p>
