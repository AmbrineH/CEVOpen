<p class="p">Muscle LL samples were subjected to extraction and evaluation of gene expression. Isolation of total RNA from muscle was performed using Trizol Isolation Reagent (Life Technologies Australia Pty Ltd., Mulgrave, Australia) and PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion, Life Technologies Australia Pty Ltd., Mulgrave, Australia) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The extracted RNA was then diluted with 50 µL of RNase free water and stored at −80 ℃ until analysis performed.</p>
