 <italic class="italic">longissimus lumborum</italic> (LL) sample was collected from the same muscle location in the body and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at −80 °C for the analyses of mRNA expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes. At 24 h post-mortem, carcass weights, carcass fatness and the ultimate pH of the muscle LL was recorded as a standard commercial routine procedure. Muscle LL from the hindquarter over the lumbar region was removed from the left side of the carcass and duplicate samples (~25 g) were collected and stored at −20 °C for the determination of fatty acids. One set of samples from all animals was freeze-dried, homogenised and approximately 0.5 g was used for fatty acid extraction using a modified procedure as reported earlier [
