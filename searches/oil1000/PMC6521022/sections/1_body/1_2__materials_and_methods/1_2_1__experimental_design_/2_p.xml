<p class="p">Second cross lambs born to Poll Dorset sires and Border Leicester Merino dams were used in the experiment. The lambs were born in July 2012 and raised on annual ryegrass (
 <italic class="italic">Lolium rigidum</italic> L.) pasture with their dams until weaning at ~10-week-old age. Eighty-four male wether (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 42) and female ewe (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 42) lambs were used in this experiment. After weaning, the lambs were separated from their dams and allocated to their four finishing diets in separate paddocks. Lambs were blocked on liveweight and then within each block of four lambs randomly allocated to treatments. The four finishing diets were: standard commercial feedlot pellets (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 24, Feedlot); lucerne (
 <italic class="italic">Medicago sativa</italic> L.) pasture (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 24, Lucerne); annual ryegrass with sub clover (
 <italic class="italic">Trifolium subterraneum</italic> L.) pasture (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 18, Ryegrass) or annual ryegrass pasture plus feedlot pellets (500 g/day/head) (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 18, RyeFeedlot). There were four replicates of Feedlot and Lucerne paddocks each having six animals per replicate and three replicates of Ryegrass and RyeFeedlot paddocks each having six animals per replicate for a total of 84 lambs.
