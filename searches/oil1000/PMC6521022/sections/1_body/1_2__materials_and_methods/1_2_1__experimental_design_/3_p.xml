<p class="p">The feeding of lambs, pasture allocation and animal performance have been reported in detail elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In brief, lambs were adapted to their experimental diets for 2 weeks (0–2 week) and then fed their full treatment diets for the following six weeks (2–8 week). The Ryegrass and RyeFeedlot treatments replicates were implemented in the same pasture area thus allowing the lambs to graze annual ryegrass sward of similar nutritive characteristics within the forage component of the two diets. Lambs fed their Lucerne, Ryegrass and RyeFeedlot diets were moved to new paddocks (new pasture allocation) every week whereas the Feedlot groups were maintained at their particular locations throughout the feeding. Liveweight of animals were recorded weekly. All lambs had acceptable body weight gains ranging from 200–300 g/day, which can be categorised as moderate to high growth under standard lamb production systems. The nutritional composition of diets has been previously presented [

 <xref rid="nutrients-11-00723-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The Ryegrass treatment had a low crude protein (CP) concentration compared to other treatments. This was a result of the annual ryegrass having already entered its reproductive phase resulting in a decline in CP concentration. This has resulted in different performance and carcass weights between dietary treatments and this has been reported in a previous [
