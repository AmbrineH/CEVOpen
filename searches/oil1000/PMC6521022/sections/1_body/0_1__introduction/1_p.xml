<p class="p">Dietary fat concentration and composition are two of the major factors influencing basal energy metabolism, body fat deposition and muscle fatty acid composition [

 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For example, humans and animals consuming diets high in grains and oilseeds/meals such as corn, sunflower, peanut often deposit high concentrations of n-6 fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid (LA), the precursor n-6 fatty acid and their derivatives in body tissues [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Conversely, animals and humans consuming greater amounts of green plant materials and feeds from marine origin deposit greater concentrations of n-3, mainly alpha linolenic acid (ALA), the precursor n-3 fatty acid and their derivatives [

 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. These effects were not only due to diets being rich in n-3 and n-6 precursor fatty acids but also due to competition between these fatty acids for absorption at the enterocyte and peripheral tissue level, as they share common enzymes for desaturation and elongation processes [

 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Dietary intervention studies performed in human and laboratory animals with supplementation of n-3 fatty acids revealed beneficial outcomes on brain development, vision improvement as well as health and wellbeing aspects [

This has heightened the interest in health-enhancing food products, which has led to producers and retailers focusing on farm animal products such as meat and milk with increased concentrations of health-promoting nutrients such as essential fatty acids, minerals and antioxidants [
