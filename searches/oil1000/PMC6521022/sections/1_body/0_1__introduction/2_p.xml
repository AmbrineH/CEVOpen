<p class="p">It is also important to maintain the antioxidant status of tissue systems through dietary intervention to avoid the oxidation of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 and n-6) in muscles and subsequently ensure no off-flavour development of food prior to consumption [

 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. This latter strategy is only necessary if the antioxidant status of the muscle and other tissues are deficient i.e., below the threshold at the time of animal exsanguination in order, to avoid or slow down the oxidation process in muscle foods post-mortem [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00723" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Oxidative stress in living organisms results from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant defence, which can cause lipid, protein and DNA damage in cells and tissues, resulting in the development of certain diseases and pathophysiological changes [

To protect the cells and tissues from oxidative damage, living organisms maintain a multi-dynamic antioxidant defence system. This system contains non-enzymatic antioxidants (such as vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenols, flavonoids and proteins containing thiol groups,) and enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase [

The general belief is that these enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants present in the organelle (circulatory and tissue) systems have the capacity to break down free radical formations by directly scavenging the free radical forming agents such as H
