 <p class="p">This study investigated the effect of dietary manipulations on muscle fatty acid composition, the activities and relative mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzymes and the relationship between muscle enzyme activity or mRNA expression and alpha linolenic acid (ALA) concentration in sheep. Eighty-four lambs blocked on liveweight were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments, lucerne pasture (Lucerne), annual ryegrass pasture (Ryegrass), feedlot pellets (Feedlot) or annual ryegrass plus feedlot pellets (RyeFeedlot). After six weeks of feeding, lambs were slaughtered and within 30 min post-mortem, samples collected from the 
  <italic class="italic">longissimus lumborum</italic> (LL) muscle for RNA isolation and measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities. At 24 h post-mortem, LL samples were collected for determination of fatty acid concentrations. Feedlot treatment decreased ALA, eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) concentrations compared with other treatments and increased linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) compared with Lucerne and Ryegrass (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The activity of Glutathione peroxidase (GPX1, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD2, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) enzymes in the muscle increased with Lucerne compared to other treatments. Lucerne increased muscle 
  <italic class="italic">gpx1</italic> mRNA expression by 1.74-fold (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.01) and 1.68-fold (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05) compared with Feedlot and other diets, respectively. The GPX1 (
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.319, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002) and SOD2 (
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.244, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.009) enzyme activities were positively related to ALA. There was a positive linear relationship between muscle 
  <italic class="italic">gpx1</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.102, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.017) or 
  <italic class="italic">sod2</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.049, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.09) mRNA expressions and ALA concentration. This study demonstrates that diet can affect concentrations of ALA and other fatty acids as well as change activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in muscle. Increased antioxidant activity may, in turn, have beneficial effects on the performance, health and wellbeing of animals and humans.
