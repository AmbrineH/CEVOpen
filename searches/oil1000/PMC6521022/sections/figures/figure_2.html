 <p> Relationship between muscle glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) ( A) or superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) ( B) enzyme activity and alpha linolenic acid (ALA) concentration. Muscle GPX1 ( r 2 = 0.319, p = 0.002; Figure 2A) and SOD2 ( r 2 = 0.244, p = 0.009; Figure 2B) enzyme activities were linearly related to ALA (C18:3n-3). In Figure 2A,B, F.lot = Feedlot and Rye+Pellet = RyeFeedlot. Relationship between muscle gpx1 ( C) or sod2 ( D) mRNA expression (Delta CT) and ALA. A positive ( r 2 = 0.102, p = 0.017, Figure 2C) linear relationship of mRNA expressions of gpx1 with ALA was observed whereas the mRNA expressions of sod2 tended ( r 2 = 0.049, p = 0.09, Figure 2D) to be related to ALA concentration. In Figure 2C,D, Rye+Pellet = RyeFeedlot. In Figure 2Aâ€“D, each point represents an individual animal. </p>
