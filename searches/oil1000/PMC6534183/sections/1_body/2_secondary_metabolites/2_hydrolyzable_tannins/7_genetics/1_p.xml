<p class="p">To allow functional assessment of hydrolyzable tannin metabolic and regulatory genes 
 <italic class="italic">in planta</italic>, a pomegranate hairy root culture system was established that produces a substantial amount of hydrolyzable tannins and is easily transformable (Ono et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The hairy root culture system has been successfully utilized for genetic characterization of candidate hydrolyzable tannin biosynthetic genes in pomegranate, such as 
 <italic class="italic">PgUGT84A23</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PgUGT84A24</italic> involved in Î²-glucogallin production (Ono et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Together with the recently published reference genomes (Qin et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Yuan et al., 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), pomegranate hairy roots hold great potential for functional genomics in the hydrolyzable tannin pathway.
