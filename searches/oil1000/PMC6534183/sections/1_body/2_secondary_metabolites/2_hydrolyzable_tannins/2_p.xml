<p class="p">In pomegranate fruit peels, punicalagin α and β isomers (designated punicalagins) are the predominant form of hydrolyzable tannins accounting for over 85% of total tannins (Seeram et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Other major hydrolyzable tannins in fruit peels include punicalin, ellagic acid, gallagic acid, and ellagic acid glycosides. In most cases, hydrolyzable tannins are present in both fruit peel and aril juice (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). There are only a few reports on hydrolyzable tannins in pomegranate seeds; interestingly, 3,3′-di-

 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-methylellagic acid have been identified in seeds, but not in fruit peels or aril juice (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). It is worth noting that metabolite identification depends on the pomegranate accessions that are being analyzed. For example, a castalagin derivative and a galloyl-bis-HHDP-hexoside (casuarinin) derivative were only detectable in fruit peels of “Acide,” but not in the other three Tunisian pomegranate accessions (“Gabsi,” “Nebli,” and “Tounsi”) (Abid et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Conversely, punicalagins, galloyl-HHDP-hexoside, galloyl-HHDP-DHHDP-hexoside (granatin B), and digalloyl-HHDP-hexoside (pedunculagin II) were present in fruit peels of all four accessions, and most abundant in “Acide” (Abid et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
