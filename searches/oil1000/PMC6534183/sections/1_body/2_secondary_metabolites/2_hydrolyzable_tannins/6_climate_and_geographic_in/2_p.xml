<p class="p">The quality of aril juice under deficit (i.e., reduced) irrigation was investigated in Spain (Mena et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Three water regimes were applied to pomegranate trees at 75% evapotranspiration (ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub>, non-stressed control), 43% ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> (moderate water stress), and 12% ET
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> (severe water stress). Water stress drastically decreased punicalagins, causing 30 and 70% reduction in moderate and sever stresses, respectively, in aril juices of fruits harvested from the corresponding trees (Mena et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This study provided valuable information on the implications of water stress on the hydrolyzable tannin metabolism and the nutritional value of aril juice.
