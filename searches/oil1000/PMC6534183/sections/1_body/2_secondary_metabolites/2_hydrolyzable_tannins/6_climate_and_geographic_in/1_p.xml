<p class="p">To understand the impact of growth environment on hydrolyzable tannin profiles, fruit peel and aril juice hydrolyzable tannins were compared for 11 accessions grown in the Mediterranean or desert climate in Israel (Schwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Mediterranean climate promoted high levels of hydrolyzable tannins in aril juice in most of the accessions evaluated; in contrast, desert climate had a positive impact on hydrolyzable tannins in fruit peels (Schwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). It was reported that the sweet/sour phenotype and environment interactions had the most influence (54.4%) on total tannin variations in aril juice of 10 commercial cultivars grown in four different regions in China, followed by the growth environment (45.6%). There were negative correlations of overall average temperature with total polyphenol, total tannin, and punicalagin concentrations. The sweet/sour phenotype only accounted for 0.06% of the variations in tannins among different cultivars (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
