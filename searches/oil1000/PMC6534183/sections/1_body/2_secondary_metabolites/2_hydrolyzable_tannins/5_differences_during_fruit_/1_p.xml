<p class="p">Several studies have compared hydrolyzable tannin profiles in developing pomegranate fruits. However, the fruit developmental stages were defined by different standards, such as days after fruit set/full bloom, physico-chemical properties, or physiological attributes of the fruit (Fawole and Opara, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013b</xref>). Developing fruits of two cultivars, “Wonderful” and “Rosh Hapered,” grown in Israel were collected during a span of 8 or 10 weeks (Shwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Three major hydrolyzable tannins, gallagic acid, punicalin isomers (designated punicalins), and punicalagins, were quantified in water extracts of the developing fruits. All three hydrolyzable tannins showed decreased accumulation in developing fruit peels in both cultivars (Shwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Fruits of “Ruby” grown in South Africa were harvested at five stages according to days after full bloom (Fawole and Opara, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013a</xref>). Total hydrolyzable tannins in aril juice declined during the progression of fruit maturation, and were accompanied by decreases in ellagic acid and gallic acid (Fawole and Opara, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013a</xref>).
