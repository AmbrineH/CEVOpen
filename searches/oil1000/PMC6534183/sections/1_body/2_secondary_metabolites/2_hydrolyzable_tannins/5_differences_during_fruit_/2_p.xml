<p class="p">Relative amounts of hydrolyzable tannins in fruit peel, aril juice, and seed of developing pomegranate fruits were also investigated. Fruits of the Chinese cultivar “Taishanhong” were harvested at 10-day intervals for nine collections. Unicalagins, ellagic acid, and gallic acid were higher in fruit peel than aril juice and in seed; all three metabolites showed decreased accumulation in the three tissues during fruit development (Han et al.,

When quantified by absorption of the methanolic extracts at 550 nm, total hydrolyzable tannins gradually decreased in fruit peels at low, low-medium, medium, and medium-high (corresponding too early to late fruit development) stages of the Spanish cultivar “Mollar de Elche.” In contrast, they were not detectable in aril juice at all stages. In seeds total hydrolizable tannins increased at medium and then decreased at medium-high stages (Fernandes et al.,
