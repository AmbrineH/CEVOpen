<p class="p">In comparison with fruit peels and aril juices, hydrolyzable tannins are less abundant in seeds. Total tannins, including gallotannins, ellagic acid derivatives, and gallagyl tannins (mainly punicalagins and punicalins) were 4,792–6,894 mg/L in fruit peels of six cultivars grown in the southern United States, which were 50- to 60-fold and over 100-fold higher than those in aril juices and seeds, respectively (Pande and Akoh, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Punicalagins, punicalins, gallic acid, and ellagic acid were quantified in fruit peels, aril juices, and seeds of five widely consumed pomegranate cultivars in China (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Punicalagins were found in fruit peels in the range of 61.75–125.23 mg/g dry weight. In all of the cultivars analyzed, fruit peels contained more punicalagins and punicalins than aril juices did, while these hydrolyzable tannins were not detected in seeds (Li et al.,
