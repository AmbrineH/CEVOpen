<p class="p">Pomegranates have traditionally been consumed for fresh aril juice; therefore, several studies focused on quantification of hydrolyzable tannins in this tissue. Aril juices of 12 commercial pomegranate varieties and 5 non-commercial varieties grown and harvested in different regions (Israel, Turkey, Spain, Iran, Tunisia, and Italy) contained 139.7–473.4 mg/L of ellagic acid and 300–810 mg/L of total phenolic acids and hydrolyzable tannins (Gómez-Caravaca et al.,

Interestingly, total tannins, ranging from 15 to 32 mg/100 g, showed an inverse correlation with ellagic acid concentrations in these cultivars (Mousavinejad et al.,
