<p class="p">In recent years, industrial procedures have been established that press juice from whole pomegranate fruits. Therefore, the commercial pomegranate juices contain hydrolyzable tannins from aril juice as well as other parts of the fruit. For example, the commercial juices of “Wonderful” contained 1,500–1,900 mg/L of punicalagins, about 100-fold higher than those present in aril juice (Gil et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Similarly, punicalagins were in the range of 31–607 mg/L in aril juices, and 156–1,169 mg/L in whole fruit juices of 10 Iranian pomegranate cultivars (Akhavan et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, the levels of punicalagins in the aril juices of some cultivars were particularly high, e.g., the punicalagin level in the aril juice of “JPGRT” (607 mg/L) was significantly higher than those in whole fruit juices of cultivars “PSY” (156 mg/L), “VKT” (286 mg/L), “MY” (338 mg/L), “SRAB” (549 mg/L), and “TML” (569 mg/L) (Akhavan et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
