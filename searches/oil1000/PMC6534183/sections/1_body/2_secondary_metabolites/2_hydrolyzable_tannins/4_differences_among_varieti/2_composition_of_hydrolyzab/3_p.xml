<p class="p">Four major hydrolyzable tannins, including punicalagins, punicalins, gallagic acid, and ellagic acid, were quantified from whole fruits and aril juices of 29 local and domesticated Israeli accessions (Tzulker et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). In addition to variations in the relative abundance of the four hydrolyzable tannins (puncalagins on the scale of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> mg/L, punicalins 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> mg/L, gallic acid 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> mg/L, and ellagic acid 10
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> mg/L in whole fruit extracts), the accessions analyzed were largely different in the concentrations of each hydrolyzable tannin in whole fruits and aril juices. Furthermore, the hydrolyzable tannins were a thousand fold less concentrated in aril juices than in whole fruits (Tzulker et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>).
