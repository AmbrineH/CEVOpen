<p class="p">Although hydrolyzable tannin composition and content cannot be directly compared among different studies due to the different extraction and quantification methods they employed, it can be concluded that hydrolyzable tannins vary in different pomegranate accessions grown in the same region, suggesting genetic contributions to hydrolyzable tannins. On the other hand, variations in hydrolyzable tannins were also observed for the same cultivar, such as “Wonderful,” when grown in multiple locations in the world. This phenomenon can be due to the many landraces of “Wonderful” and additionally suggests that climate and cultivation have an effect on hydrolyzable tannins.</p>
