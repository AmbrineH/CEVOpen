<p class="p">Anthocyanins are the key color molecules of pomegranate present in various parts of the pomegranate trees, including leaves, flowers, and fruits. The pomegranate fruit is a rich source of anthocyanins and produces several derivatives of anthocyanins. These secondary metabolites accumulate in all fruit tissues and mainly in the edible part of the fruit, the arils, and in the fruit peel (Gil et al.,

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; Tzulker et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Six anthocyanin molecules were identified in pomegranate fruit, including mono- and di-glucosides of cyanidin (red pigments), delphinidin (purple pigments), and pelargonidin (orange pigments) (Du et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1975</xref>; Gil et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995b</xref>). All six anthocyanin pigments were detected in pomegranate cultivars from different geographical regions, which include Israeli, Turkish, Spanish, Californian, Tunisian, Italian, and Chinese pomegranates (Gil et al.,

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>; Ben-Simhon et al.,

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, differences in the relative amounts of anthocyanins were found, depending on variety, climatic, and cultural variables (Gil et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995a</xref>; Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Borochov-Neori et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Some unusual anthocyanin molecules were reported by Fischer et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>), who detected cyanidin pentoside in pomegranate peel and juice and cyanidin rutinoside and cyanidin pentoside-hexoside in the juice. Zhao et al. (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported that peonidin hexoside and myricetin hexoside were detected in the peel of a dark red Chinese cultivar. These findings suggest that the pigment profile of pomegranates may be much more diverse.
