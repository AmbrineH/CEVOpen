A 100% increase in the anthocyanin concentration was observed between 20 and 80 days after fruit set. The highest concentration (138 mg/100 g) was recorded after 100 days, followed by a slight significant decrease (9.3%) up to 140 days of fruit development (Kulkarni and Aradhya, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Shwartz et al. (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) investigated changes in total anthocyanin content in the arils of two Israeli varieties during fruit maturation. The anthocyanin levels in the aril juice increased significantly during maturation in “Wonderful,” which had red aril color (from 165 to 328 mg/L), but not in “Rosh Hapered,” which had light pink aril color. Hernandez et al. (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>) studied changes in the quantity and quality of anthocyanins in the juice of five Spanish pomegranate varieties during ripening. Juice from the fruit 26–34 weeks after flower set (immature fruits to commercially mature fruits) was extracted and analyzed. Generally, there was an increase in juice pigmentation during fruit ripening, but total anthocyanin during fruit maturation differed among varieties. Three varieties did not show any change in the first 4 weeks of fruit development and then, the anthocyanin concentration increased rapidly until ripening. The two other varieties already showed an increase in anthocyanin content at very early stages. In the early fruit development stages, delphinidin di-glucoside was the main pigment, followed by cyanidin di-glucoside, while in the later stages, the mono-glucoside derivatives of cyanidin and delphinidin increased considerably. The pelargonidin derivatives were always present in small amounts. The authors found that fruits located in the north side of the trees showed an earlier increase in anthocyanin pigmentation, which was explained by lower temperatures during the night in this niche (Hernandez et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). The pattern of di-glucosides in the first stages of fruit development and mono-glucosides anthocyanin prevailing in the latter stage was also shown in another study done by Gil et al. (
