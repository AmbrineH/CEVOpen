<p class="p">The differences found in the composition and quantity of anthocyanin between the peel and the arils suggest that anthocyanin accumulation in these tissues reflects differential genetic control of anthocyanin production. This assumption is further supported by the different dynamics of anthocyanin accumulation in the peel and arils during fruit development (Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Holland and Bar-Ya'akov, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This tissue- specific differential accumulation of anthocyanins is one of the main difficulties in determining the ripening time of pomegranate fruit by external phenotypic parameters.
