<p class="p">Zhao et al. (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) studied three Chinese cultivars of pomegranates with fruit peel colors ranging from green to dark red. The fruit skin was analyzed for anthocyanin content and composition during fruit development at 10-day intervals until full ripening. They found that cultivars' peel color and fruit developmental stage significantly influenced the profile of the anthocyanins and their content. The pigment content generally increased toward ripening and the relative amounts of the six primary anthocyanin molecules changed (Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Shwartz et al. (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) also studied the changes in anthocyanin content in the peel of two pomegranate cultivars. Peel color significantly changed during maturation in both varieties. Total anthocyanin was significantly correlated with color index in both accessions, indicating that the total anthocyanin content contributed significantly to the peel's skin color (Schwartz et al.,
