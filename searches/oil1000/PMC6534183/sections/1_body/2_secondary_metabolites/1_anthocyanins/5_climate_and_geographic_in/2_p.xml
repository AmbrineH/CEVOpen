<p class="p">Anthocyanin content in the arils and peel of pomegranate fruit is also sensitive to salt stress (Borochov-Neori et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). When two different pomegranate cultivars were irrigated with saline water it was found that increased salinity had a positive influence on anthocyanin accumulation in the pomegranate fruit peel (Borochov-Neori et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The increase in anthocyanin accumulation corroborates the proposed function of anthocyanins in plant response to environmental stress conditions (Chalker-Scott, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; Hatier and Gould, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Steyn, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The magnitude of the effect of increased salinity concentrations from 1 to 6 dS
 <sup class="sup">m−1</sup> was about 4-fold (from 20 to 80 mg/Kg) of anthocyanin for the highly colorful “Wonderful,” and about 8-fold (from 5 to 40 mg/Kg) for the pale color “SP-2.” These findings differ from those obtained for the anthocyanin in the arils (Borochov-Neori et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), where salinity had an adverse effect on anthocyanin accumulation, especially in “Wonderful.” As for exposure to different temperatures, exposure to salinity affected the level of anthocyanin derivatives. At elevated salinity levels, “Wonderful” fruit peel accumulated purple delphinidins in addition to the major pigment types, cyanidins and pelargonidins, whereas in “SP-2” the proportion of the orange color pelargonidins increased.
