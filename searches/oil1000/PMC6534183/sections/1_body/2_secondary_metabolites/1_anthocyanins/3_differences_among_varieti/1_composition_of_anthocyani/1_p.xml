<p class="p">In an attempt to determine the color variability among pomegranate varieties, 29 varieties that represent most of the phenotypic variability in the Israeli pomegranate collection were assayed. Total anthocyanin levels were measured for both peel and aril extracts. The content of total anthocyanins in the peel varied between 0.2 and 8.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> mg/L, while the anthocyanin content in the aril juice varied between 0.2 and 3.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> mg/L (Tzulker et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The high variation that was detected in peel total anthocyanin content is also observed by the naked eye. Thus, fruit from various varieties in the Israeli collection display colors which range from purple to dark red to green (Tzulker et al.,

Significant differences were found in anthocyanin concentration among different cultivars in their fruit peel (up to 344 mg/100 g) and in their juice (up to 364 mg/100 g) (Zhu et al.,
