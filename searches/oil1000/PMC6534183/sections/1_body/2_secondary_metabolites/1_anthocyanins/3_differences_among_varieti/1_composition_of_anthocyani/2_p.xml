<p class="p">No correlation was observed between the content of anthocyanin in the peel and in the arils. The predominant color of the fruit peel is mostly the outcome of accumulation of cyanidin derivatives. Cyanidine derivatives constitute about 85% of the anthocynins in ripened pomegranate fruit, while pelargonidin derivatives constitute about 15% in ripened fruit (Ben-Simhon et al.,

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995b</xref>; Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, in some dark red Chinese cultivars, large amounts of cyanidin mono-glycoside and delphinidin mono-glycoside (over 100 mg/100 g) were found in the skin (Zhao et al.,
