<p class="p">While most Israeli and Mediterranean cultivars displayed negligible levels of delphinidines in their skins, delphinidins, and cyanidins were the major anthocyanins in their aril juice (Gil et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995b</xref>; Seeram et al., 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006a</xref>; Borochov-Neori et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In Israeli cultivars delphinidine derivative content could reach about 40% of the total anthocyanin content of the aril juice and cyanidines could reach about 60% of the total anthocyanins in the aril juice. Similar data was also reported for “Mollar” in Spain, where delphinidine derivatives constituted about 50% and cyanidine constituted about 45% of the aril juice anthocynins (Gil et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995b</xref>). Juices from fruits of 30 varieties grown in Tunisia were studied for their anthocyanin content. The total anthocyanin content was different among varieties and ranged from 9 to 115 mg/L juice (Hasnaoui et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Aligourchi et al. (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) measured the amounts of total anthocyanins in the juice of 15 pomegranate varieties obtained from Yazd province in Iran. There was significant difference in total anthocyanin levels among varieties ranging from 15.0 to 252.2 mg/L juice.
