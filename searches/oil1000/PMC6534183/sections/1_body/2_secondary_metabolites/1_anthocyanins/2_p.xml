<p class="p">The function of anthocyanin in the biology of the pomegranate tree is not yet fully understood. The tree of the “white” phenotype pomegranate varieties, which do not produce any anthocyanin (Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), is vigorous and fertile. It seems, however, that the white flowers and anthocyanin-less fruits are more susceptible to browning and radiation damages (personal communication). The accumulation of anthocyanin in young pomegranate leaves also suggests that it acts to protect the tissues from abiotic and biotic stresses during leaf development.
