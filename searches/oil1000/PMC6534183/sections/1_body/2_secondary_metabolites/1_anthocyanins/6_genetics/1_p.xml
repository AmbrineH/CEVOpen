<p class="p">The high variability in color of the skin and arils of pomegranate suggest a strong genetic control of anthocyanin production in pomegranate. Several expressed genes that are highly correlated with anthocyanin accumulation during fruit development were first identified by Ben-Simhon et al. (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). These genes were initially isolated on the basis of their homology to known genes involved in the production of flavonoids and anthocyanins. They included the structural genes: 
 <italic class="italic">PgLDOX</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">ANS</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">PgDFR</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">PgCHS</italic> and the regulatory genes: 
 <italic class="italic">PgTTG1</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">WD40</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">PgAN1</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">BHLH</italic>), and 
 <italic class="italic">PgAn2</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Myb</italic>). Up until now the only genes from pomegranate for which a confirmed function in anthocyanin production was reported are the genes which encode for the enzyme leucoanthocyanidin oxidase 
 <italic class="italic">PgLDOX</italic> (Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and for the 
 <italic class="italic">WD40</italic> type of transcription factor 
 <italic class="italic">PgTTG1</italic> (Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The function of the pomegranate gene 
 <italic class="italic">PgTTG1</italic> was shown by complementing the TTG1 mutant of arabidopsis with the pomegranate 
 <italic class="italic">PgTTG1</italic> homolog (Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In this case, the 
 <italic class="italic">pgTTG1</italic> function was demonstrated for both the ability to regulate anthocyanin production and for regulating trichome formation. The function of 
 <italic class="italic">PgLDOX</italic> was confirmed by identifying the site of the recessive mutation within its coding sequence located between positions 90â€“91 downstream of the ATG initiation codon. The mutation disrupts the gene in the anthocyanin-less pomegranate mutant. This mutation abolishes the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">LDOX</italic> in all the pomegranate tissues and prevents the accumulation of anthocyanin (Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The clear linkage of the mutation to the inability to produce anthocyanins was accomplished by genetic mapping, using segregating F2 populations for a white phenotype mutant that does not produce anthocyanins in its fruit and leaf tissues (Ben-Simhon et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The identification of 
 <italic class="italic">PgLDOX</italic> as the gene responsible for the anthocyanin-less pomegranate phenotype was supported by Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), who showed that the anthocyanin-less mutant does not express the 
 <italic class="italic">PgLDOX</italic> gene. These authors cloned several additional candidate genes from white and red pomegranate cultivars related to anthocyanin synthesis and studied their expression (Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The recent determination of the pomegranate genome and expression analysis of candidate genes combined with the accumulation of anthocyanins in flowers and the outer seed coats during development provide a more comprehensive list of putative genes involved in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway (Qin et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
