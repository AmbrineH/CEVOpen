<p class="p">Al-Maiman and Ahmad (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) studied total protein amounts in aril juice and seeds of Saudi Arabian pomegranate “Taifi” and compared unripe, half-ripe, and fully-ripe fruits. Protein concentration in seeds was found to be about four times higher than in the juice (an average of 4.06 vs. 1.05%). No significant changes were observed in protein concentration during fruit development in the seeds. The juice of unripe fruits contained significantly less proteins than the quantities in half-ripe and fully-ripe fruits (Al-Maiman and Ahmad, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Kulkarni and Aradhya (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) reported total protein content in squeezed separated arils of the Indian “Ganesh” at seven fruit developmental stages (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 days from fruit set). The study revealed significant changes in total protein content in the juice during fruit development. The highest total protein (209 mg/100 g) occurred 20 days after fruit set with a rapid decrease (66.9%) toward 80 days after fruit set. An increase (58.7%) occurred from 80 to 120 days and a significant slight decrease (6.3%) in total protein content occurred after 120 days (Kulkarni and Aradhya,
