<p class="p">The data on proteins in pomegranate fruits are limited and mainly concern total protein content in various tissues. Most of the studies do not report specific protein functions with the exception of storage proteins in the seeds and lipid transfer proteins in the arils. In general, the percent of total proteins in pomegranate juice is usually low, from &lt;1.0 to 1.1%, which is quite a narrow range. Diversely, the percent of total proteins in pomegranate seeds varies from 4.1 to 16.9%, which is quite a wide range. In this tissue, the presence of the storage proteins, globulins, albumins, glutelins, and prolamins, is prominent and the first two are the major proteins found in most of the studies.</p>
