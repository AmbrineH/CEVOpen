<p class="p">Elfalleh et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) studied proteins in the juice and pulp of two Tunisian commercial pomegranate cultivars. Protein content in the juice was 7.95 ± 0.89 g/L and differed significantly between the two cultivars (Elfalleh et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Elfalleh et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) studied fresh pomegranate juices (from arils only) and dry pulps of fully mature fruits from six local Tunisian ecotypes. The juice protein content was about 6.67 ± 2.26 g/L and the dry pulp protein content was 22.9%. The juice protein contents were significantly different, varying from 9.93 ± 1.90 g/L in “Chetoui” to 4.13 ± 1.20 g/L in “Gabsi 2.” The authors state that pomegranate is highly proteinic (~0.66%) compared to red wine (0.04%) and raw apple juice (0.27%) (Elfalleh et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Al-Maiman and Ahmad (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) studied total protein amounts in the aril juice of Saudi Arabian pomegranate “Taifi.” Fully-ripe fruits contained 1.05% protein in the juice (Al-Maiman and Ahmad, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Kulkarni and Aradhya (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) report total protein conteny of about 85 mg/100 g in the juice of ripe Indian “Ganesh” (100 days after fruit set).
