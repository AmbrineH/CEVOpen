<p class="p">As expected from these results, the TSS varied between the different collections. In 12 Tunisian cultivars, it ranged from 16.8 to 19.6 g/100 g (Hasnaoui et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), which was more than the range of three Indian varieties that show a range of 13.7–14.5 g/100 g (Dzugan et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). However, these values were much higher than the results reported for 4 Turkish varieties that ranged from 3.8 to 6.4 g/100 g (Orak et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), and the 29 varieties grown in Israel, which showed a range of 5.2–11.3 g/100 g. In these varieties, the peels had a 2- to 3-fold lower level of TSS compared with the aril juice (Dafny-Yalin et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>).
