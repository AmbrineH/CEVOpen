<p class="p">Several studies specifically measured the level of sugars and TSS in the fruit peel (Dafny-Yalin et al.,

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hasnaoui et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Ahmadi Gavlighi et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Notably, the major sugars that were detected in the peels differed between the varieties grown in Tunisia, Iran and Israel. In the 12 Tunisian varieties, xylose and arabinose represented more than 60% of the total content, followed by galactose (14%), glucose (~10%), mannose (~5%), rhamnose (~4%), and fucose (~1.5%) (Hasnaoui et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Peels from one Iranian variety showed that the main sugar is glucose (44.9–68.1%), followed by galactose (14.6–19.4%), mannose (3.4–18.1%), arabinose (3.1–18.1%), and rhamnose (3.5–6.0%) (Ahmadi Gavlighi et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). However, in the 29 worldwide varieties grown in Israel, the major sugars were glucose and fructose. The level of glucose varied in the range of 0.9–4.8 g/100 g (5.3-fold), and that of fructose in 0.9–6.6 g/100 g (6.6-fold). The level of fructose was higher than that of glucose in most of the varieties. Maltose was found at an about 50-fold lower concentration than that of glucose and fructose, in a range of 0.8–48.9 mg/100 g, while sucrose was detected in only 6 varieties at relatively low levels (up to 3.1 mg/100 g). Mannitol was also detected in all the varieties, ranging from 10 to 300 mg/100 g (Dafny-Yalin et al.,
