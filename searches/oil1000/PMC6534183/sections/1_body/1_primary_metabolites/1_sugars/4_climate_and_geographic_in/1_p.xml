<p class="p">Analysis of TSS and sugar content in different collections revealed that their values depended on climate and growth conditions. To gain more knowledge on the effect of the environmental conditions on the levels of sugars, 11 varieties from the Israeli collection in the Jezreel Valley (Mediterranean climate) were planted in Israel's southern Arava Valley (hot-dry desert climate). Arils from both habitats were analyzed. The varieties grown in Mediterranean climate showed significantly higher levels of glucose and fructose in the juice than those grown in a hotter habitat (Schwartz et al.,

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), showed that relatively higher temperatures can decrease sugar content, whereas cooler temperatures apparently promoted the increase in glucose and fructose. Thus, temperatures appear to play an important role in the sugar content of pomegranate juice.
