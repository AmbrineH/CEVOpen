<p class="p">Several studies followed the changes in the levels of sugars and TSS in aril juice during fruit development. The results taken from three cultivars (American and Indian) in South Africa (Fawole and Opara, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013c</xref>; Mphahlele et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), and two cultivars (Israeli and American) from Israel (Shwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) have shown that the level of TSS rose during the development process in accordance with the levels of glucose and fructose. The increase shown in the two Israeli grown varieties and in “Wonderful” in South Africa was significant (Schwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Mphahlele et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The presented data indicate that the developmental stage of the pomegranate fruit is associated with sugar accumulation.
