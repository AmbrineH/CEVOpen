 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) studied the peel powder of local Egyptian fruit obtained from the market. They found that glutamine (0.52 g/100 g), glycine (0.41 g/100 g), and aspartate (0.3 g/100 g) are the most abundant amino acids in the pomegranate peel powder studied. Tryptophan was not detected but all the other essential amino acids exist (

The peel powder studied contained an exceptionally higher content of lysine, isoleucine, methionine, and cysteine than the reference protein pattern of FAO/WHO (Rowayshed et al.,
