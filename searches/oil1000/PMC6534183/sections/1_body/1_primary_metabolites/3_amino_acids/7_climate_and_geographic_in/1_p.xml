 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) studied six pomegranate cultivars from Shandong (near the ocean) and Xinjiang (Eurasian continental climate) regions in China. The pomegranate juices from separated arils from Shandong had higher levels of total amino acids and of essential amino acids than those from Xinjiang. The total glutamate-, aspartate-, pyruvate-, and serine-related amino acids were higher in the Shandong juices, while the total aromatic amino acid contents were higher in the Xinjiang juices.
