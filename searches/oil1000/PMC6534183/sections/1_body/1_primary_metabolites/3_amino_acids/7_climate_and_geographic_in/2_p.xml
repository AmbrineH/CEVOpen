 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) quantified proline content in freshly pressed juice of three Turkish cultivars from three regions in 2 successive years. The authors found that the average proline content was 30 mg/L in the first year and 93 mg/L in the second, which was drier and hotter than the first year. The authors claim that this 3-fold increase in the second year indicates that climatic change affects proline accumulation (Halilova and Yildiz,
