<p class="p">There are only two studies involving amino acid profiling in pomegranate seeds (Elfalleh et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Rowayshed et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Elfalleh et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) studied amino acids in seeds of two Tunisian commercial pomegranate cultivars and Rowayshed et al. (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) studied local Egyptian varieties. Both revealed high proportions of glutamate (3.5 g/100 g), arginine (1.9 and 1.47 g/100 g respectively), and aspartate (1.9 and 1.21 g/100 g, respectively) in dry seeds. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2D</xref> shows the average results of these studies as percent of each amino acid of the total amino acids measured. Notably, the amino acid composition in seed powder was very similar to those found in peels of local Egyptian fruit (Rowayshed et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
