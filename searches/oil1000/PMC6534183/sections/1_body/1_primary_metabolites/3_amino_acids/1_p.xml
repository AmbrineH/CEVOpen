<p class="p">Amino acids are organic compounds that among other functions have an important role in protein biosynthesis and secondary metabolite syntheses. In addition to their role as building blocks of proteins, amino acids function as precursors or intermediates in biosynthetic pathways such as production of color molecules and volatiles in fruits, energy release through degradation, signaling processes in plant metabolism regulation and plant stress response (Creighton,
