<p class="p">Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) studied amino acids in juices of separated arils of six Chinese cultivars from two regions. Glutamine, serine, aspartate, and alanine are the most abundant amino acids in the juice, while glycine was not detected. All the essential amino acids exist but in smaller portions (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) analyzed fresh squeezed juice from three pomegranate fruits and three commercial pomegranate juices obtained from local markets (claimed to be 100% pomegranate). The authors did not specify if the juice was squeezed from separated arils or from the intact arils. In addition to the L-amino acids that were identified, D-proline was detected in all the juices and D-leucine in one of the commercial juices. L-serine, L-proline, and L-alanine are the most abundant amino acids in these pomegranates juices, while D-leucine was not detected (
