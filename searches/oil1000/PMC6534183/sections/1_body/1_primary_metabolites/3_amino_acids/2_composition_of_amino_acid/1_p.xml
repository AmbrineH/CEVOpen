<p class="p">There are just two studies involving amino acid profile in pomegranate juice and they are incomparable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In this context, it should be pointed out that different detection methods might result in different amino acid compositions. Thus, one cannot conclude in general the composition of amino acids in pomegranate juices excluding the fact that serine is found at high percentages in all juices studied.
