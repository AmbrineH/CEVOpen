<p class="p">A study on juices of six pomegranate cultivars grown in two regions in China revealed that the genotype of the pomegranate had a significant effect on the amino acid profile and content (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Clustering analysis relying on amino acid content showed segregation of amino acids in these pomegranate cultivar juices. This difference was mainly attributed to the differences in the content of cysteine, ornithine, aspartate, serine, methionine, and leucine. Analysis of proline in three Turkish cultivars from three regions in two successive years show that proline varied among pomegranate cultivars (Halilova and Yildiz,
