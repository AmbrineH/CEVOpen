<p class="p">The citric acid's level varies significantly between the different varieties. A range of 0.4–31.4 g/L, 78-fold difference in citric acid content was found among 12 Tunisian varieties (Hasnaoui et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>); 0.08–0.25 g/100 g, 30.7-fold variance among 40 Spanish varieties (Melgarejo et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>); 0.33–8.96 g/L, 27-fold among 13 Turkish varieties (Poyrazolua et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>); and 0.2–2.0 g/100g, 22-fold among 29 Israeli varieties (Dafny-Yalin et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In addition to citric acid, other organic acids were detected in the juice of pomegranates. These include malic, succinic, and oxalic acids (

In addition, traces of ascorbic, acetic, tartaric, quinic, fumaric, maleic, and lactic acids were detected in some accessions (Melgarejo et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Poyrazolua et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Aarabi et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). This suggests that citric acid is a major component of acidic taste in pomegranate fruits. Indeed, the level of citric acid shows a strong and positive correlation with total titratable acidity (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Hasnaoui et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). This value significantly changes between the different varieties. The values were about 15-fold in a study of 29 varieties in Israel (Dafny-Yalin et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), 10 varieties from Morocco and 40 from Tunisia (Hasnaoui et al.,

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>).
