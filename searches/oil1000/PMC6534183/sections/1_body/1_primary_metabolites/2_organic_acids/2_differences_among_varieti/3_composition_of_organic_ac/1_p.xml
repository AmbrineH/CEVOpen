<p class="p">As in the arils, the major organic acid in the peel is citric acid, but its level was about 3- to 5-fold lower compared to its level in the arils. The citric acid levels vary from 11 to 390 mg/100 g (13-fold) among the 29 cultivars (Dafny-Yalin et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Besides citric acid, malic acid (1.5–32 mg/100 g) and succinic acid (2.5–14 mg/100 g) were also detected in the peel. Eight out of 12 cultivars containing oxalic acid in their arils also contained oxalic acid in their peel (6–31 mg/100 g) (Dafny-Yalin et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Citric acid was also the dominant organic acid (507–1,678 mg/100 g) in the peels of six cultivars grown in Georgia, followed by malic (93–116 mg/100 g) and succinic acids (13–16.5 mg/100 g), while oxalic acid was found at a lower level (7.4–9.3 mg/100 g) (Pande and Akoh, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Total acidity values in peels ranged in four Turkish cultivars from 1.48 to 3.66% (Orak et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), from 0.27 to 1.23% in 29 Israeli varieties (Dafny-Yalin et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), from 0.97 to 1.39% in five Turkish cultivars (Gözlekçi et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), and from 0.36 to 0.40% in three Indian cultivars (Dzugan et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). The level of organic acids in pomegranate peel appears to be highly variable. The reasons for this could be manifold and depend on genetic background, methods of extraction and fruit ripening stage at harvest time. It appears that the developmental stage of the pomegranate fruit in sour cultivars is associated with reduction in total acidity.
