<p class="p">Since the level of sugars does not change much and that of acidity differs considerably among the varieties, acidity level is considered to be the main factor that determines the variability of taste in arils (Ben-Arie et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1984</xref>; Lobit et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). The ratio of TSS to total acidity values ranged significantly from 6.1 to 64.6 among 29 Israeli-grown varieties when the low values stand for the sour pomegranates and the high for the sweet fruits (Dafny-Yalin et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Measurements of 40 Spanish varieties revealed that in sour taste fruits, this ratio ranged from 32 to 96, and in fruits with a sour-sweet taste the values were 17â€“28 (Gil et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995b</xref>). In sweet and sour varieties in Italy the TSS to total acidity ratio ranged from 6.6 to 35.2 (Ferrara et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>).
