<p class="p">Several studies followed the levels of organic acids and titratable acidity in aril juice during fruit development. Indian and Tunisian cultivars grown in India (“Ganesh” and “Taifi”) (Kulkarni and Aradhya, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), and Israeli and American cultivars grown in Israel (“Rosh Hapered” and “Wonderful”) (Shwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) showed that total acidity decreased during fruit maturation. Respectively, the TSS to total acidity ratio and the pH increased across all the tested cultivars.
