<p class="p">During 10 weeks of the development and ripening of two cultivars grown in Israel (“Wonderful” and “Rosh Hapered”), the level of citric acid as well as that of total acidity in “Wonderful” decreased significantly. The content of citric acid in the sweet “Rosh Hapered” was the lowest compared to malic, succinic and oxalic acids, and was not significantly correlated with total acidity in this cultivar. The levels of malic and ascorbic acids increased in both cultivars during fruit development (Shwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Unlike the results obtained from two different studies done in Israel with “Wonderful” (Ben-Arie et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1984</xref>; Shwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), in South Africa, citric acid and succinic acid increased during the development of “Wonderful” while malic acid did not significantly change (Mphahlele et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). This increase in citric acid was observed despite the fact that total acidity decreased from 2.1 to 1.1 g/100 mL. Analysis of the levels of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) reveals that its level decreased significantly during the development of Tunisian and Indian cultivars (Al-Maiman and Ahmad, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Kulkarni and Aradhya, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). However, in the two cultivars that were grown in Israel, the content of ascorbic acid increased (Shwartz et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) during development. The differences in the content of citric acid in “Wonderful” between South Africa and other countries are intriguing in view of the fact that citric acid is a major organic acid that contributes to acidity and that total acidity decreased in all studies, including the one from South Africa.
