<p class="p">Total titratable acidity values were shown to be affected by climate and growth conditions. Arils from 11 varieties grown in the Jezreel Valley (Mediterranean climate) and in the Southern Arava Valley (hot-dry desert climate) were analyzed to study the effect of environmental and climatic conditions on the arils' acid content. The cultivars grown in Mediterranean climate had higher acidity levels compared to the acidity levels found in desert climate. This was in accordance with the higher contents of citric and malic acids, the two main organic acids in the arils (Schwartz et al.,
