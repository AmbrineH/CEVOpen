<p class="p">Generally sour cultivars are mostly grown in northern cold regions, while sweet cultivars with low acidity values are mostly found in regions having hot dry conditions. In Southern Spain and North Africa most of the commercialized cultivars have a sweet taste (Al-Kahtani, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>), while in North Turkey and Russia sour cultivars are commercialized (Gabbasova and Abdurazakova, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1969</xref>; Mayuoni-Kirshinbaum and Porat, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Alcaraz-Mármola et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). In northern regions such as Russia, Macedonia, Georgia, and Turkey, the total acidity ranged from 0.5 to 2.3% (Gabbasova and Abdurazakova, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1969</xref>), 0.6 to 2.2% (Pande and Akoh, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), 0.4 to 2.8% (Veres, 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>), and 1.7 to 4.6% (Poyrazolua et al., 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), respectively. However, in hot climates such as in India, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, total acidity values dropped to 0.12–0.13% (Al-Maiman and Ahmad, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), 0.03–0.10%, and 0.02–0.14%, respectively (Al-Kahtani, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>).
