<p class="p">To our best knowledge, only one study compared the content of seed oil among the same varieties under different climates. However, no study that deals with climate or geographical influence on fruit lipid composition was published. Seed oil content of several pomegranate varieties was measured for trees grown in a Mediterranean climate (Newe Ya'ar) and desert climate (Arava desert). Oil content ranged from 7.76 to 17.96 g/100 g of dried seeds, varying for the different accessions. Four accessions (P.G.114-15, P.G.116-17, P.G.128-29, and P.G.130-31) exhibited significantly higher oil contents when grown in the southern Arava compared to Newe Ya'ar. These results suggest that fruits grown in a hot dry climate may have higher oil content in their seeds (Schwartz et al.,
