<p class="p">Lipids are a group of small hydrophobic molecules that include fatty acids, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins, phospholipids, mono-, di-, and triglycerides. Primary and secondary lipids have diverse functions in living organisms, including energy storage, cell signaling, nutrition (fats and vitamins), hormones, transport, and structural components of cell membranes. The most lipid-rich fraction in pomegranates is the seeds, which contribute 10% to fruit weight. Generally, seed oil constitutes 6–20% of seed weight and contains a large quantity of lipids (Viuda-Martos et al., 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Ferrara et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The chain length of the lipids is divided to three classes: Medium- (C6–C12), long- (C14–C20), and very long (C22 and C24). The total lipid (the term refers to primary and secondary lipids) percentage in seeds varies from 4.4 to 27.2% (El-Nemr et al.,
