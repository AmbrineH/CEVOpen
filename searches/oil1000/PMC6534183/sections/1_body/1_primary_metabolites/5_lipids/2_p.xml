<p class="p">Punicic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in seed oil, constituting over 60% of the fatty acids, mostly followed by oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid in a variable order (

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Verardo et al., 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Most of the lipids were identified in the seeds, small amounts of lipids were also detected in aril juice and fruit peel. It should be mentioned that the presence of some of the lipids such as human steroid hormones is disputed (Choi et al.,
