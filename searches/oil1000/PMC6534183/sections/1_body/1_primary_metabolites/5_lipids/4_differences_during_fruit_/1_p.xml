<p class="p">Only one publication describes the changes that occur during seed development. Al-Maiman and Ahmad (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) studied unripe, half-ripe, and fully-ripe fruits of Saudi Arabian pomegranate “Taifi.” Lipid concentration in seeds during fruit maturation was 0.2, 0.01, and 0.25%, respectively and unsaturated fatty acids constituted 81.6, 82.1, and 84.6% of all fatty acids. No significant changes were observed in lipid concentration and fatty acid classes in the seeds during fruit development (Al-Maiman and Ahmad,
