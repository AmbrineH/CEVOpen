 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) studied the lipid composition (fatty acids, sterols, tocopherols, and phospholipids) of pomegranate seed oil from 17 varieties: (4 Israeli, 3 Spanish, 1 Turkish, 1 Iranian, 2 Tunisian, 6 Italian). The total lipid content (primary and secondary) of the pomegranate seeds varied from 7.6 to 16.2%. The oil consisted of 65–80% conjugated fatty acids of which punicic acid constituted 74–85%. Other major fatty acids were oleic, linoleic and palmitic acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids constituted 87.2% of the total seed oil, while monounsaturated fatty acids constituted 7.1% and saturated fatty acids constituted 5.7% of the total amount of fatty acids in the seed oil. Total sterol content varied between 7.5 and 16.4 mg/g of oil. The major phytosterols detected were campesterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol, Δ5-avenasterol, and citrostadienol. Sitosterol constituted 65–74% of the total sterols. Triterpene compounds cycloartenol and squalene constituted 0.8–2.4 mg/g oil (45.1%) and 0.7–3.2 mg/g (42.5%), respectively. Phospholipids were 0.4–2.3% of the total lipids and phosphatidylethanolamine was the main compound, constituting 56–86% of total phospholipids. In addition, total tocopherol content ranged between 678.3 and 2627.4 μg/g of oil, and γ-tocopherol, was 91% of the total tocopherols. There were significant differences between the varieties in fatty acids, sterols, phospholipids, and tocopherols. Differences were also found between variants of the same variety. Such are for example differences that were found between the landraces “Wonderful” and “Wonderful 1” in the content of oleic acid (17.34 and 32.07%, respectively), and squelene (0.91 and 3.18 mg/g oil, respectively) (Verardo et al.,
