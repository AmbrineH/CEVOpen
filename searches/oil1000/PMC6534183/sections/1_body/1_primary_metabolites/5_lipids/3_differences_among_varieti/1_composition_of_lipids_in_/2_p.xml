<p class="p">Jing et al. (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) studied the lipid composition of extracted seed oil from four Chinese cultivars from Shanxi. Oil content in the seeds ranged from 114.2 to 147.9 mg/g and was significantly different between cultivars. Seed oil was rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (87–92% of fatty acids), which were significantly different in the four cultivars. Punicic acid was the dominant fatty acid (73.5–78.8 g/100 g fatty acids). Total tocopherols ranged from 2,188 to 4,947 μg/g. The four cultivars were significantly different in their lipid content (Jing et al.,
