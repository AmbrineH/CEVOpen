<p class="p">The profile of fatty acids and phytosterols in pomegranate seed oil from four varieties grown in Israel was determined. Results showed linolenic acid to be the predominant fatty acid (64–83%). The linolenic acid fraction was composed of four different chromatographically separate peaks that are assumed to be attributed to different isomers of conjugated linolenic acid, and punicic acid was the major isomer. Phytosterols were found at quite a high concentration (4,089–6,205 mg/kg) with a wide variety of components, and the major phytosterols were β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol (Kaufman and Wiesman,

Fatty acid and tocopherol composition in the seed oil of nine worldwide pomegranate varieties that were grown in Spain was analyzed resulting in 4.4–12.0% oil content. Over 86% of the oil were unsaturated fatty acids, mainly punicic acid, ranging between 77.3 and 83.6% of total fatty acids. Total tocopherols ranged from 174.5 to 627.3 mg/100 g oil, mainly γ-tocopherol. There were significant differences between the cultivars (Fernandes et al.,
