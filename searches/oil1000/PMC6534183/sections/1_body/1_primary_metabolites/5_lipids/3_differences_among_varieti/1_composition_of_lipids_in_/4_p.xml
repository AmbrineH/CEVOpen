Oil was extracted from dry seeds of commercially ripe fresh fruits from Markazi and Yazd provinces in Iran. Oil content ranged from 6.6 to 19.3% (W/W). The pre-dominant fatty acid was linolenic acid–31.8–86.6%—followed by linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid (Fadavi et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Worth noticing is the fact that punicic acid was not detected in this study. This fatty acid was found to be the predominant acid in pomegranates in many other studies but was not detected in these varieties. Since punicic and linolenic acids are isomers, this might be a result of different classification or misinterpretation of the molecule's nature. Differences between the varieties were significant. Moreover, differences were found in the lipid contents of sweet, sour, and sour sweet varieties while the lowest was in sweet varieties and the highest in sour sweet.
