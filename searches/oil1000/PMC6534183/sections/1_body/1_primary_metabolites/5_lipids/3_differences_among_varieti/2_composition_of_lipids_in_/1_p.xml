 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) investigated the lipid profiles of six Georgia (USA) pomegranate varieties. Ripe fruits were used for the preparation of two fractions: seed tissue and non-seed tissues (peels and juice). Total lipid content in the seeds was 18.1–21.5% and 0.2–0.3% in the non-seed fraction. Punicic acid was the predominant fatty acid in the seed lipids and linoleic acid was the major fatty acid in the non-seed fraction. All the varieties had the same saturated/unsaturated fatty acids ratio of 0.1 for the seeds and 0.5 for non-seed tissues. Linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid are most abundant in aril juice and peel and are secondary in abundance in seeds; however, punicic acid was not detected in the non-seed tissues. Pomegranate seed had a high content of α- and γ-tocopherol (167.3 and 84.6 mg/100 g, respectively). The most abundant phytosterol was β-sitosterol, ranging from 32.7 to 345.8 mg/100 g. There were more phospholipids in seeds than in aril juice and peel. Phosphatidylcholine content varied from 5.8 to 23.1 mg/100 g and phosphatidylethanolamine ranged from 10.2 to 74.2 mg/100 g in all the seed varieties. Significant differences were found between the four cultivars in their different lipid components (Pande and Akoh,
