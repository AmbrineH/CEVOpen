<p class="p">Lipids were also studied in local varieties from some other countries. Fatty acid content was studied in seeds of fully ripened local market Egyptian pomegranate fruits. Total lipids were 27.2% with saturated fatty acids being 83.6% of the total fatty acids. The predominant acid was caprylic acid (36.3%), followed by stearic acid, oleic and linoleic acids out of 11 fatty acids that were identified (El-Nemr et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>). Punicic acid or linolenic acid were not detected. The oil content and fatty acid composition of the seed oil of seven Spanish sweet pomegranate varieties was 6.3–12.2%, of which 73.4–95.8% were unsaturated fatty acids. The predominant fatty acid was linolenic acid (43.4–88.2%), followed by linoleic acid, oleic acid, and palmitoleic acid. Differences in fatty acid composition were found among the varieties studied (Melgarejo and Artes, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). Fatty acid composition in the seed oil of 25 pomegranates varieties from two different regions of India showed oil content of 6.6–19.3%, most of it unsaturated fatty acids. The predominant fatty acid was linolenic acid (31.8–86.6%), followed by linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid and palmitoleic acid. The varieties studied had similar but not identical fatty acid composition Parashar et al.,
