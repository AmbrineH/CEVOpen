 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) studied the oil content and fatty acid composition of 13 sweet and sour pomegranate genotypes from Puglia region in Southeastern Italy, of which 3 were of Israeli origin. The oil extracted from the dried seeds and the content of total lipids were significantly variable among these genotypes, ranging from 10.7 to 26.8% in sweet genotypes and from 4.9 to 17.4% in sour genotypes. Sixteen fatty acids were identified in this study, among which punicic acid was the major fatty acid in all genotypes. Punicic acid content exceeded 74.9%, followed by palmitic, linoleic, stearic, and oleic acids. There was low variability of fatty acid composition between the genotypes. Unsaturated fatty acids in the seed oils constituted between 86.7 and 91.2% with saturated/unsaturated ratios ranging between 0.10 and 0.15 (Ferrara et al.,
