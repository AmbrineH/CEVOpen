<p class="p">High variability was reported for pomegranate fruit that manifests, among other phenomena, considerable differences in size, shape, color, date of ripening, and taste. This external variability is interesting in view of the fact that the only edible species among the 
 <italic class="italic">Punica</italic>, which include only two species, is the cultivated pomegranate (
 <italic class="italic">P. granatum</italic> L.). The only other pomegranate known to science is the non-edible species 
 <italic class="italic">Punica protopunica</italic>, endemic to Socotra (Holland et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The fruit of this species is small and not colorful and no biochemical, genetic, or molecular studies of its fruit were published. This high variability is also reflected in the content of primary and secondary metabolites. Quite substantial work has been devoted in recent years to determining primary metabolites in the pomegranate fruit. These efforts include studies of sugar, organic acids, protein, amino acids, and lipid content and composition. In general, the pomegranate fruit consists of 50% peel, 40% arils, and 10% seeds (per weight). The arils contain 85% water, 10% total sugars, 1.5% metabolites and bioactive compounds such as organic acids, phenolics, and flavonoids (Tezcan et al., 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The seeds are a rich source of lipids; pomegranate seed oil comprises 12â€“20% of total seed weight (Viuda-Martos et al., 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). It appears that primary and secondary metabolites showed extensive variability due to the fact that the fruit used for the various studies originated from different varieties and highly variable climatic conditions and taken from trees grown under different agro-technical methods. While pomegranate reviews published up until now focused mainly on secondary metabolites (e.g., polyphenols, anthocyanins), there are only few that focused on primary metabolites, despite their great importance to taste attributes and to the nutritional index of the fruit. In this review, we focus on primary metabolites and on secondary metabolites, anthocyanins and hydrolizable tannins, with special attention to the variability of their content and composition. A special effort was aimed at the developmental, genetic, and environmental effects on the content and composition of primary metabolites. Whenever available, primary metabolites in each of the fruit organ, peel, arils, and seeds, were specified.
