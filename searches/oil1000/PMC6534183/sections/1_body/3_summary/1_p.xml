<p class="p">In this review, we have made an effort to summarize the most updated data on primary metabolites and on the most notable secondary metabolites of pomegranate fruit. Along with this effort, it was important for us to reflect the variability of metabolite content and composition and its dependence on the genetic background and environmental conditions. Finally, we present a summary of the main metabolites identified in pomegranate fruit peel, aril juice, and seed tissues (
