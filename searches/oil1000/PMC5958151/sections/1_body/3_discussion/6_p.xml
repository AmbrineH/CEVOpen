<p id="Par26" class="p">The increasing number of cases of human and animal protothecosis caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Prototheca</italic> algae, including mastitis, and increasing resistance to routine antifungal chemotherapeutics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], has prompted intense research into new anti-algae agents by researchers and commercial companies. Numerous in vitro studies have shown that the oils of various plants demonstrate effective antimicrobial activity against pathogenic strains of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Prototheca</italic>, due to their high levels of polyphenols, catechins and isoflavones, together with various other biologically active compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Studies carried out by Bouari (Cuc) et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> on a mouse model show that mint oil (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic>) and savory oil (
 <italic class="italic">S. hortensis</italic>) are highly effective against skin symptoms caused by
