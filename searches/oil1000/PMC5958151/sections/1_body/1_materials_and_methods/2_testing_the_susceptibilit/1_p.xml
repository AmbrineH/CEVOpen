 <italic class="italic">P. zopfii</italic> isolates were cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (bioMerieux, Poland) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under aerobic conditions. Algae suspensions were prepared with an optical density of 0.5 on the McFarland scale using a densitometer (Den-1B McFarland BioSan Densitometer). Antibiotic susceptibility was investigated by the disk diffusion method on Yeast Nitrogen Base Agar (Becton Dickinson and Company, USA) or on Mueller-Hinton II Agar (Graso, Poland). The following antifungal chemotherapeutic agents were used (Graso, Poland): nystatin (100 μg), amphotericin B (20 μg), clotrimazole (10 μg), miconazole (10 μg), ketoconazole (10 μg), fluconazole (25 μg), econazole (10 μg), flucytosine (1 μg). The results were verified after 24 and 48 h of incubation at 37 °C for all antimicrobials. The inhibitory zone diameters were measured and interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) [
