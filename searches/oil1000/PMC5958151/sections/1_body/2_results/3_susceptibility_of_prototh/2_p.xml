<p id="Par20" class="p">The weakest tested oils worked on strain 71/IV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) which was resistant to all antibiotics used (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The most effective was marjoram essential oil (MIC: 0.5–1 μl/ml); thyme oil and oregano (MIC: 1 μl/ml) were less effective. MIC values were obtained for strain 48/IV (marjoram oil—MIC: 0.25 μl/ml, thyme oil and oregano—MIC: 1 μl/ml) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
