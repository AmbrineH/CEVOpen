 <p> Effect of the essential oil (EO) from the leaves of Croton matourensis in the cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells. ( A) Percentage of cells with sub-G 0/G 1 DNA content (DNA fragmentation). ( B) Percentage of cells with G 0/G 1 phase DNA content. ( C) Percentage of cells with S phase DNA content. ( D) Percentage of cells with G 2/M phase DNA content. The negative control (CTL) was treated with the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) used for diluting the EO. Doxorubicin (DOX, 1 µg/mL) was used as the positive control. Data are presented as the means ± SEM. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. * P &lt; 0.05 compared with the negative control by ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. </p>
