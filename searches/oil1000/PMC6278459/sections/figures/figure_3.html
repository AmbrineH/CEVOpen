 <p> In vivo antitumor activity of the essential oil (EO) from the leaves of Croton matourensis in C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HepG2 cell xenografts. ( A) Tumor weight (g) after treatment. ( B) Tumor inhibition (%) after treatment. Beginning 1 day after tumor implantation, the animals were treated through the intraperitoneal route for 21 consecutive days. The negative control (CTL) was treated with the vehicle (5% DMSO) used for diluting the EO. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 10 mg/kg/day) was used as the positive control. Data are presented as means ± SEM. of 10–20 animals. * P &lt; 0.05 compared to the negative control by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. </p>
