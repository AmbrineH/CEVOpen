  <p class="p">Effect of the essential oil (EO) from the leaves of 
   <italic class="italic">Croton matourensis</italic> on the induction of apoptosis (early + late apoptotic cells) in HepG2 cells after 48 h of treatment, as determined by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The negative control (CTL) was treated with the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) used for diluting the EO. Doxorubicin (DOX, 1 µg/mL) was used as the positive control. Data are presented as the means ± SEM. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. *
