 <p> Effect of the essential oil (EO) from the leaves of Croton matourensis on the induction of apoptosis (early + late apoptotic cells) in HepG2 cells after 48 h of treatment, as determined by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The negative control (CTL) was treated with the vehicle (0.1% DMSO) used for diluting the EO. Doxorubicin (DOX, 1 µg/mL) was used as the positive control. Data are presented as the means ± SEM. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. * P &lt; 0.05 compared with the negative control by ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. </p>
