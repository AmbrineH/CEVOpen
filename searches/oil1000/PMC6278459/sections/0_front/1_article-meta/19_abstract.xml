  <italic class="italic">Croton matourensis</italic> Aubl. (synonym 
  <italic class="italic">Croton lanjouwensis</italic> Jabl.), popularly known as “orelha de burro”, “maravuvuia”, and/or “sangrad’água”, is a medicinal plant used in Brazilian folk medicine as a depurative and in the treatment of infections, fractures, and colds. In this work, we investigated the chemical composition and in vitro cytotoxic and in vivo antitumor effects of the essential oil (EO) from the leaves of 
  <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> collected from the Amazon rainforest. The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus and characterized qualitatively and quantitatively by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC–FID), respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity of the EO was assessed in cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HCT116, HepG2, and HL-60) and the non-cancer cell line (MRC-5) using the Alamar blue assay. Furthermore, annexin V-FITC/PI staining and the cell cycle distribution were evaluated with EO-treated HepG2 cells by flow cytometry. In vivo efficacy of the EO (40 and 80 mg/kg/day) was demonstrated in C.B-17 severe combined 
  <italic class="italic"/>immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HepG2 cell xenografts. The EO included β-caryophyllene, thunbergol, cembrene, 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, and β-elemene as major constituents. The EO exhibited promising cytotoxicity and was able to cause phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation without loss of the cell membrane integrity in HepG2 cells. In vivo tumor mass inhibition rates of the EO were 34.6% to 55.9%. Altogether, these data indicate the anticancer potential effect of
