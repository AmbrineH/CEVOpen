 <xref rid="molecules-23-02974-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The terpenoid class fully dominated the EO sample composition, in which, sesquiterpenes were the main representatives (46.53%), followed by diterpenes (26.94%), and monoterpenes (25.02%). Among them, 42 (representing 90.00% of the EO) were identified based on their retention indexes and mass spectral-fragments. The major compounds in the EO were β-caryophyllene (12.41 ± 1.02%), thunbergol (11.74 ± 1.11%), cembrene (7.12 ± 0.55%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (5.05 ± 0.49%), and β-elemene (4.94 ± 0.35%).
