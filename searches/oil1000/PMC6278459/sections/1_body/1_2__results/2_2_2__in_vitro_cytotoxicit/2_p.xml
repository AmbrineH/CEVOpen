<p class="p">Then, we quantified the cell viability using annexin V-FITC and PI double staining, and the cell fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of HepG2 cells in viable (cells that are annexin V-FITC/PI double-negative), early apoptotic (cells that are annexin V-FITC-positive and PI-negative), late apoptotic (cells that are annexin V-FITC/PI double-positive), and necrotic (cells that are annexin V-FITC-negative and PI-positive) stages after 48 h of treatment with the EO at concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 µg/mL, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02974-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. These concentrations were based at the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (28.5 µg/mL) of the EO for HepG2 cells, and since the doubling time of HepG2 cell is about 48 h, we used this time of treatment to evaluate the effect of the EO after one full cell cycle. The EO treatment caused an increase of the apoptotic (early + late apoptotic cells) cell death after 48 h of treatment (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). No increase in the necrotic (annexin V-FITC-negative/PI-positive) cells was observed (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Doxorubicin also led to an increase of the apoptotic cells (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). At the concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL, the EO increased the apoptotic cell death to 12.1%, 23.6%, and 25.7%, against 6.3% observed at the control group. Doxorubicin, at 1 μg/mL, increased the apoptosis to 20.7%.
