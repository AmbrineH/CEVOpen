<p class="p">The cell cycle distribution in the EO-treated HepG2 cells was performed by the DNA content using flow cytometry after 48 h of treatment, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02974-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. All DNA that was sub-diploid in size (sub-G
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>/G
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) was considered fragmented. EO-treated HepG2 cells presented an internucleosomal DNA fragmentation significantly increased (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Doxorubicin also significantly induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). At the concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL, the EO increased the DNA fragmentation to 10.0%, 13.2%, and 40.5%, against 7.0% observed at the control group. Doxorubicin, at 1 μg/mL, increased the DNA fragmentation to 22.4%. The cell cycle phases G
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>/G
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, S, and G
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/M were reduced proportionally.
