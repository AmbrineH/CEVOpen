<p class="p">In vitro cytotoxicity of the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> to human cancer cell lines MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), HCT116 (colon carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), and human non-cancer cell line MRC-5 (lung fibroblasts) was assessed by the Alamar blue assay after 72 h of treatment. 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02974-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> presents the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) obtained. The EO displayed an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 23.3 µg/mL for MCF-7, 28.9 µg/mL for HCT116, 28.5 µg/mL for HepG2, 17.8 µg/mL for HL-60, and 25.8 µg/mL for MRC-5. Doxorubicin was used as the positive control and showed an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.3 µg/mL for MCF-7, 0.1 µg/mL for HCT116, 0.03 µg/mL for HepG2, 0.04 µg/mL for HL-60, and 0.2 µg/mL for MRC-5.
