<p class="p">In vivo antitumor effect of the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> was assessed in C.B-17 severe combined 
 <italic class="italic"/>immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HepG2 cell xenografts. Animals were treated with the EO at doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg/day through intraperitoneal injections delivered once a day for 21 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment, the mean tumor mass weight of the negative control animals was 0.5 ± 0.1 g, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02974-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A. In the EO-treated animals, the mean tumor mass weights were 0.3 ± 0.1 g at 40 mg/kg/day dosage and 0.2 ± 0.03 g at 80 mg/kg/day dosage. Tumor mass inhibition rates of the EO were 34.6% to 55.9% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02974-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B. In this study, 5-fluorouracil at the dosage of 10 mg/kg/day was used as the positive control, which reduced the tumor weight by 44.2%.
