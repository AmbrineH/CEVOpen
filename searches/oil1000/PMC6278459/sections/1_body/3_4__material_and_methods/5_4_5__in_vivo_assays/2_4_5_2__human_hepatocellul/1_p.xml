<p class="p">HepG2 cells (10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> cells per 500 ÂµL) were implanted subcutaneously into the left front armpits of the mice. At the beginning of the experiment, mice were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1: animals received injections of vehicle with 5% DMSO solution (

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Beginning 1 day after tumor implantation, the animals were treated through the intraperitoneal route for 21 consecutive days. One day after the end of the treatment, animals were anesthetized, and peripheral blood samples were collected from the brachial artery. Animals were euthanized by anesthetic overdose, and tumors were excised and weighed.
