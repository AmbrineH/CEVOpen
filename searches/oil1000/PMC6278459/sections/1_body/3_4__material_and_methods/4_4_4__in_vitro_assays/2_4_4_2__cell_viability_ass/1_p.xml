<p class="p">Cell viability was measured by the Alamar blue assay and was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. For all experiments, cells were plated in 96-well plates. The EO was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Vetec Química Fina Ltd., Duque de Caxias, RJ, Brazil) and added to each well and incubated for 72 h. Doxorubicin (purity ≥ 95%, doxorubicin hydrochloride, Laboratory IMA S.A.I.C., Buenos Aires, Argentina) was used as the positive control. At the end of the treatment, 20 μL of a stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well. Absorbances at 570 and 600 nm were measured using a SpectraMax 190 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
