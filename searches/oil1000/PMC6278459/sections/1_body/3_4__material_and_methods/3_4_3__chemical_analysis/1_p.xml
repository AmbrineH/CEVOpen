<p class="p">The qualitative analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with an equipment model GCMS/QP2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using a selective detector and a capillary column Rtx-5 MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25, Restek). Helium was used as carrier gas with a flow of 1.02 mL/min. Injections (1 μL) were performed with EO solutions at 2 mg/mL in CH

The temperatures of the injector and the ion source were 220 °C and 260 °C, respectively. Preliminary identifications of the constituents were performed based on comparison of experimental spectra with those stored in the Wiley 8th edition library (similarities &gt; 90%). The confirmation of the identifications was performed by the calculation of the retention indexes (RI) according to the Van den Dool and Kratz equation [

A semi-quantitative analysis was performed to obtain the relative amount of each component of the EO. For this procedure, a gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) system, model GC2010 (Shimadzu) equipped with a Rtx-5 capillary column, was used. The same conditions of the GC-MS analysis were employed to ensure reproducibility. Relative amounts (%) were calculated in relation to the total area of the chromatogram.
