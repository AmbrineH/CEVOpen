<p class="p">In this study, antitumor effect of the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> was reported for the first time at this communication. As mentioned above, a previous study investigated the chemical composition and cytotoxic activity of the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> collected in Venezuela [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. These authors found fenchyl acetate, methyleugenol, isoelemicine, elemicine, spathulenol, and valencene as the main constituents of this EO
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> Moreover, previous studies with the EO from the leaves, fruit, inflorescence, and bark of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> collected from the Brazilian Amazon rainforest presented 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, elemecine, α-phellandrene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, linalool, and β-caryophyllene as the main constituents [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Herein, we observed a different chemical composition of the EO for 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> in comparison with individuals collected in Venezuela, where β-caryophyllene, thunbergol, cembrene, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, and β-elemene were found as major constituents. Interestingly, when compared to with a specimen collected in central Amazonia, especially, in Brazil, a similar chemical composition is observed.
