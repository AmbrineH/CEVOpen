<p class="p">In the work of Compagnone et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> caused cytotoxicity in LoVo (human colon carcinoma) and HeLa (human cervical cancer) cell lines with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 36.6 and 83.9 μg/mL, respectively, while inducing cytotoxicity in human dermis fibroblasts cells with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 132.7 μg/mL. In this work, we observed similar results where the EO was cytotoxic with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 23.3 µg/mL for MCF-7, 28.9 µg/mL for HCT116, 28.5 µg/mL for HepG2, 17.8 µg/mL for HL-60, and 25.8 µg/mL for MRC-5.
