<p class="p">Phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation, without loss of the cell membrane integrity, are cellular biochemical alterations that are often correlated with the apoptotic cell death [

 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> increased the phosphatidylserine exposure and internucleosomal DNA, without causing alterations in the cell membrane integrity (no increase in the PI-positive cells was observed). Moreover, the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia gracilis, Guatteria blepharophylla</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Guatteria hispida</italic> inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death by apoptosis in HepG2 cells [
