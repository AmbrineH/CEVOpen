<p class="p">In addition, we demonstrated that the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> has in vivo antitumor effect in C.B-17 SCID mice with HepG2 cell xenografts. The antitumor effect of the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. regelianus</italic> has been previously reported using sarcoma 180 as tumor model, while the EO inhibited the tumor development by 28.1% and 31.8%, at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, and the ascaridole, one of its main constituents, inhibited the tumor development by 33.9% and 33.3%, at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-02974" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Herein, the EO from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. matourensis</italic> inhibited the tumor mass by 34.6% to 55.9% at doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively, and although the EO was less potent than the positive control 5-fluorouracil, the EO presented similar or superior efficacy to that observed for it. The positive control 5-fluorouracil inhibited the tumor mass by 44.2% at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day.
