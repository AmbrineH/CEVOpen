<p class="p">Studies on the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on microbiota have mainly focused on the major bacterial phyla 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> in animal models. Omega-3 PUFAs from flaxseed seem to decrease the proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], and those from fish oil appear to lower the population of 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. An increase in the 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio has been linked to weight gain and other metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, in part by the synthesis of SCFAs.
