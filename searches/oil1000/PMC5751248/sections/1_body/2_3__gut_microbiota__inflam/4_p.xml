<p class="p">As mentioned above, diet is one of the strongest selective pressures for microbial communities within the gastrointestinal tract. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-02645-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> summarizes the studies that have investigated the role of PUFAs on microbiota. Several studies have demonstrated that feeding a high-fat diet (i.e., 45–60% kcal from fat) influences the types and amounts of gut microbes and adversely affects intestinal health. In particular, a high-fat diet is implicated in dysbiosis, including a decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> and an increase in both 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> in the murine model [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], a reduction of microbiota richness in terms of the number of species per sample [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], as well as an increase in LPS-producing bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobactericeae</italic> and/or a decrease in LPS-suppressing bacteria (those which can lower the numbers of LPS-producing bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic>). Moreover, a high-fat diet results in epithelial alterations, such as intestinal barrier dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]; a higher intestinal permeability [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]; and an increased LPS translocation that can diffuse from the gut to the bloodstream, either by direct diffusion mediated by para-cellular permeability or through absorption by enterocytes during chylomicron secretion [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Current evidence suggests that dietary fat augments the circulating LPS concentrations. The resultant postprandial endotoxemia leads to low-grade systemic inflammation, which has been implicated in the development of several metabolic diseases, insulin resistance, adipocyte hyperplasia and reduction of pancreatic β-cell function [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], and impaired glucose metabolism [
