<p class="p">Studies on mice-transplanted faeces showed that the omega-3 PUFAs can modify the microbiota through the production and secretion of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), leading to a reduction in the number of LPS-producing bacteria, thus reducing metabolic endotoxemia [

 <xref rid="B59-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] showed that, in diet-induced obese mice, supplementation with a combination of EPA and DHA significantly increased the quantities of

Dietary PUFAs have been suggested to affect the attachment sites for the gastrointestinal microbiota, possibly by modifying the fatty acid composition of the intestinal wall [
