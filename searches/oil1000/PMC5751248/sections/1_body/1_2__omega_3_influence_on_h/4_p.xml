<p class="p">In another case report, Noriega and co-workers analyzed the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on human gut microbiota using NGS technology [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-18-02645" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In this study, a daily supplementation of 600 mg of omega-3 PUFAs through a fish protein diet was implemented for two weeks in one 45-year-old man. This intervention led to an increase in the 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> phylum, and to a simultaneous decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>. Moreover, a reduction in 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium</italic> genus versus an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Blautia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Coprococcus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Subdoligranulum</italic> genera was recorded. Some of these recorded genera are still associated with butyrate production. However, after two washout weeks, a reversal trend was observed, indicating that gut microbiota is strongly sensitive to diet changes [
