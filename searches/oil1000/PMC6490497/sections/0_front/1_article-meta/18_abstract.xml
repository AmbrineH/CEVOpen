  <p class="p">Candida species are the most common opportunistic fungal infections. Today, cinnamon plants have been considered for anti-Candida properties.</p>

  <title class="title">AIM:</title>
  <p class="p">This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of cinnamaldehyde extract (from cinnamon derivatives) on 
   <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic> species and comparison with nystatin.

  <title class="title">MATERIAL AND METHODS:</title>
  <p class="p">In this study, cinnamaldehyde and nystatin were used. The specimens included 
   <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic>. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were measured for each one by the microdilution method. This experiment was repeated three times.

  <title class="title">RESULTS:</title>
  <p class="p">Cinnamaldehyde extract at a concentration of 62.5 μl/ml was able to prevent the growth of 
   <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, at a concentration of 93.7 μl/ml, causing 
   <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> to disappear, at 48.8 μl/ml, to prevent the growth of 
   <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic>, and in the concentration of 62.5 μl/ml, causes the loss of 
   <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic>. In comparison, nystatin at 0.5 μg/ml concentration prevented the growth of 
   <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, at concentrations of 1 μg/ml causing 
   <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> to be destroyed, at 4 μg/ml concentration to prevent the growth of 
   <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic>, and at a concentration of 8 μg/ml causes the loss of 
   <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic>. The results were the same every three times.

  <title class="title">CONCLUSIONS:</title>
  <p class="p">Although cinnamaldehyde extract had an effect on fungal growth in both 
   <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic> with a fatal effect; the effect on these two species was lower than nystatin.
