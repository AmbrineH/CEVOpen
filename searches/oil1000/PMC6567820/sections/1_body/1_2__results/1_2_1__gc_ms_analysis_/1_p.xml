<p class="p">The fatty acid composition of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed-extracted oil was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. A representative chromatogram is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a. The identity of the peak was analyzed using fatty acid standards and the MS database. The percentages of fatty acid esters were obtained by calculating the peak area ratios, which are listed in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-02579-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The results show that 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seeds contain 5.35% of palmitic acid (C16:0), 0.9% stearic acid (C18:0), 52.46% oleic acid (C18:1), 7.19% linoleic acid (C18:2), 1.61% linolenic acid (C18:3), 6.84% arachidic acid (C20:0), 23.71% eicosenic acid (C20:1), 1.24% bechenic acid, and 0.68% erucic acid (C22:1).
