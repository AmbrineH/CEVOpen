<p class="p">The in vivo skin wound healing activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil extract is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. Two days after the skin excision, the typical healing responses inside the epidermis of the wound were obviously better in the group treated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil. During the initial two days of healing, the wounds of both the oil-treated and control groups developed hyperemic areas with well-defined borders that preserved the rectangular shape of the wound. In the oil-treated group, the wounds underwent accelerated healing with the growth of granulation tissue, absence of edema, and lower secretions than in the untreated control group. In addition, a quantitative assessment demonstrated that the in vivo experimental wounds treated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil (74.14 ± 1.64%) showed a statistically significant reduction (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the wound area compared to that of the control wounds (91.02% ± 7.44%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). This statistically significant reduction in wound size was observed at all the experimental time points.
