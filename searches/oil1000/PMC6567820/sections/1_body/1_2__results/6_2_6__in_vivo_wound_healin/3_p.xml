 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). The brown color and dryness of the untreated wounds on day 12 were similar to the oil-treated wounds on the 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day. However, the treated wounds showed complete resurfacing of the epithelial layer, and the wound was almost entirely covered by hair. At this healing stage, the average percentage wound size for the control and oil-treated wounds was 13.55% ± 3.40% and 7.20% ± 1.52%, respectively (
