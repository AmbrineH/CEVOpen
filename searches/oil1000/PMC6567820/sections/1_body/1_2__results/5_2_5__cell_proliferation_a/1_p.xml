<p class="p">The in vitro cell experiments demonstrated that the cells treated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> oil exhibited a traditional growth curve. The seed oil-extract significantly enhanced the viability of the tested CCD-966SK cells on day 2 (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). After three days of culture, 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil showed no proliferation or cytotoxicity effect on the cultured cells. The scratch assay results showed that treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil enhanced the CCD-966SK cell migration toward the scratched area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The microscopic images revealed that the leading cells at the wound edge oriented towards the wound area 6 h after the scratch trauma was inflicted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b,f). Additionally, the quantitative analysis of wound closure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>) showed that wound closure rate for the oil-treated cells was 24.73%, which is higher than that of the control cells (6.45%) at 6 h. After a 12-hour culture period, the border of the wound became unclear. In addition, a greater number of migrating cells were noted at the scratch edge in the oil-treated sample than in the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>c,g). The oil-treated cells demonstrated a 3.36-fold higher percentage of scratch-width closure than the control cells. At 24 h, the migrating cells had moved to the center of the scratch wound (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>d,h). The oil-treated CCD-966SK cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>h) displayed significantly increased healing ability compared to the controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>d). The wound width closure of the oil-treated group after 24 h of culture was 82.79%, which was 1.88-fold greater than that of the controls (44.08%) (
