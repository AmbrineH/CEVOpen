 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil significantly affected nitric oxide (NO) release in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated cells. The NO release of the samples was normalized by comparing the measured data to the untreated samples. When the cells were treated with 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-nitro-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-arginine-methyl ester (
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-NAME), 21% NO release was noted compared to the control. When the cells were pretreated with 25 μg/mL 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil, NO release by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 cells was 92%. This value dramatically decreased to 46% when 500 μg/mL oil was used for pretreatment.
