<p class="p">Interestingly, 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-02579-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows that the main components of the monounsaturated fatty acids in 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil were oleic acid (52.46%) and eicosenic acid (23.71%). Since oleic acid strongly inhibited the production of NO at the wound site [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and were positive for wounding healing, it is not a surprise that the tested 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil strongly promoted the skin wound healing process as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>. Except for monounsaturated FAs, linoleic acid also plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier for maintaining water permeability. In 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-02579-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, we show that the extracted 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil contains 7.2% linoleic acid and 23.71% eicosenic acid. Since both linoleic acid and eicosenic acid directly play a role as activators that enhance skin cell proliferation [
