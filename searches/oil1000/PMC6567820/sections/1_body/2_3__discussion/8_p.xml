 <xref rid="ijms-20-02579-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> is not fully understood. The most likely mechanism of the antimicrobial action of S. 
 <italic class="italic">mukorossi</italic> seed oil is the Î²-sitosterol content because it is a potent antimicrobial agent at low concentrations [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In addition, it is reported that acidic plant oils are not conducive to the growth of bacteria, which require a neutral pH environment for growth [

 <xref rid="B32-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Such an acidic environment also leads to the promotion of cell proliferation (

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Since fibroblast proliferation and migration are vital steps in skin wound healing [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] when this phenomenon is considered in combination with the efficiency of skin wound healing shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02579-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, we suggest that S.
