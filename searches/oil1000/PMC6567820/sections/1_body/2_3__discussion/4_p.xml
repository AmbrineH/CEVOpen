 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil enhanced skin wound healing. In 2018, Lin et al. reviewed the pharmacological and medical effects of several plant oils and concluded that the therapeutic benefits for skin wound healing of plant oils are provided by their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. We found that 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil is rich in β-sitosterol and δ-tocopherol (vitamin E) (

 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil are 7.3% and 0.235%, respectively. These values are much higher than the analogous quantities in shea butter (0.8% for sterols and 0.08% for tocopherols) [
