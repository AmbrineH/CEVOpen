<p class="p">The phytochemical characteristics of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil used in this study were determined by a series of tests. The GC-MS results show that the fatty acid contained in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seeds oil was similar to that of previous reports [

 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The most significant phytochemical finding of the tested 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil is that it contains a substantial amount of unsaturated fatty acids, which account for 85.65% of all the fatty acids in the seed oil. Among these unsaturated fatty acids, 76.85% were monounsaturated fatty acids. It is reported that monounsaturated fatty acids may cover the skin barrier and act as permeability enhancers [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Accordingly, these fatty acids have been wildly used not only in cosmetology for daily care of the face and body but also in the acceleration of skin wound healing [
