<p class="p">The application of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> (Wu Huan Zi in Chinese) seed kernel for antimicrobial and skin care is recorded in Chinaâ€™s traditional pharmaceutical book, Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu in Mandarin) some 500 years ago. In 2015, Srinivasarao et al. found that the extract of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> exhibited antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> could be used as a potential source of natural antimicrobial treatment because it possessed strong antioxidant potential [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, in their report, the extract was from whole 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> fruit; thus, it is difficult to know whether the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects were from the pericarp or the seed kernel. Recent studies indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> oil has abundant phytosterols and arachidonic acid (23.85%) [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. It is reported that phytosterols have an anti-inflammatory effect on skin and are capable of reducing swelling and erythema [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Additionally, arachidonic acid is not only an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid in the skin [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] but also plays an important role in reducing skin inflammation [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Since 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed extract contains anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant compounds, it could serve as a potential treatment for skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. However, the direct topical application of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil on the skin has not yet been well investigated. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to test the pharmacological effects of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil on skin wound healing in both in vivo and in vitro experiments.
