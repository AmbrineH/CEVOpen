<p class="p">It is well known that many seed oils have therapeutic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on the skin and promote wound healing and repair of skin [

 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In 2014, Pai et al. tested the n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. trifoliatus</italic> seeds and found that the seed extracts exhibited significant antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activities, and revealed benefits for skin wound healing [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, because 
 <italic class="italic">S. trifoliatus</italic> seed extract contains cyanolipids, which is irritating or toxic to human skin [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], the pharmacological benefits are limited. Since the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> oil is very similar to that of 
 <italic class="italic">S. trifoliatus</italic> oil [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] but without the toxic cyanolipids [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], it is reasonable to hypothesize that the oil extract of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed kernel could provide similar pharmaceutical effects without the adverse effect of cyanolipid.
