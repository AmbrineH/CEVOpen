<p class="p">Although various medicinal plant oils are used to treat different kinds of wounds, the scientific evidence about whether 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil also provides benefits for skin wound healing is incomplete. The present investigation, for the first time, indicates that 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil extract shows remarkable antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cell proliferation, cell migration stimulation, and skin wound healing. The total amount of δ-tocopherol and β-sitosterol in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil was 73.9 ± 23.6 μg/mL and 232.64 ± 4.5 μg/mL, respectively. The inhibition effect of 1% 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil on 
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was 99%. Addition of 500 μg/mL 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil resulted in a reduction of NO release by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 cells to 46%. The wound size of the oil-treated rats decreased significantly to almost 50% when 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil rich membrane was used as a dressing material. In accordance with our results, we suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil has the potential for development to promote skin wound healing. Since the use of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil involves a strategy of using a waste as source of bioactive compounds, it can conduct a cost benefit for skin care applications.
