<p class="p">HPLC was performed to determine the content of β-sitosterol and δ-tocopherol in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil. The HPLC was equipped with a low-pressure mixing pump (L2130, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), controlled by a CBM-20A interface module (Shimadzu Technology, Kyoto, Japan), and had a UV detector (Waters 486, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, US). The separation was achieved using a Mightysil RP-18 GP (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., Mightysil RP 18 GP Cica, Tokyo, Japan) at 30 °C. For the β-sitosterol analysis, the mobile phase consisted of 96% methanol, 3% tetrahydrofuran, and 1% deionized water. For δ-tocopherol detection, pure methanol was used as the mobile phase. For testing the two molecules, 20 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil were injected. The flow rates for the detection of β-sitosterol and δ-tocopherol were 0.5 mL/min and 0.5 mL/min, respectively. All the samples were monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm. The compounds were identified by comparing their retention times to those of authentic standards. The quantification was achieved using linear regression analysis.
