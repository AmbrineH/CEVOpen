<p class="p">For the GC-MS analysis, the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed-extracted oil was transesterified to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Briefly, 20 mg of extracted oil was mixed with 1 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide to act as a catalyst. The mixture was then stirred vigorously using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature for 30 s. Then, for saponification, the mix was maintained at 80 °C for 15 min. Then, 1 mL of boron trifluoride in a methanol solution was added to the sample, and the mixture was shaken for 30 s. The mixture was then placed in a 110 °C dry bath for 15 min. After the sample had returned to room temperature, 1 mL of n-hexane was added to the solution. The polar layer was separated and used to inject into the GC-MS system (GCMS-QP2010, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan).
