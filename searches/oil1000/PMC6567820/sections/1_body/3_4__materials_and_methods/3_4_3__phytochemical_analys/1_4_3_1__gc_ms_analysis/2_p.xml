<p class="p">A BPX70 capillary column with a dimension of 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. (0.25 μm film thickness) was used for oil composition separation. Helium was used as carrier gas at a pressure of 75 kPa. The sample was injected at a temperature set at 250 °C. The programmed temperature of the oven started at 120 °C and was held for 0.5 min for solvent delay, then increased at a rate of 10 °C/min to 180 °C, and then increased at a rate of 3 °C/min to 220 °C, followed by an increase of 30 °C/min to 260 °C and then, held for 5 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The temperature of the ionization chamber was set at 200 °C. For identification of the analyzed constituents with various retention times, a library search of mass spectra was performed using NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library.</p>
