<p class="p">The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil on cell migration behavior and wounded healing activity was assessed using scratch tests. Before the test, 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL CCD-966SK cells were cultured in 6-well Petri dishes and incubated in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37 °C and 100% humidity. When the cells reached confluence, they were starved overnight. A 1000-μL pipette tip was used to create a wound across the center of the culture dish. The scratched cells were washed with fresh medium to remove any loose or dead cells followed by exposure to 25 μg/mL 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil. Cells cultured with fresh medium but without oil served as a control group. For both groups, cell migration photographs were taken at 4× magnification using a bright-field illumination microscope (Eclipse TS100, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The images were captured by a digital camera (SPOT Idea, Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI, USA). The images were taken immediately (0 h) and after 6 and 12 h at five different sites from each wound area (gap). The captured images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) to evaluate the percentage of scratch closure, the percentage of gap closure was measured and compared with the results obtained before treatment (day 0) using the following formula [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">[(A
  <sub class="sub">0h</sub> − A
  <sub class="sub">Δh</sub>)/A
  <sub class="sub">0h</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub class="sub">0h</sub> is the scratch area at the beginning of the culture period, and A
 <sub class="sub">Δh</sub> is the scratch area after a certain culture period. The increase in the percentage of the closed area reflects the migration of cells.
