<p class="p">For testing the proliferation effect of the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil on skin cells, a cell viability assay was performed according to a previous study [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-20-02579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The human skin fibroblast cell line CCD-966SK (ATCC CRL-1881) was used for this in vitro cell analysis. The cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were then incubated in an environment of 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37 °C and 100% humidity. The viability of the CCD-966SK cells exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil at a concentration of 200 μg/mL was evaluated after three days of incubation. The cell viability was assessed using the tetrazolium salt (MTT) method. After the cells were incubated with the tetrazolium salt for 4 h, 500 μL of DMSO were added to solubilize the formazan dye overnight. Since no toxic effects were observed on the cells, the emulsifier polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate (Tween 80) was employed as the delivery vehicle [
