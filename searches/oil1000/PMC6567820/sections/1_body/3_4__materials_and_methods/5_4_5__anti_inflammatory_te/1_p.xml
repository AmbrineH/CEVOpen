<p class="p">To test the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil, we assessed the oil in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a concentration of 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were cultured in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. After pre-incubation of the cells for 24 h, cells were pretreated with the 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil with a series of concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 μg/mL for 1 h and were further stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) from 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> strain 055:B5 for 24 h. 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-nitro-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-arginine-methyl ester (
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-NAME) at a concentration 1 mM was used as a positive control. The NO concentration produced by the RAW 264.7 cells was determined through the Griess assay. Briefly, an equal volume of Griess reagent was mixed with the culture supernatant, and color development was measured at 530 nm using a microplate reader (EZ Read 400, Biochrom, Holliston, MA, USA). Anti-inflammatory activity was presented in terms of NO production percentage.
