<p class="p">Eight SD rats were randomly divided into two groups. For the tested group, the wound sites of the rats were covered with the prepared oil-hydrogel and were wrapped with porous bandages. The oil-free hydrogel was applied to the wounds of the control animals. The covered hydrogel was replaced every two days during the 12-day experiment. The rats were housed individually after wounding. For the evaluation of the progressive change in the wounded area, the wounds were photographed every two days with a digital camera. The wound area was measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The wound area was determined by measuring the mass of the transparent paper cut to the shape of the wound. The wound contraction was expressed as a percentage reduction of the original cut size. The percentages of wound size were determined by calculating the ratio between the measured wound area and the original wound area.</p>
