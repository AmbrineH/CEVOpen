 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil. The ratio of the CMC, HA, and SA in the hydrogels was 1:3:12. Before the study, the rats’ backs were one-way clipped (5 × 5 cm) with an electric animal shaver and the disinfected with 75% alcohol. Then, the rats were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in an induction chamber. Before the experiment, one linear wound with an area of 2 × 2 cm was made by excising the skin on the back of the rat using sterile scissors.
