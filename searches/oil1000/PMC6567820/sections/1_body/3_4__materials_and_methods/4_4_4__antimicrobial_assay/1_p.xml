<p class="p">The antimicrobial effects of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mukorossi</italic> seed oil were tested in this study. The procedure was modified from the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS Z 2801:2000. Several microorganisms (Bioresource Collection and Research Center, BCRC, Hsinchu, Taiwan) including two bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">P. acnes</italic>; ATCC 11827 and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>; ATCC 6538P) and a fungus (
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>; ATCC 10231) that cause skin diseases. All selected microbes were cultured in their standard culture medium. For testing the antimicrobial activity of the oil, 0.1 mL oil was mixed and inoculated with 10 mL of each microorganism culture to a concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL at 25 °C for 24 h. After serial dilution, the three bacteria were swabbed uniformly across the agar surface of Petri plates. After 48 h incubation at 23 °C for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> or 37 °C for the bacteria, the number of colonies on each plate was counted. 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Inactivation rate (%) = [1 – (CFU
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub>/CFU
  <sub class="sub">control</sub>)] × 100
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where CFU
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> and CFU
 <sub class="sub">control</sub> are the colony numbers of the tested and control samples, respectively.
