 <bold class="bold">Results:</bold> Five weeks treatment with glucose led to increases in systolic blood pressure, plasma glucose and insulin levels and insulin resistance index in association with a rise in superoxide anion production and NADPH oxidase activity (sensitive to diphenyleneiodonium) in the aorta. The simultaneous treatment with argan oil prevented or significantly reduced all those effects, yet the same treatment with corn oil had a positive impact only on hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.
