 <bold class="bold">Methods:</bold> Sprague-Dawley rats had free access to a drinking solution containing 10% D-glucose or tap water (control) for 5 weeks. The impact of argan oil was compared to that of corn oil given daily by gavage (5 mL/kg) during 5 weeks in glucose-fed rats. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the superoxide anion production and the NADPH oxidase activity using the lucigenin method.
