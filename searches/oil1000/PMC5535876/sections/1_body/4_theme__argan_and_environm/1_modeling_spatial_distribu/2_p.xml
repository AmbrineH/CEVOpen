<p class="p">Argan trees (
 <italic class="italic">Argania spinosa</italic>) provide many functions and ecosystem services and are an important source of income for local people. The main source of income results from fruit production from which a highly valuable oil is extracted. Current production of oil exceeds 4000 T/year. Most of the Argan populations are located in regions characterized by water scarcity and vulnerability to desertification and that will strongly be impacted by climate change. As a result, the impact on the future Argan distribution in response to climate change should be assessed. Such understanding is valuable for prioritizing short and long-term management efforts, and is very useful for supporting decisions in order to ensure a sustainable production of Argan oil.
