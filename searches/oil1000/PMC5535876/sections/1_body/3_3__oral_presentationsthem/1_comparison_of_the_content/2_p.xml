<p class="p">The beneficial activities of vegetable oils results from their components. Thus, we intended to compare phytosterols, fatty acids, tocopherols, and polyphenols contents of dietary and cosmetic argan oil (AO), olive oil (OO; Tunisia, Morocco and Spain), silybum marianum seed oils (SMSO; Zaghouane, Bizerte, Sousse), nigella seed oil (NSO) and colza oil (CO), using analytical methods. The antioxidant potential of the oils was evaluated with KRL test. Oils had high C18:2 contents, with highest amounts in SMSO and NSO. CO had the highest amount of C18:3. Its level was eight to ten folds higher in NSO compared to the AO and SMSO. OO and AO had the highest level of C18:1. OO had the highest level of C16:0. C22:0 and C24:0 were found with elevated amounts in SMSO. CO and Berkane AO were rich in γ-tocopherol. Agadir AO contained the highest amount of α-tocopherol, which was present in an appreciable level in SMSO Zaghouan and Tunisian OO. Phytosterols profile showed that β-sitosterol was the major sterol in all the oils in the exception of AO. Spinasterol and schotenol were present in an important amounts in AO. Schotenol was also detected with highest level in SMSO. Stigmasterol, ∆7 campesterol, β amyrine were detected especially, in SMSO. Polyphenol profile showed the presence of homovanillic acid, vanillin, p-Coumaric acid, quercetine-3β-glucoside, quercetin and apigenin in SMSO. In AO, only protocatechic acid and tyrosol were identified. In NSO, 2.6-dihydroxybenzoïc acid, thymoquinone homovanillic acid, vanillin were detected. The antioxidant ability of the oils showed that CO, Sousse SMSO and dietary Agadir AO had the highest Red blood cells half-hemolysis time in min, which reflect their ability to increase resistance of the cells to hemolysis. The antioxidant ability of dietary and cosmetic Berkane AO was positively correlated to procatechic acid and compestanol levels. The above-mentioned makes AO and SMSO preferable choice for diseases preventing diets.</p>
