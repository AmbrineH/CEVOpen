<p class="p">Medicinal plants constitute an important reservoir of active and new biomolecules and wide variety of secondary metabolites. The obtaining of reproducible and reliable extracts ensures the reproducibility of the pharmacological activity. Chromatography fingerprinting is an elegant approach to monitoring the compounds involved.We develop TLC fingerprint to evaluate the chemical stability and identifies biomolecules of the extract before screening pharmacological activity. The TLC fingerprint is constructed from the spots and the area of the compounds by software.</p>
