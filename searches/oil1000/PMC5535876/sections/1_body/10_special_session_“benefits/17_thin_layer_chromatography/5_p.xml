<p class="p">In our previous studies differential extraction shows four stable compounds. Three flavonoids (Mtb1, Mtb2 Mtb3) were identified and Tpn is probably a terpene. In this research we are focused on polar fraction for antibacterial and antihypertensive screening. This TLC fingerprint is used in first step for preparative chromatography of polar fraction. The first results show promising pharmacological activity.</p>
