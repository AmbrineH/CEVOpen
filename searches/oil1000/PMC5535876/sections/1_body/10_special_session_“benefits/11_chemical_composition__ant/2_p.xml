<p class="p">Medicinal and aromatic plants have been used for a long time in the process of oxidative stress and the fight against infectious diseases. But the discovery of synthetic antioxidants and antibiotics caused the decline of herbal medicine and relegated it to a secondary rank. In effect, the secondary effects of these synthetic products and the appearance of resistant bacteria led us to study the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the essential oil of leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Tetraclinis articulata (vahl) Masters</italic>. Extraction of the essential oils was carried out by hydrodistillation. The composition of the essential oil was analyzed by GC/MS. We used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the essential oil the radical ABTS and the radical DPPH. While the antibacterial activity was determinate by paper disc diffusion method and the liquid dilution method. The test microorganisms include Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria which are clinical isolates. The main constituents of the essential oil were Camphor (24.21%), Î±-Pinene (23.77%), Bornyl Acetate (17.37%) and Borneol (10.32%). The results of the biological tests show that the essential oil of the leaves of Tetraclinis articulata has interesting antibacterial and antioxidant properties. This study confirms scientifically the traditional use of this plant and reveals its interest in the context of exploitation in biotechnology.
