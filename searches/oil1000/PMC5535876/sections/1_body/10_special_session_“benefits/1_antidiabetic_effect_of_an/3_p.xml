<p class="p">In normal rats, a single administration of the A.P.A.E (5 mg/kg) has not shown a significant reduction in blood glucose levels. However, a significant reduction (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and STZ diabetics (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) rats. The blood glucose lowering activity of A.P.A.E was comparable to vanadate treatment at a dose used. The oral glucose tolerance test demonstrated the ability of the aqueous extract of A.P.A.E (5 mg/kg) to improve the increase on blood glucose levels in normal treated rats. In this investigation no significant changes in body weight in normal and STZ rats were shown. According to the DPPH (1-1-diphenyl 2-picryl hydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, the aqueous extract has shown a not negligible antioxidant activity.
