<p class="p">Throughout the world and especially in developing countries, the interest in pseudocereals has increased for both consumers and small businesses. Recent studies strongly suggest that non-essential nutrients like phytochemicals of pseudocereals can also have potential health beneficial effects. This fact has promoted different processing techniques that may enhance the biological value of pseudocereals. Despite the important nutritional and functional value of these grains, their commercialization is still quite limited. Lactic acid fermentation is an ancestral process of food preservation but with renewed interest over time. It has become an important strategy to exploit the bioactive potential of pseudocereals by hydrolysing anti-nutrients factors and increasing the level of health beneficial compounds. The multiple beneficial effects of pseudocereals fermented by selected LAB can be exploited in different ways leading to the design of novel plant-based foods that can target specific populations.</p>
