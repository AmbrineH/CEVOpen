<p class="p">The aim of this review is to highlight certain nutritional and functional properties of pseudocereals and how lactic acid fermentation can be used as an advantageous biotechnological strategy to improve the natural potential of these grains. This review provides an overview on pseudocereal fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) emphasizing the capacity of these bacteria to decrease antinutritional factors such as phytic acid, increase the functional value of phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, and produce nutritional ingredients such as B-group vitamins.</p>
