<p class="p">According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global hunger is in ascent again after constantly decreasing for over a decade (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>). The number of chronically undernourished people in the world is estimated to have increased to 815 million (11% of the global population) in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015, as reported in the edition of the Annual United Nations on World Food Security and Nutrition published in September 2017, based on reports by five organizations [ONU, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), WHO (World Health Organization), IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and World Food Program (WFP)] (

Nearly 795 million people have eating disorders and do not carry out healthy and active lifestyles with an estimated 41 million children that are now overweight according to the World Food Program. Added to this serious situation, the world population is expected to reach nine billion persons in the coming decades, imposing the need for urgent solutions to increase food supplies (

In addition, climate change is rapidly degrading the conditions of crop production, affecting the availability of water and arable land, increasing salinization and aridity, generating a serious problem in the yield of food. It is estimated that approximately one billion hectares or crop land will be affected worldwide due to these problems, especially those in the hottest and most arid regions of the world (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>) also reported that modern agriculture generates serious problems in the environment causing soil degradation and erosion, water pollution and biodiversity decline. Therefore, it is essential to increase food production for a growing population that uses low input regimes. The FAO urges to expand the response to climate change in agriculture. According to their 2017 document “A systemic approach that involves the relevant agricultural and food sectors and those interested in the adoption of agroecology, has the potential to greatly accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient food systems, in line with the various international commitments assumed by the member countries.” Agroecology, in an integral manner, can support the execution of different social, economic, environmental, nutritional, and health objectives.
