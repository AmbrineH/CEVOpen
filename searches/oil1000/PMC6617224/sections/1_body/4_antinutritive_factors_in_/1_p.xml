<p class="p">Grains of cereals, pseudocereals, and legumes are of global importance in the feeding of monogastric animals (humans and domestic animals) since they are a good source of proteins, bioactive compounds and trace elements (

 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>). In this sense the bioavailability of minerals in whole grain foods is negatively affected by the presence of phytate (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>). Since phytate is an antinutritional factor that is found in the highest quantities in pseudocereals and due to its important negative effect on malnutrition, this review will focus on this antinutritive factor.
