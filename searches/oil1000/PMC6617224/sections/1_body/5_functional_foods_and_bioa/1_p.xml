<p class="p">The demand of consumers for healthier foods has led the food industry to formulate new products within the area of so-called functional foods. Functional foods were defined by Bech-Larsen and Grunert (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>) as “Foods that may provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition” and “Food similar in appearance to conventional food that is intended to be consumed as part of a normal diet, but has been modified to subserve physiological roles beyond the provision of simple nutrient requirements.” According to these definitions, certain fruits and vegetables, rich in fiber and bioactive phytochemicals, can be considered functional products. Bioactive compounds are phytochemicals present in plants that can promote health but are not essential for life (

 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>). The key bioactive components of whole grain cereals provide health benefits, principally due to their content of flavonoid and dietary fiber. The covalent interactions between these two components increase their individual anti-inflammatory effects and their positive impact on the gut microbiome (

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>). In addition to their exceptional nutritional value, pseudocereals are characterized for being rich in many “health-promoting” phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and dietary fiber which exhibit anti-oxidant and free-radical scavenging activity (

 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>). Amaranth oil has high levels of tocotrienols and squalene, which are involved in the cholesterol metabolism and could play a significant role in lowering the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)—cholesterol in blood (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>). Also, dietary fiber and polyphenols intake has been associated with reduced risk for a number of cardiovascular diseases including stroke, hypertension, and heart disease (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>). Pasko et al. (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>) reported that the supplementation of a fructose-containing diet with quinoa in male Wistar rats reduced serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, LDL and plasma total protein and suggests the potential ability of this pseudocereal to prevent cardiovascular disease.
