 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>) reported that 73% of the total world harvested area corresponds to cereal crops and contributes to more than 60% of the world food production, furnishing proteins, minerals, dietary fiber, and vitamins necessary for human health. Cereals contribute around 50% of the mean daily energy intake in most populations, and 70% in some developing countries, converting them into one of the most important sources of energy in the world (

However, most grains are, to a greater or lesser extent, deficient in a number of elemental nutrients such as the essential amino acids threonine, lysine, and tryptophan. Their protein digestibility is also lower than that of animal origin, due partially to the presence of phytic acid, tannins, and polyphenols which bind to protein thus making them indigestible (

The FAO classified quinoa as one of humanity's promising crops destined to contribute to food security in the twenty-first century by its high nutritive potential and genetic diversity [Food and Agriculture Organization Regional Office for Latin America and PROINPA, (

Quinoa and amaranth have tender leaves that are used in food preparation; however, it is their grains that attract the most interest due to their high nutritional value. They are rich in proteins of excellent quality with a balanced essential amino acid composition that include abundant amounts of sulfur- rich amino acids (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>). They are also a good source of minerals (calcium, iron and zinc), vitamins, and natural antioxidants (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>). They are a significant source of compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols and phytosterols with potential nutraceutical benefits. From a food provision perspective, pseudocereals are potentially important crops due to their properties (exceptional nutritional value, ability to grow in dry conditions, and their resilience to climatic conditions). Several reviews have reported the nutritional value of Andean grains (
