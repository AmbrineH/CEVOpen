<p class="p">Pseudocereals are important phytochemical sources in the diet. Like cereal, these grains contain a great amount of functional phytochemicals including the phenolic compounds (PC) (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>). The PC constitute a group of secondary metabolites with important functions in cereals and pseudocereals. The chemical structures of these compounds include an aromatic ring with one or more hydroxyl substituents, and vary from simple phenolic molecules to highly polymerised compounds (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>). PC are broadly divided in four classes; phenolic acids (benzoic or hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives), flavonoids (flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavanones, and anthocyanidins), stilbenes and lignans. In addition to this diversity, polyphenols may be associated with various carbohydrates and organic acids (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric, caffeic, isoferulic, vanillic, sinapic, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, syringic, and protocatechuic acids are present in all grains; with ferulic acid the most abundant phenolic acid (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>) reported a high content of polyphenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids in pseudocereals such as buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth. Likewise, the highest amount of PC was reported in quinoa (490.2 mg/kg DW), slightly lower in amaranth v. Aztek (464 mg/kg DW), and the lowest in amaranth v. Rawa (424.6 mg/kg DW) (
