<p class="p">The biological effects of PC depend principally on their bioaccessibility (release of the food matrix in an absorbable form during digestion) and bioavailability (absorption and transference to the bloodstream), and both depend on their chemical structure, matrix interactions, antioxidant activity, and food processing (
