The dietary PC contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut by modulating the gut microbial balance (beneficial bacteria/pathogen bacteria). Metagenomic and metabolomic studies providing more insight into the health effects of PC in humans are needed to understand the dietary PC/gut microbiota relationship and their mechanisms of action. The PC effect on the modulation of the gut ecology and the two-way relationship “polyphenols ↔ microbiota” is currently being studied (
