<p class="p">Vitamins are essential micronutrients since only small quantities are required for adequate growth and function of numerous metabolic reactions. Vitamins are divided based on their solubility in fat (A, D, E, and K), or in water (C and the B-group vitamins). Since there are no foods that contain all vitamins, there is a worldwide increase in their deficiencies due to unbalanced diets. Other causes of vitamin deficiencies are malabsorption that can be due to certain drug treatments or diseases, by the presence of antinutritional factors found in certain foods. Although most vitamins are present in cereals and pseudocereals, a large portion of water-soluble vitamins are lost during processing and cooking, especially when water is used for grain soaking. In this sense, many countries have adopted mandatory fortification programs with specific vitamins and minerals. Folic acid is frequently added in foods of mass consumption (such as different flours) in order to prevent deficiencies in the general population. However, the chemical form of the vitamin used in these programs is controversial. Folic acid, a chemical derivative of folates, is not found in nature and can cause many side effects, especially masking vitamin B

Natural folate, present in numerous different chemical forms in vegetables or produced by certain microorganisms does not cause these undesirable side effects. For this reason, more and more researchers are now searching for more natural methods to increase water soluble vitamins such as folate and riboflavin in foods to not only prevent deficiencies, but also to reduce the use of chemical additives in the food chain.
