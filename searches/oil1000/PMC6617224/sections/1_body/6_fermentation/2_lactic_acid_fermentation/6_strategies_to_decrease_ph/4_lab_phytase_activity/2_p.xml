 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">247</xref>) reviewed the contributions of recombinant technology to phytase research during the last decade with specific emphasis on new generation phytases. These results are relevant in the design of new functional foods with improved nutritional quality by using food-grade strains expressing microbial phytases.
