<p class="p">One strategy to reduce phytate in cereals/pseudocereals includes treatments, such as soaking and malting (

 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">234</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">235</xref>), that activate phytases present in plants (
 <xref rid="B236" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">236</xref>). However, this activity is considered insufficient to eliminate the phytate present in these substrates (
 <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">237</xref>). Recent research has shown that microbial sources are more promising for the production of phytases on a commercial level and in cereal based foods (
