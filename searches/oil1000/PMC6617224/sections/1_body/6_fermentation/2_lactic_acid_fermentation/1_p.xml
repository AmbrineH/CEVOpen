<p class="p">Lactic acid bacteria are Gram positive, non-sporulating, cytochrome deficient, catalase negative, aerotolerant, fastidious, acid-tolerant, and strictly fermentative microorganisms, produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation (

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>). The effective carbohydrate fermentation coupled to substrate-level phosphorylation is essential characteristic of LAB; the ATP produced is then employed for biosynthetic functions. LAB are generally related with habitats rich in nutrients, for example different foods (milk, beverages, vegetables, meat, cereals); however, some LAB are members of normal flora of the intestine, mouth, and vagina of mammals (
