<p class="p">The pseudocereals (i.e., buckwheat and quinoa) have a higher content of flavonoids, mainly rutine, kaempferol, and quercetin, with respect to cereals such as rye and wheat (

 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>). The flavonoid aglycones are more potent in their functional action (i.e., antioxidant activity) than their corresponding glycosides. Shin et al. (
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>) showed that a strain of 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus avium</italic> was able to metabolize rutine, a flavonol glycoside, in quercetin, a flavonol with many beneficial effects on health. Recently, Zielinski et al. (
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>) observed a decrease in rutin content in buckwheat flours fermented by different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>. According to Yang et al. (
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">207</xref>), quercetin has numerous biological and pharmacological effects, such as anticancer, antioxidative, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activities. Fan et al. (
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">208</xref>) reported the inhibition mechanism of quercetin on tyrosinase (rate-limiting enzyme in the melanogenesis pathway) and its potential use in the treatment of pigmentation disorders. In addition, Xiao (
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>) reviewed different biological benefits and pharmacokinetic behaviors between flavonoid glycosides and their aglycones. The elucidation of the metabolic pathways of these compounds will lead to obtain strains resistant to PC or adequate enzymes for cereals/pseudocereals processing and products with higher functional values, such as antioxidants.
