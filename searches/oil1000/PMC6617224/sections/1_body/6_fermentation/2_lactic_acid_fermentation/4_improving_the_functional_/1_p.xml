<p class="p">Numerous commercial microbial enzymes have been used to increase the functional value of phytochemicals present in plant sources however, lactic acid fermentation is preferred to improve the nutraceutical value of these foods because it is relatively inexpensive and improve overall organoleptic and nutritional characteristics (

 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>). In addition, the incidence of certain chemical and physical parameters, such as the lack of fermentable carbohydrates, osmotic stress, and the acidic environment, are adverse conditions for bacterial growth. However, several LAB can adapt and grow in these substrates, being

The adaptation and survival strategies of LAB during cereal fermentation by activation of specific metabolic pathways have been investigated through a panel of various interacting omics approaches (metabolomic, phenomic, and transcriptomic profile) (

 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>). The study of these adaptation responses would allow the optimal design of fermentation strategies for cereals and others plant matrices; however, these “omics” studies were not reported in pseudocereals fermentation.
