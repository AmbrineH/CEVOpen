<p class="p">LAB and other vitamin-producing microorganisms can be used as an alternative to mandatory fortification in many countries to reduce deficiencies. Some LAB strains can produce elevated concentrations of the natural form of vitamins, which reduces the side-effects of chemically synthesized vitamins (masking of vitamin B

Besides being a more natural alternative, vitamins producing LAB can also lower production costs by eliminating the need to add synthetic vitamins. The search for natural LAB strains from different ecological niches that can produce vitamins, such as folate, is essential in order to produce novel fermented foods that have high concentrations of this vitamin (
