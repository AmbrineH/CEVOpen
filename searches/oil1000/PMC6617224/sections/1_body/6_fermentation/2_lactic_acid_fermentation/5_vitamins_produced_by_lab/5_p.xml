<p class="p">Russo et al. (
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">225</xref>) reported that 
 <italic class="italic">L. fermentum</italic> PBCC11 isolated from sourdough was able to produce riboflavin. Bread produced using the co-inoculum yeast and 
 <italic class="italic">L. fermentum</italic> PBCC11.5 led to an approximately 2-fold increase of final vitamin B
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content compared to the wild-type strain (
 <italic class="italic">L. fermentum</italic> PBCC11). It was also reported that some LAB strains that are able to produce pseudo-vitamin B
 <sub class="sub">12</sub> could also be used to increase the concentrations in cereal-based foods (
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">226</xref>). These authors stated that the first pseudo-cobalamin producing strain of LAB was 
 <italic class="italic">L. reuteri</italic> CRL 1098 that was isolated from sourdough (
 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">227</xref>). It has been suggested that the pseudo-cobalamin produced by LAB would not be biologically available since the intrinsic factor has a low affinity for this compound (
 <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">228</xref>). However, it has been shown that soy fermented with this strain was able to prevent vitamin B
 <sub class="sub">12</sub> deficiency in mice (
 <xref rid="B229" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">229</xref>), demonstrating that pseudo cobalamins are bioavailable. The analysis of sequenced genomes of LAB will provide more insights and new potential candidates that could be used to ferment cereal-based foods.
