<p class="p">LAB diversity is interesting not only at a species level, but also at the strain level, since most technological and nutritional properties are strain dependent. Raw cereals/pseudocereals constitute an interesting ecological niche to isolate new LAB strains with important characteristics to be used as a starter culture in the preparation of fermented cereal food. It was shown that folate producing LAB were isolated from wheat, sorghum and triticale (

 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>). In terms of vitamin-producing strains in pseudocereals, it has been shown that certain strains of LAB isolated from quinoa and amaranth sourdough have the capacity to produce elevated concentrations of riboflavin and folate in vitamin-free media (

 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>). These strains were used to obtain a B

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> bio enriched pasta, which was able to prevent and revert vitamin deficiency in different rodent models (
