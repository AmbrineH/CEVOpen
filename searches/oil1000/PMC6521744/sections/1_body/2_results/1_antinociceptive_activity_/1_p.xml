<p class="p">The antinociceptive activity of lavender essential oil (LEO) was evaluated against conditions of acute and persistent nociception and the modulation of the pain threshold was evaluated by applying a thermal (hot plate test) or a mechanical (von Frey’s test) stimulus. A dose-response study showed that LEO produced a dose-related antinociceptive activity against an acute thermal stimulus. The doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg were ineffective. Although not significant, the dose of 75 mg/kg slightly increased the pain threshold whereas the dose of 100 mg/kg reached a significant antinociceptive activity. No further increase was detected at higher doses (
