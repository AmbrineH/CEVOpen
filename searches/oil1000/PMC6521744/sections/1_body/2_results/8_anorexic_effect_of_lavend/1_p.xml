<p class="p">The feeding behavior of mice treated with LEO 100 mg/kg was evaluated in animals that were previously deprived of food for 4 h, an experimental condition suitable to highlight both an increase and a decrease in food consumption. In 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref> is illustrated the cumulative curve for the food eaten by mice. Control mice showed a progressive increase of food intake in 60 min. Similarly, LEO-treated progressively increased the food consumption, but the cumulative amount of food eaten over the 60-min period of the test was significantly lower than control group, showing an anorexic phenotype (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6A</xref>). The effect on feeding behavior disappeared 60 min after treatment, similar to what was observed for the antinociceptive activity.
