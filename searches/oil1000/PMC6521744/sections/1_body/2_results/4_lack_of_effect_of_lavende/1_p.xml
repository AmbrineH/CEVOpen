<p class="p">To investigate transcriptional mechanisms that promote iNOS expression, the activation of NF-κB in SNI mice was examined by immunoblotting experiments. Under basal conditions, NF-κB is inhibited by the inhibitory subunit IκBα. Following phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, NF-κB is released and translocates to the nucleus, promoting gene transcription. SNI mice showed a significant decrease of IκBα protein levels, indicating the degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory subunit, 7 days after surgery. However, LEO administration did not modify the IκBα levels indicating that it was unable to prevent the activation of the NF-κB pathway (
