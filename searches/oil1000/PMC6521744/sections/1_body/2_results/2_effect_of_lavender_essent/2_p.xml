<p class="p">Experiments performed in spinal cord samples from the ipsilateral side of SNI mice, collected 7 days after surgery, showed an increase in the phosphorylation of both ERK1 (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>) and ERK2 (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>) isoforms. This ERK1 and ERK2 over-phosphorylation was prevented by treatment with LEO 100 mg/kg.
