<p class="p">Lavender is one of the most popular essential oils used in aromatherapy. There are many different botanical species corresponding to the 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> genus but some of the species considered as medicinal are the following: 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, known as English lavender; 
 <italic class="italic">L. stoechas</italic>, known as French lavender; 
 <italic class="italic">L. latifolia</italic>, a Mediterranean grass-like lavender; and 
 <italic class="italic">L. intermedia</italic>, which is a sterile cross between 
 <italic class="italic">L. latifolia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. angustifolia</italic>. The various lavenders have almost identical traditional uses and a large similarity in the main chemical constituents (
