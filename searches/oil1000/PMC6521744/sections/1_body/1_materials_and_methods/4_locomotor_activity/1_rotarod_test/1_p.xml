<p class="p">Motor performance was evaluated using the rotarod test (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galeotti et al., 2003</xref>). The rotarod apparatus consisted of a 3-cm-diameter rod with a non-slippery surface at a rotation rate of 16 RPM. The rod, 30 cm in length, was placed at a height of 15 cm from the base and divided into 5 equal sections by 6 disks. The animal was placed back on the rod immediately after falling and the integrity of motor coordination was assessed as number of falls from the rod in 30 s.
