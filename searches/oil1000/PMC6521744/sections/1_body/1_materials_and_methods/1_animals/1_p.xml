<p class="p">Experiments were performed on male CD1 mice (weight: 22–24 g; Harlan Laboratories, Bresso, Italy). Mice were randomly housed in standard cages and kept in a room at 23 ± 1°C with a 12-h light/dark cycle, light on at 7 a.m. Food (standard laboratory diet) and tap water were available 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic>. The cages were placed in the experimental room 24 h before behavioral testing for acclimatization. All tests were conducted during the light phase. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institution’s Animal Care and Research Ethics Committee (University of Florence, Italy), under license from the Italian Department of Health (54/2014-B). Mice were treated in accordance with the relevant European Union (Directive 2010/63/EU, the council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes) and international regulations (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, US National Research Council, 2011). All studies involving animals are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for experiments involving animals (
