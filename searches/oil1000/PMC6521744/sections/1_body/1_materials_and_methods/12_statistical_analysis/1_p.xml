<p class="p">Data are expressed as the mean ± s.e.mean. For Western blotting assays, data are mean of four individual experiments conducted in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test, one-way ANOVA (followed by Tukey’s test for 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> comparison) or two-way ANOVA (followed by Bonferroni test for 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> analysis). Mean differences with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To conduct statistical analyses, the computer program GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used.
