<p class="p">The hot plate test was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sanna et al., 2015</xref>). Mice were placed on a hot plate (Ugo Basile Biological Research Apparatus, Varese, Italy), with the temperature adjusted to 52.5 ± 0.1°C. Reaction latencies (s) were measured with a stopwatch before (baseline latency) and after treatments. The time to the first sign of nociception (paw licking) was recorded and the mouse immediately removed from the hot plate. An arbitrary cutoff period of 45s was adopted to avoid damage to the paws.
