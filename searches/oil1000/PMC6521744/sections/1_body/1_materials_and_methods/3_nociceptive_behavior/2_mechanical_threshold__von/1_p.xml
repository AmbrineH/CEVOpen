<p class="p">Mechanical allodynia was measured by using a Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, Bologna, Italy) as previously described (
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sanna et al., 2015</xref>). The mice were placed in individual Plexiglas chambers [8.5 × 3.4 × 3.4 (h) cm] on a wire-mesh grid floor and an adaptation period of approximately 1 h was allowed, during which exploratory and grooming activity ended. After that, a mechanical stimulus was delivered to the plantar surface of the hind paw of the mouse, using an automated transducer filament. A steel rod (2 mm) was pushed with electronic ascending force (0–5 g in 35 s). The pain threshold was defined as the amount of pressure, recorded to the nearest 0.1 g, that induced a flexor response and was determined by three repeated challenges at 10-min intervals. The averages of responses were calculated. Nociceptive response for mechanical sensitivity was expressed as paw withdrawal threshold (g) and both ipsilateral (operated) and contralateral (unoperated) hind paws were tested.
