<p class="p">The tail suspension test was performed according to 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galeotti and Ghelardini (2012)</xref>. Mice were suspended from a plastic rod mounted 50 cm above the floor by adhesive tape placed to the upper middle of the tail. The time during which mice remained immobile was measured with a stopwatch during a test period of 6 min. Mice were considered immobile when they hung passively and completely motionless, except movements caused by respiration. Immobility was considered as depression-like behavior (behavioral despair) and was measured in the first 2 min of the test, when animals react to the unavoidable stress, and in the last 4 min, when the behavioral despair is established.
