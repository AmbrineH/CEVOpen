<p class="p">Memory-related responses were measured using the novel object recognition test (NORT), which is based on natural exploratory activity of mice. NORT evaluates the rodent’s ability to recognize a novel object in the environment and measures a form of recognition memory (
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Okamura et al., 2011</xref>). To perform the NORT, an open field device (cylinder diameter: 78 cm, height walls: 60 cm) was used. Mice were allowed to explore the open field. No object was placed in the box during the habituation session. Then, in the first session (training phase), animals were placed in the middle of the arena and presented with two identical objects (A1 and A2), placed 16 cm from the wall and 37 cm apart, for 5 min. Object exploration was measured manually using a stopwatch by an experienced observer blind to drug treatment. Exploration was defined as sniffing or touching the object with the nose or mouth. To measure short-term memory or long-term memory, the animals were placed back in the open field after 3-h or 24-h delay in the home cage, respectively, and presented with two objects, the familiar A1 (the same as the training phase) and a novel object B for 5 min (test phase). The objects were always placed in the same location. To secure the objects in place, Velcro into the base of the objects was used. Objects A1 and B had different shapes, colors, and sizes that had no significance for animals. The objects and the apparatus were cleaned with ethanol solution between trials to remove the olfactory cues. The test phase reflects the preference for the novel object. Recognition index for the novel object was calculated (TN-TF/TN + TF) × 100 (TF = time spent exploring familiar object; TN = time spent exploring the novel object). During the training session, both objects are novel and the time spent on both objects should be similar.
