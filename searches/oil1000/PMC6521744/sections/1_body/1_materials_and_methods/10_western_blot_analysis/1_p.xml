<p class="p">Membrane homogenates (20–50 μg) were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The resolved proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (120 min at 100 V) using standard procedures. Membranes were blocked in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 120 min and then rinsed three times in Washing Buffer for 5 min each. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with specific antibodies against ERK1/2 (1:1,000); ERK/1/2 phosphorylated on Thr202/Tyr204

The blots were rinsed thrice in PBS containing 0.1% Tween and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera (1:10,000) and left for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then extensively rinsed, followed by visualization using chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce, Milan, Italy) and signal intensity (pixels/mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) quantified (ImageJ, NIH). Original blots are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. Exposition and developing time used was standardized for all the blots. For each sample, the signal intensity was normalized to that of ß-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), used as loading control for protein expression, and the expression level of the proteins is an average of the densities per band area from each group.
