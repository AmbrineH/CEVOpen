<p class="p">iNOS is under the transcriptional control of several transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kleinert et al., 2004</xref>). In the nervous system, NF-κB consists of homo- and heterodimers (p50/p65). Under basal conditions, NF-κB is mainly located within the cytoplasm and is complexed to the inhibitory subunit (IκB), keeping NF-κB in an inactive state. Following specific stimuli, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded. This process releases NF-κB and promotes its translocation from cytosol to the nucleus to modulate the expression of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory genes (

NF-κB triggers a self-perpetuating process resulting, progressively, in neuropathic pain and many small molecules have been reported to provide protection against neuropathic pain by blocking the NF-κB signaling (
