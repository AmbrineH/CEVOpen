 <p> Effect of LEO on iNOS and NF-kB in the spinal cord of SNI mice. LEO (100 mg/kg p.o.) prevented the increased expression of iNOS (A) induced by SNI 7 days after surgery (One-way ANOVA, F(2,17) = 133.30, p &lt; 0.0001). (B) Lack of effect of LEO on Ik-Balpha decreased expression (One-way ANOVA, F(2,17) = 12.27, p &lt; 0.001). Representative blots were reported in each panel. ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001 vs. sham-operated control group. °°° p &lt; 0.001 vs. SNI. </p>
