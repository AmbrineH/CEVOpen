 <p> Effect of LEO on MAPK phosphorylation in the spinal cord of SNI mice. LEO (100 mg/kg p.o.) prevented the increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1 (one-way ANOVA, F(2,17) = 31.07, p &lt; 0.0001) (A), ERK2 (one-way ANOVA, F(2,17) = 30.81, p &lt; 0.0001) (B), and JNK1 (one-way ANOVA, F(2,17) = 9.80, p &lt; 0.001) (C) induced by SNI 7 days after surgery. (D) Lack of effect of LEO on P38 increased phosphorylation (one-way ANOVA, F(2,17) = 23.73, p &lt; 0.0001). Representative blots were reported in each panel. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001 vs. sham-operated control group. ° p &lt; 0.05, °°° p &lt; 0.001 vs. SNI. </p>
