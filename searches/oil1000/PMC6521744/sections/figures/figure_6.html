 <p> Effect of LEO on feeding and locomotor behaviour. (A) The food consumption was evaluated as the cumulated amount of food eaten over a 60-min period in 4 h food-deprived mice. LEO (100 mg/kg p.o.) significantly decreased food consumption 30 min after administration. (two-way ANOVA, treatment F(1,48) 16.72 p &lt; 0.001; time F(2,48) 32.07 p &lt; 0.0001); * p &lt; 0.05 in comparison with control mice. Lack of impairment of motor coordination (B), spontaneous mobility (C), and exploratory activity (D) in mice treated with LEO. </p>
