   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> In the training session of the novel object recognition test (NORT), no difference between exploration times was measured. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> In the retention test, the exploration time of the familiar object was reduced in control group. LEO-treated mice (100 mg/kg p.o.) showed exploratory activity times similar to control mice. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> LEO-treated mice showed a training object exploration index (TOE), novel object exploration index (NOE), and discrimination index (DI) comparable to control group. *
