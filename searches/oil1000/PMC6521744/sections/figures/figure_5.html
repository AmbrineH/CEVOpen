 <p> Effect of LEO on depression and anxiety. (A) Antidepressant-like effect induced by LEO (100 mg/kg p.o.) in the tail suspension test. Citalopram (CIT; 10 mg/kg i.p.) was used as antidepressant reference drug (one-way ANOVA, F(2,29) = 28.36, p &lt; 0.0001). Anxiolytic-like activity of LEO showed by a reduction of the time spent in the light chamber (one-way ANOVA, F(2,29) = 14.42, p &lt; 0.0001) (B) and by an increase in the number of transitions (one-way ANOVA, F(2,29) = 14.11, p &lt; 0.0001) (C). Diazepam (DIA; 1 mg/kg i.p.) was used as anxiolytic reference drug; * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.001 in comparison with control mice. </p>
