 <p> Lack of effect of LEO on memory processes. (A) In the training session of the novel object recognition test (NORT), no difference between exploration times was measured. (B) In the retention test, the exploration time of the familiar object was reduced in control group. LEO-treated mice (100 mg/kg p.o.) showed exploratory activity times similar to control mice. (C) LEO-treated mice showed a training object exploration index (TOE), novel object exploration index (NOE), and discrimination index (DI) comparable to control group. * p &lt; 0.05 in comparison with training values (Student’s t-test). </p>
