<p class="p">The oil obtained by chemical extraction can be used for consumption only after refining. A refining process is meant to purify the extracted oil from any residual solvent and other impurities. Refined olive oil is devoid of vitamins, polyphenols, phytosterols, and other low molecular natural ingredients [

Unfiltered olive oil preserves additional polyphenols of higher polarity that are typically lost with small amounts of water that are removed upon filtration.
