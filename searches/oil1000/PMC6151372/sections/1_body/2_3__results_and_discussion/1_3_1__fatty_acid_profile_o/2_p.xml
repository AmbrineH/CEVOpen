<p class="p">Further comparison of obtained data shows that employing of FB in commercial feed mixture not only enriched the mixture but modified the composition of other fatty acids. Commercial feed mixture contained a high percentage of medium-chain length saturated fatty acids, namely, lauric acid (C12:0) and myristic acid (C14:0). These fatty acids increased the growth rate and fattening rate of the birds; however, they have negative impact on bird metabolism since they cause elevation of cholesterol content in blood [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. FB did not contain any lauric acid and only a minimal amount of myristic acid. Addition of FB into commercial feed mixture led to decreasing of content of these fatty acids (
