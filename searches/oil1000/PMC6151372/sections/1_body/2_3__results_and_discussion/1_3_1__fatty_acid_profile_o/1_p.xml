<p class="p">The profile of fatty acids of fermented bioproduct (FB), commercial feed as well as the mixture of FB with commercial feed was in focus of our research. The results of analysis are in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The data shows that during SSF process the cornmeal was successfully enriched with both GLA and even with beta-carotene. The commercial feed mixture lacked these compounds. Both bioactive compounds were found in feed mixture that was provided to experimental group of birds. Thus, the intake of GLA and beta-carotene was secure during the whole experiment.
