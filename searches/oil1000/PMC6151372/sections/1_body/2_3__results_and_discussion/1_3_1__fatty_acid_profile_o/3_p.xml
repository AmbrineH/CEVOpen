<p class="p">It is known that composition of fatty acids of feed had impact on composition of fatty acid of produced meat [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Grain feed components contain little PUFAs, especially n-3 PUFAs, so there is an effort to enrich the feed with significant content of fatty acids. In order to increase n-3 PUFAs content in feed, linseed, rapeseed, soybean, and oils, or fish oil, are most commonly applied [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. All of these components increase the PUFAs share, but there is often also a reduction in the feed stability, because of the PUFAs oxidation; thus storage period is shortened and the storage conditions of the feed are stricter. Since the GLA-oil is presented in FB, there is an increased potential that it could undergo the oxidation reaction. During these reactions, the various radical oxygen species (ROS) are created. ROS have a serious negative impact on living cells and mammals leading to diseases such as cancer. As mentioned above, carotenoid pigments have been described as effective antioxidant agents due to ability to scavenge the oxygen radicals [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Thus, the presence of beta-carotene in FB sustained its oxidation stability of PUFAs and protects the birds from ROS.
