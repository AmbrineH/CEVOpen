<p class="p">The sensory evaluation of chicken breasts 24 hours after slaughter is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. In the sensory analysis of the meat samples, the following parameters were evaluated: flavour, taste, juiciness, and tenderness, with the maximum score in the monitored parameter being 5. The total maximum score for each sample was 20 points. The meat of the experimental group was evaluated on the 1st day of storage and was found to be better than the control meat (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). After 7 days of storage, the meat of the experimental group was evaluated again and deemed better than that of the control. From the evaluated parameters, the juiciness and the flavour of meat were evaluated better compared to the control (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The results show that FB feeding had a positive effect on the sensory properties of the meat produced from the breast muscle. What is important, however, is that any negative impact of FB on the rated parameters was not recorded. This confirms the trend from our previous experiments after addition of 3 and 5% FB [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], when we have similarly seen either a positive effect, or no differences were recorded in comparison with control meat. When using other sources of PUFAs in poultry diet, no negative impact on the sensory parameters of the meat was noted. The nonsignificant effect of 10 % flaxseed on sensory characteristics has also been reported [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. However, in contrast, there is a study that reported a significant reduction in the aroma, flavour, taste, and overall acceptability of nugget meat from chickens fed with increasing levels of dietary flaxseed [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. There is no literature on the sensory attributes of broiler meat being affected by feeding 10% FB available.
