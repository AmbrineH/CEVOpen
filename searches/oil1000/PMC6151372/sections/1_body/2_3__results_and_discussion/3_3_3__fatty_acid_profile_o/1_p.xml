<p class="p">The nutritional value of breast meat is also determined by the composition of fatty acids presented in meat. For better prediction of nutrition impact, the fatty acid composition has been determined in raw and cooked (boiled in water, 100Â°C, 20 min) breast meat. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The presented results confirm the claim that by varying the composition of FA in feed fats it is possible to influence the composition of FA of fats in produced meat [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. A significant increase in GLA, ALA, and oleic acid was recorded in the fat of the chicken breast muscle of the experimental group after feeding 10% of the FB, and in addition the n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio decreased. Feeding 10% FB in this experiment showed an increase in fatty acids corresponding to the composition of FA in feeds. The only exception is ALA, the proportion of which was higher in the experimental group compared to the control group, despite the fact that it was lower in the feed of the experimental group. From our point of view, there is a substantial increase in the GLA concentration, which was also the goal of our experiment. Similarly, it is possible to change the proportion of other PUFAs in the fat depending on the fat source used. The feeding of
 <italic class="italic"> Camelina sativa</italic> oil as an ALA source resulted in an increase in ALA in chicken breast; on the contrary, an increase in linoleic acid was recorded after feeding with sunflower oil [
