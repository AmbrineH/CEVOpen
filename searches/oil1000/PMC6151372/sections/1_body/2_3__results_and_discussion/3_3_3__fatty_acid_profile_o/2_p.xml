<p class="p">In the experiment, after feeding 10% FB, a decrease in the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs in the fat of the breast muscle was recorded. This improved ratio is not a result of an increase in n-3 PUFAs, but mainly by a decrease in arachidonic acid (AA). A more significant reduction in the FB ratio was not predicted, as the organic product delivers mainly n-6 PUFAs to feed mixtures. The improved ratio in fat of the experimental group may also be a result of other changes that occurred during fermentation. The content of digestible starch dropped and the content of resistance starch increased [

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. It is complicated to compare the effect of FB on the composition of FA in fat of breast muscles with other results, since a similar type of fermented feed and a 10% concentration have not been used in chickens' nutrition yet. The fermentation substrate, but mainly the lower filamentous fungi used, has a significant effect on the production of significant metabolites (PUFAs, antioxidants, and enzymes). In our previous experiments we did not notice such a significant decrease in arachidonic acid, but the ALA fraction was higher than in this experiment [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. However, a different concentration (3 and 5%) was used in both experiments, and also different lower filamentous fungi (
