<p class="p">Thermal treatment, cooking of the samples at 100Â°C for 20 minutes, varied the content of multiple fatty acids in both groups as compared to raw meat (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The most significant are the changes in AA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6, n-3). On the other hand, the content of other PUFAs, namely, GLA, ALA, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), was not influenced by thermal treatment. This suggests that the final products of PUFAs biosynthesis (AA for n-6 and DHA for n-3) have lower stability than their precursors. This is the first time that such results have been obtained and other experiments (differential thermos-oxidant capacity measurement, detailed analysis of changes in membrane and storage lipids) are necessary to confirm such data.
