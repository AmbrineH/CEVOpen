<p class="p">The results of fat oxidation, expressed as the amount of malondialdehyde, the major secondary product of PUFAs oxidation, were equal levels for both the control and the experimental group on the first day of storage of the samples in the refrigerator. After storage of the samples for 7 days in the refrigerator, the fat oxidation in both groups increased, but statistically significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) were not found compared to control group. Oxidation changes in the experimental group were recorded at the same level as the control. Oxidation of the fat in breast muscle was not affected feeding 10% FB. The same oxidative stability of the meat of the experimental group, despite the higher unsaturated fatty acids content, especially GLA and ALA, is an important finding for this work. Regarding lipid oxidation stability of the meat, the results obtained in other studies indicate that as portions of MUFA and PUFAs in chicken meat increased, the susceptibility of meat to lipid oxidation also increased over the storage time [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, oxidative changes of fats can be reduced by the addition of antioxidants in feed. Nkukwana [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] stated that the meat of chickens after feeding oil extracted from
 <italic class="italic"> Moringa oleifera</italic> leaves had much better stability than the control meat attributed to the presence of natural antioxidants from the leaves. Likewise, in the fermented product, beta-carotene was produced by fermentation as an effective antioxidant, which had an effect on improving the oxidative stability of the meat. Similarly, supplementation of broiler diets with different levels of pomegranate byproducts, a rich source of natural antioxidants, significantly reduced the oxidation of lipids of breast meat [
