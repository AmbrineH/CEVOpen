<p class="p">In the experiment, chemical analysis of breast muscle (after slaughter, dressing and heat treatment at 80Â°C for 20 minutes) was performed. The feed of the experimental group with the addition of 10% FB had an effect on the chemical composition of the chicken breast muscle. Compared with the control group, a lower water and fat content (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and a higher total protein content (
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>&lt; 0.05) in the meat of the experimental group were recorded. Heat treatment affected the composition of the samples in both groups (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Compared to raw meats, both groups experienced a drop in water content and increased fat and total protein content. When comparing the chemical composition of the meat after the heat treatment, the lower fat content was found in experimental group compared to the control. The total protein content was higher in the experimental group, but statistical differences were not recorded between the groups (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). It is concluded that feeding 10% FB has had an effect on reducing the fat content in chicken breast muscle. This is confirmed by the results obtained in the previous experiment [

In contrast, other studies indicate that the fat supplements used in poultry feed (flax and fish oil) did not have a statistically significant effect on the fat content of the breast muscle [
