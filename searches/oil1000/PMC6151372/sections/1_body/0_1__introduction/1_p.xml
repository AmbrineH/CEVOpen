<p class="p">Cereals are a staple food used in human and livestock nutrition. They are the most important energy sources and they provide various macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, dietary fibre, and lipids) and some micronutrients (vitamins, polyphenols, and minerals) for consumers [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, cereals lack a variety of essential nutrients, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and carotenoid pigments [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. PUFAs are structural components of cell membranes and they regulate flexibility, fluidity, and permeability of membranes. Also, they play a key role in mammalian metabolism as a precursor of metabolites controlling critical biological function such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Insufficient dietary consumption of PUFAs may lead to physiological imbalances of organisms, which may manifest in the form of diabetes, hypertension, inflammatory response problems, etc. [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Carotenoid pigments show many protective effects against malfunctions related to oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular and cancer diseases [
