<p class="p">Solid state fermentation (SSF) is the oldest known fermentation technique. It imitates the natural environment of the microorganism. It involves a solid matrix that serves a dual function: as support and as a source of nutrients for microbes kept under conditions with a limited amount of free water [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. During microbial growth, the solid matrix is enriched with various types of metabolites according to the employed microbe. Due to a limited amount of water present in the SSF process, the most promising class of microbes to be used are filamentous fungi [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Moreover, the oleaginous lower filamentous fungi belonging to the
 <italic class="italic"> Zygomycetes</italic> family (e.g.,
 <italic class="italic"> Thamnidium, Cunninghamella, Mortierella, Umbelopsis, </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> Mucor</italic>) are very well known as producers of various PUFAs (e.g., gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid) and carotenoid pigments in submerge as well as solid-state fermentation process [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Thus, SSF is one of the most qualified techniques for natural enrichment of solid material, such as cereals, with desired metabolites. One of the biggest advantages of material (bioproduct) obtained after SSF is that it can be used directly as a supplement for human or livestock nutrition without any further downstream processing, which improves the economy of the whole process.
