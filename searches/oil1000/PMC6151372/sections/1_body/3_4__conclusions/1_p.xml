<p class="p">This work demonstrates the possibility of using the oil-producing lower filamentous fungi and SSF for the production of a fermented bioproduct (FB), which, by feeding to poultry, can significantly improve the quality and oxidative stability of the fat in produced meat. The FB prepared on the basis of cornmeal increased the GLA share and improved the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs in raw meat. The stability of the fatty acids was maintained even after the heat treatment. It is also important to note that FB has improved the sensory properties of the produced meat. The oxidative stability of the meat during storage in the refrigerator was not affected by FB feeding. SSF feed production is an interesting form of production of significant fatty acids and beta-carotene, important ingredients that can be used to enrich the poultry diet and which subsequently increase the share of significant PUFAs and the oxidative stability of fats in the produced meat.</p>
