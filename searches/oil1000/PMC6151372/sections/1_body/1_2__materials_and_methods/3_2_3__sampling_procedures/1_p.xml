 <sup class="sup">th</sup> day, the chickens were, after being stunned, bled and their carcasses were dressed. Subsequently, samples of breast muscle were collected. To determine the fatty acid profile, breast tissue samples (16 in each group) were packaged in polyethylene bags and stored in the freezer for analysis (maximum up to 1 month). For determination of the stability of the FA after heat treatment, half of the samples (8 pieces) were heated at 80°C in the core of the meat for 20 minutes. To detect antioxidant activity and oxidative changes of fats during storage of breast muscle samples in the refrigerator, samples (16 pieces per group) were packaged in polyethylene bags and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C for 7 days. For sensory analysis, samples of breast muscle (16 pieces per group) were packed into containers and evaluated 24 hours after slaughtering and after storage of sample for 7 days under chilled conditions (4°C).
