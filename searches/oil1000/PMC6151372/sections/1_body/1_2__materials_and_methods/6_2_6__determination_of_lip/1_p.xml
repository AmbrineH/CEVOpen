<p class="p">The extent of lipid oxidation was evaluated as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. A minced sample (1.5 g) was weighed in the test tube, 1 ml of 0.3% Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetate was added and gently mixed with the sample, then 5 ml of 0.8% Butylhydroxytoluene in hexane was added, and the content of the test tube was mixed again. Shortly before homogenization, 8 ml of ice-cold 5% Trichloracetic acid (TCA) was added and homogenized for 30 seconds at 10.000 rpm (IKA S 18N-19G, Germany). After homogenization, the sample was left for 10 minutes and centrifuged for 5 minutes (3500 g, 4°C). Subsequently, the top hexane layer was removed, the sample was filtered (Whatman 4) and added to a 10 ml 5% TCA in a graduated flask. One ml of 0.8% thiobarbituric acid was added to 4 ml of sample in the test tube. Samples were incubated in a water bath for 30 minutes at 70°C. TBARS values were measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm (Helios 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>, v. 4.6 Thermo Spectronic, Cambridge, UK). TBARS values were determined within 24 hours after slaughter and after 7-day storage in refrigerator (4°C). TBARS results were quantified as malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents and expressed as milligrams of malondialdehyde per kilogram of sample (mg.kg
