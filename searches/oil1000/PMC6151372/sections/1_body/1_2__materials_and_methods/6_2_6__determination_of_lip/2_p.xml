<p class="p">To determine the antioxidant activity of the breast muscles, a 3 g of sample was weighed into a 50 ml centrifuge test tube; 15 ml of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added and homogenized (3500 rpm) for 1 minute [

The lipids and aqueous supernatant were separated by centrifugation (3500 rpm) for 5 minutes at 4°C. TCA supernatant was used to determine the antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity was measured spectrophotometrically by the method of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging [
