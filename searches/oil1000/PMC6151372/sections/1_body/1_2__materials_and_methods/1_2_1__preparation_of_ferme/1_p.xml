<p class="p">The strain
 <italic class="italic"> Umbelopsis isabellina</italic> CCF2412 was obtained from Culture Collection of Fungi, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. This strain was described as a producer of both GLA and beta-carotene [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The culture was maintained on potato-dextrose agar (PDA; Carl Roth, Germany) at 4°C and reinoculated every 3 months. The spore suspension for inoculation of SSF was prepared from a 7-day-old culture grown on polished rice (28°C). The spores were washed with sterile distilled water with 0.05% (v/v) of Tween 80 and the spore suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 2.10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> spores/mL. The substrate for SSF, cornmeal, was obtained from company Amylum Slovakia (Boleráz, Slovak Republic). HDPE bags were filled with 100 g of cornmeal, moistened with distilled water (ratio 1:1) for 2 hours, and then autoclaved at 105°C for 1 hour. The cooled substrate was inoculated with 20 mL of spore suspension (prepared as described above). SSF was run for 7 days at 28°C. After fermentation, the obtained bioproduct was dried at 50°C until constant weight was achieved. The prepared dry bioproduct was packed and sent to University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy in Košice (Slovak Republic) for bird feeding.
