<p class="p">Fatty acids were analyzed as their methyl esters (FAMEs) using gas chromatography. The methyl esters were prepared from lipid extract obtained from Soxhlet extraction. 2 mg of total lipid was diluted in hexane and 2-step esterification was performed using sodium methoxide in the first step and a solution of hydrochloric acid in methanol in second. The reaction was run for 1 hour, and the samples were consecutively centrifuged (5 min, 3000 x
