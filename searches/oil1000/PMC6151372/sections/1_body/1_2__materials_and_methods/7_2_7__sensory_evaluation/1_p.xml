Seven evaluators, who were trained in the field of descriptive analysis and terminology, were selected from the employees of the Institute of Hygiene and Meat Technology of UVLF in Košice. Samples of the meat were evaluated 24 hours after slaughter and storage in a refrigerator (4°C). The samples were heat-treated by the cooking method, achieving and maintaining an internal temperature of 70°C for 10 minutes. After cooking, the samples were cooled to 40°C, and they were administered to the panellists to assess the sensory properties. A 5-point rating system was used for each evaluated property: flavour, taste, juiciness, and tenderness (maximum 20 points).
