 <p class="p">The aim of this work was to analyse the effect of addition of 10% (w/w) fermented bioproduct into commercial broiler feed on fatty acid profile, lipid oxidative stability, and sensory properties of chicken breast meat. The fermented bioproduct was prepared by fermentation of cornmeal by filamentous fungi
  <italic class="italic"> Umbelopsis isabellina</italic> CCF 2412 in solid-state fermentation (SSF) process and the final bioproduct was enriched with gamma-linolenic acid and beta-carotene. In the experiment, 80 pieces of 1-day-old chickens COBB 500 were used. Half of them (control group) were fed only with commercial feed. Chickens of the experimental group were fed with commercial feed, and, from the 11
  <sup class="sup">th</sup> day of age until the time of slaughter (39
  <sup class="sup">th</sup> day), 10% of commercial feed was replaced with fermented bioproduct. Application of fermented bioproduct into commercial feed mixture positively influenced profile of fatty acids in breast meat. The amount of gamma-linolenic, alpha-linolenic, and oleic acids in fat of breast muscles was increased and n-6/n-3 ratio was significantly decreased. Profile and content of PUFAs did not change after thermal treatment of meat. Oxidative stability of fat and sensory properties of the meat during the storage (4Â°C, 7 days) of meat were not affected by fermented bioproduct.
