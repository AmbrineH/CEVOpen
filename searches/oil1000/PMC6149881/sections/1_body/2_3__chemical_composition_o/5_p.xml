 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic> EO was obtained using different extraction methods including conventional hydrodistillation, microwave-assisted hydrodistillation, solvent free microwave hydrodistillation and improved solvent-free microwave extraction with three types of microwave-absorption medium. Results showed that α-zingiberene was the most abundant compound found in all EOs studied ranging from 17.4 to 25.4%, followed by ar-curcumene (14.1–16.4%), β-bisabolene (9.9–12.5%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (9.7–13.4%) [
