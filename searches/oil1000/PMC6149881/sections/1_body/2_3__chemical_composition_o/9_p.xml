<p class="p">The composition of EO may vary not only within different ginger cultivars, but also according to the parts of the plant studied, as demonstrated by Sivasothy et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], who showed that the composition of EO obtained by hydrodistillation of the leaves and rhizomes of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic> var. Rubrum Theilade were different. In fact, Î²-caryophyllene (31.7%) was the major compound found in the leaf oil, while rhizome oil was predominantly rich in monoterpenoids, such as camphene (14.5%), geranial (14.3%) and geranylacetate (13.7%).
