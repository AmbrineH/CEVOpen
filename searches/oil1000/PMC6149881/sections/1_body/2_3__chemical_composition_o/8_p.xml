<p class="p">Three sub Himalayan ginger cultivars, namely Gorubathane, Shingboi and Thingria were studied for their EO composition. Results showed that α-zingiberene (32.2%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (10.9%) were the major compounds in Gorubathane EO, whereas α-zingiberene (12.58%) and ar-curcumene (9.89%) were mostly present in Thingria EO. However, geranial (20.07%) and neral (9.44%) were the main constituents found in Shingboi EO [
