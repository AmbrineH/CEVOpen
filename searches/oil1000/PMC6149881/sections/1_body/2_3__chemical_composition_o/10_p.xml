<p class="p">Regarding the extraction methods used, water and steam distillation were used to obtain EO from Vietnamese 
 <italic class="italic">Z. officinale</italic>. The main EO components obtained by water distillation were α-cucurmene (11.7%) and β-bisabolene (4.1%), while those obtained by steam distillation were ar-curcumene (12.6%), α-zingiberene (10.3%), β-bisabolene (8.1%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (7.4%). The difference in the composition can be because, during water distillation, the raw material was in contact with water, which is not the case during steam distillation. As a result, the extraction method used may affect the composition of the EO released [
