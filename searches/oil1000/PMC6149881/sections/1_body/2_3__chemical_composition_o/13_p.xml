<p class="p">The chemical composition of a species native to Thailand, 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber cassumunar</italic> Roxb., showed that major compounds were sabinene (36.71–53.50%), γ-terpinene (5.27–7.25%), terpinen-4-ol (21.85–29.96%) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) butadiene (0.95–16.16%). The EO yield ranged from 1.26% to 1.37% [

 <italic class="italic">Z. cassumunar</italic> rhizome EO where the major constituents were terpinen-4-ol (40.5 ± 6.6%) and sabinene (17.4 ± 1.4%) [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. These phytochemicals have shown various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antibacterial effects [
