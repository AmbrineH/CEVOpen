<p class="p">The potential use of ginger essential oil as food preservatives and, therefore, could include the control of microorganisms’ overgrowth in fresh and fresh-cut fruits and vegetables that are intended to be consumed without a cooking step. As an example, shredded green or unripe papaya is used in several types of Asian cuisine, including Thai papaya salad. The ability of three amounts of ginger essential oil (5, 10 or 15 µL) to control bacterial, mould, and yeast growth in shredded green papaya stored at 13 °C for four days was evaluated [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. The populations of bacteria and yeasts were approximately 3-log lower on shredded green papaya treated with the highest concentration of ginger essential oil compared to the untreated control [

 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>, or both. Often, poultry carcasses are rinsed or immersed in a water bath containing an antimicrobial chemical (e.g., chlorine). The practice is used in part to reduce the microbial load, including foodborne pathogens, on the carcass prior to packaging and shipment to the consumer. Avoiding toxic compounds, consumers would likely meet utilization of essential oils to control microorganisms on poultry carcasses with a positive response. In a study, chicken breast and whole leg samples were immersed for 2 min in various concentrations of ginger essential oil (1:150, 1:250 and 1:550) and then total aerobic bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> populations determined [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. A highly significant reduction in population of total aerobic bacteria—
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>—occurred following treatment, higher than a 3-log reduction in the populations of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> on the surface of chicken was achieved [
