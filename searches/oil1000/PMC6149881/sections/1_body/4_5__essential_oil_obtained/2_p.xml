<p class="p">A wealth of new technologies including high hydrostatic pressure, ionization radiation, and bioactive packaging can reduce or eliminate the need for utilization of traditional food preservatives. The major drawback of these technologies is associated with cost and feasibility of use in a range of food products. In the past decade, attention has been focused on the utilization of plant essential oils as natural antimicrobials in foods. Essential oils have been found to exhibit a broad range of activity against spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with food. They have been derived, in particular, from
