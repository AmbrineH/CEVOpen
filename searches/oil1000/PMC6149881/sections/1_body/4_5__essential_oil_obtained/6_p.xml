From clinical trials, we can remark about which concentrations can be considered of reasonably safe for human consumption. The daily dose of oral administration of ginger ranged from 500 mg/day to 1000 mg/day; at these concentrations, adverse effects were rare and mainly in the form of gastrointestinal discomfort [
