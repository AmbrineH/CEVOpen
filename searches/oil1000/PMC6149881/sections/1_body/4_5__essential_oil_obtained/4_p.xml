<p class="p">As antimould agent in food preservation, zingiber essential oils showed controversial properties. If yeasts in food spoilage present no human health concern, moulds can produce mycotoxins, which, in the worst-case scenario, can result in chronic toxicity and death. Essential oils of ginger exhibited poor activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium</italic> spp. (MIC = 869.2 mg/mL) and no activity against 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. These results are in agreement with other reports [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. In contrast, ginger essential oil was reported to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium verticilliodes</italic> (MIC = 2500 μg/mL) and the production of fumonisin B1 and fumonisin B2 at concentrations of 4000 and 2000 μg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Eventually, the growth of yeasts, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida utilis</italic> was not inhibited by exposure to ginger essential oil [
