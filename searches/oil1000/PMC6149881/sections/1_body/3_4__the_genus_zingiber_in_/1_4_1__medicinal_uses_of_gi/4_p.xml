<p class="p">Although still under debate, anticancer activity of ginger is, as mentioned above, mainly related to the high content of 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol. Ginger and related bioactive molecules, indeed, are effective in controlling, in vitro, viability and invasiveness of colorectal, gastric, ovarian, liver, skin, breast, and prostate cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Recent evidence supports, in particular, the role of zingerone supplementation as chemopreventive agent, reducing cancer incidence in dimethyl hydrazine treated rats; the mechanism included the inhibition of cell proliferation, the induction of cell apoptosis, and the suppression of NF-κB and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The proapoptotic effect and the promotion of cell cycle arrest in hepatoma and prostate cancer cells were ascribed to the activation of caspase cascade and the impairment of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, particularly by 6-gingerol [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], which was also able to inhibit angiogenesis and invasiveness in the murine cancer models [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Anti-angiogenetic activity of 6-gingerol occurs by the inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while its anti-metastatic activity could be ascribed to regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 transcription [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Another active compound contained in ginger is zerumbone, which induced apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells, through the p53 signal pathway and increasing the activity of caspase-3 [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. In humans, the chemopreventive effect of ginger has been mainly investigated against colorectal cancer, in virtue of its anti-inflammatory effects, similarly to those of aspirin. Ginger significantly lowered COX-1 protein expression in patients at increased risk for colorectal cancer [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>], but with no effect on eicosanoid levels [
