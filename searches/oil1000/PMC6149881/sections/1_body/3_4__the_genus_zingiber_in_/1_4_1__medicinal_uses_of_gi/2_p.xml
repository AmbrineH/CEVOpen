<p class="p">According to recent literature, ginger anti-inflammatory properties are mediated by the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase or prostaglandin synthetase, which reduces biosynthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8; tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) [

 <xref rid="B66-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] has been in vitro demonstrated to inhibit the hydroxyl radicals and the lipid peroxidation products. This was consistent with further studies in animal models, which revealed as it acted by enhancing antioxidant enzyme defenses and serum glutathione [

 <xref rid="B67-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. 6-Shogaol, in particular, showed the most potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, due to the presence of α, β-unsaturated ketone moiety [
