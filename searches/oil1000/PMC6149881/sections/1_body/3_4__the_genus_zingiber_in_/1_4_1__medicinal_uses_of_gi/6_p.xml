<p class="p">As antimicrobial agent, ginger extract exhibited higher antifungal than antibacterial effects in vitro, showing anti-
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> activity against strains isolated from patients. This finding was related to the high anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, at concentrations ranging from 0.625 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Ginger was also effective against other fungal strains, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp., and it inhibited the growth of fungi that were resistant to amphotericin B and ketoconazole [

 <xref rid="B84-molecules-22-02145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. On the other hand, the antidiarrheal activity of 6-gingerol has been accredited to its ability to bind to the toxin produced by
