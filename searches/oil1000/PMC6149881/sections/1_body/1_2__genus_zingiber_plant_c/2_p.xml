<p class="p">A transplanting technique in ginger by using single bud sprouts (about 5 g) is recommended to produce high quality planting material with reduced cost. The technique involves raising transplants from single sprout seed rhizomes in the pro-tray and planting in the field after 30â€“40 days. This technique is greatly useful for reducing the quantity of rhizome seed [
