 <italic class="italic">Zingiber</italic> spp. plants are aromatic, perennial herbs with the characteristics of growing horizontal or fibrous rhizomes. They are cultivated in many countries, though these plants prefer moist, tropical conditions. Ginger thrives in well drained soils like sandy loam, clay loam, red loam or lateritic loam. A friable loam with a pH of 6.0 to 6.5 rich in humus is optimal for production of

Ginger is propagated by portions of rhizomes known as seed rhizomes. Preserved seed rhizomes are carefully cut into small pieces of 2.5–5.0 cm length weighing 20–25 g; each of the pieces should have one or two buds. China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Philippines, Thailand and India are the main ginger producers. Ginger reaches full maturity in 210–240 days after planting. Harvesting of ginger for vegetable purposes starts after 180 days based on the demand. As ginger is used in many different forms and high amounts are consumed in the countries where it is grown or is used to provide seeds for the next crop, it is difficult to get accurate figures of trade of

To enhance the productivity of crops, in some countries, at the time of planting, people use decomposed cattle manure or compost at 25–30 t/ha, either by broadcasting over the beds prior to planting or applying them in the pits at the time of planting. Rhizome seed generation is difficult and expensive. Therefore, people are looking for other techniques to cultivate
