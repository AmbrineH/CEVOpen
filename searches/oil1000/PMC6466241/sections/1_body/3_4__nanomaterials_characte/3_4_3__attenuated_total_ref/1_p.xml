<p class="p">This process of spectroscopy, which includes the infrared light, falls into the prism in such a way that the angle exceeds the critical angle for internal reflection. This produces an evanescent wave at the surface (reflecting). The change of the evanescent wave is measured, producing a spectrum, which is then subject to a Fourier transform. This technique is a very reliable and efficient fingerprinting method [
 <xref rid="B49-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. This technique is used to characterise and identify many substances. The main strength of this techniques is its IR radiation, which is an analytical technique to obtain spectra from different states of matter. This has been used to analyse solids, liquids and gases by means of transmitting the infrared radiation directly through the sample. The sample is in a liquid or solid form, and the intensity of the spectral features is determined by the thickness of the sample. Typically, this sample thickness cannot be more than a few tens of microns [
