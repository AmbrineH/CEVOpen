<p class="p">Sample characteristics, such as aggregation, folding or conformation can be monitored as a function of various preparations, solvent conditions, temperature or time. The system is used to pre-screen samples under the conditions in which the calorimetry experiment is planned. The instrument can be operated between 4 and 60 °C. It is equipped with software that outputs information about the hydrodynamic radius (in the sample size range of 0.5–1 μm) along with the percentage distribution of various components in the sample. Small traces of aggregation or oligomerisation can be checked and corrected for by improving the buffer conditions or choosing the optimal temperature for the calorimetry experiment [
