<p class="p">All the molecules in the solution are being hit with light, and all the molecules diffract light in all directions. The diffracted light from all the molecules can either interfere constructively (light regions) or destructively (dark regions) [

This process is repeated at short time intervals, and the resulting set of speckle patterns is analysed by an autocorrelator that compares the intensity of light at each spot over time. DLS delivers a quick and appropriate evaluation of the size of nanoemulsions. Therefore, it is used to evaluate the size distribution and the stability of nanoemulsions [
