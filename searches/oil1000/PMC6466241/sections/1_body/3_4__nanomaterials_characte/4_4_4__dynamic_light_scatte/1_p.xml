<p class="p">Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a technique that can be used to analyse the size distribution profile of small particles in any solution. The fluctuations can be easily determined and analysed by the magnitude of the intensity or by the function of photon autocorrelation. With respect to the time domain analysis, the autocorrelation function generally decays starting from zero-delay time, and faster dynamics due to smaller particles lead to faster decorrelation of scattered intensity trace [
