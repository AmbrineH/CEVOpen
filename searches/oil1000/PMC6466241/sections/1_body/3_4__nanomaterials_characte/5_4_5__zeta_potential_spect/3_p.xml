<p class="p">The electric potential of a surface is the amount of work that needs to be done to bring a unit’s positive charge from infinity to the surface without any acceleration. The inner layer consists predominantly of ions/molecules with opposite charge to that of the particle (Stern layer). Beyond the Stern layer, the electrostatic effects due to the surface charge on the particles decreases as per Debye’s law, which states that with the distance of each Debye length, the field decreases by a factor of 1/e [

 <xref rid="B55-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Due to the electrostatic field of the charged NPs, a diffuse layer consisting of both same and opposite charged ions/molecules grows beyond the Stern layer; and, along with the Stern layer, the diffuse layer forms the EDL. Zeta potential spectroscopy helps in the determination of the colloidal stability and the surface charge on the NP. The composition of this diffuse layer is dynamic and varies depending on a variety of factors, e.g., pH, ionic strength, concentration, etc.
