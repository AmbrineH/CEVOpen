 <xref rid="B56-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] conducted a study on the encapsulation of epigallocatechin gallate in zein/chitosan nanoparticles for controlled applications in food systems. They performed Zeta potential analysis using a laser light scattering instrument at 25 ℃ and a scattering angle of 90° and found that the particle size of EGCG-encapsulated zein/CS NPs was not as consistent as other formulations.
