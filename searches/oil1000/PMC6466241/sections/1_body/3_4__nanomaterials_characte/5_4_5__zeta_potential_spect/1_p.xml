<p class="p">The Zeta potential is also referred as “electrokinetic potential”. Many nanoparticles or colloidal particles have a surface charge when they are in suspension. When an electric field is applied, the particles move due to the interaction between the charged particle and applied field. The direction and velocity of the motion is a function of particle charge, the suspending medium and the electric field strength. Particle velocity is then measured by observing the Doppler shift in the scattered light. The particle velocity is proportional to the electrical potential of the particle at the shear plane, which is zeta potential. Thus, this optical measurement of the particle motion under an applied field can be used to the determine zeta potential.</p>
