<p class="p">Raman spectroscopy is based on the phenomenon of scattering of light. In this technique, high intensity light is scattered with a probability that one in million photons will group with the rotational and the vibrational sample state and emit slightly diverse wavelength of light. Raman spectra are of very low intensity. The whole process depends upon inelastic scattering of laser light (monochromatic) known as Raman scattering. The interaction of the laser with phonons or molecular vibrations and other excitations result in a shift in the energy of the photons [

The change in the shift gives information about the phonon modes in the specific system. The effect comes into existence when the laser light interacts with the electron cloud of molecules [
 <xref rid="B42-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The Raman effect occurs when light impinges upon a molecule, interacts with the electron cloud of the bonds of that molecule and an incident photon excites one of the electrons into a virtual state.
