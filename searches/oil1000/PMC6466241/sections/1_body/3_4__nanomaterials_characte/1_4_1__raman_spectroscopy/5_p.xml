 <xref rid="B43-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] showed that the feasibility of applying SERS for detection must be at least 1 mg/g for phosmet and 0.5 mg/g for carbaryl in apples. Luo et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] analysed thiabendazole and phosmet, which has a broad range of applications in the analysis of other trace amounts of chemicals contaminants in food.
