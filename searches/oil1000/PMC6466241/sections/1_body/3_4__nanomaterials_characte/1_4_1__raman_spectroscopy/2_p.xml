<p class="p">Stokes Raman scattering is generated when a molecule gets excited from the ground state to a virtual energy state and then relaxes into a vibrational excited state [

 <xref rid="B41-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In order to exhibit the Raman effect, the amount of deformation of the electron cloud or the molecular changes in polarizability is required with respect to the vibrational coordinate [
 <xref rid="B42-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The change in the intensity of the Raman scattering can be determined by the change in the amount of polarizability, and the vibrational level is equal to the Raman shift.
