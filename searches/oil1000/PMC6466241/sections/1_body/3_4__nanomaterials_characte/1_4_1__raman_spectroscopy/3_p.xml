<p class="p">Raman spectroscopy helps to provide the fingerprint of a molecule, which can help in the identification of the molecule in the range of 500–2000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Many practical applications are based on Raman gas analyser. Raman spectroscopy is used to characterise materials, measure temperature and find the crystallographic orientation of a sample.
