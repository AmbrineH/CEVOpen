<p class="p">XPS can identify the elemental compositions of materials by measuring the Kinetic Energies (KEs) of their ejected electrons. XPS can detect the X-ray. XPS is sensitive to the chemical environments of the atoms it detects. The change in the chemical composition or a shift in the chemical composition is responsible for the change in the positions of the photoelectron signals, which can be helpful in identifying the chemical states of elements.</p>
