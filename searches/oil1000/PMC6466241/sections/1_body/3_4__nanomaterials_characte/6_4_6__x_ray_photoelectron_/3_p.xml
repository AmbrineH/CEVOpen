 <xref rid="B58-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] used XPS analysis in their study to investigate the surface composition of NPs and the oxidation states of the Cu species to study the degradation of Amaranth food dye by heterogeneous electro-Fenton process. XPS analysis shows that there is a strong exclusion of copper species to the surface of the nanoparticle, as observed on copper spinel oxides.
