<p class="p">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive quantitative spectroscopic method that measures the elemental composition of the materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most important and widely used surface analytical techniques. This technique provides chemical information about the surfaces. The principle of XPS is based on the generation of the X-ray by electron bombardment of a metal target. Mostly Al or Mg is used as the target source [

These incident X-rays are entirely absorbed by an atom. The injections of the electrons depend upon the amount of binding of the core electrons. If the binding energy is less than the photon energy, then the electrons may emit from the surface.
