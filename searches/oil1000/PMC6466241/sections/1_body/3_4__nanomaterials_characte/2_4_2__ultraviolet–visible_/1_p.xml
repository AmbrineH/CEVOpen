<p class="p">Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy refers to absorption or reflectance spectroscopy in the UV–visible spectral region. Absorption spectroscopy refers to a technique that measures the absorption of radiation with respect to the function of the wavelength or frequency. The absorption affects the identify colour in the visible range [

The molecules, which hold n-electrons and π-electrons can absorb ultraviolet or visible light in the form of energy to excite these electrons into higher orbitals. The electron excitation tendency is directly proportional to the capacity to absorb the wavelength of the light.
