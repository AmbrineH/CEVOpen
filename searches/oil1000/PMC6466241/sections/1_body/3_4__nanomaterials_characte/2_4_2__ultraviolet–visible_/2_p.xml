<p class="p">UVâ€“Vis spectroscopy is often used in chemistry for quantitative analytics, such as highly conjugated organic compounds, biological macromolecules and transition metal ions. Spectroscopic analysis is observed mainly in solutions, but it is not limited in other states of matter. The solutions of transition metal change colour when the electrons excite from one state to another after absorbing light.</p>
