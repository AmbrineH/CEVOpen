<p class="p">Primarily nanoparticles are characterised by evaluating the distributed particle size and morphology of the material. Electron microscopy helps in the evaluation of nanoparticle size, as well as morphology. Various studies have highlighted the effect of the size of nanoparticles on their application Nanomaterials can be used as bioactives in functional foods [
 <xref rid="B5-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Reducing the particle size of bioactives may improve the availability, delivery properties and solubility of the bioactives and thus their biological activity, because the biological activity of a substance depends on its ability to be transferred across intestinal membranes into the blood [
 <xref rid="B6-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Smaller particles are likely to combine during storage and help in the transportation of the dispersed nanoparticles. The smaller the size of the nanoparticles, the larger the surface area, which results in fast release. Polymer degradation is also affected by the size of the particles [
