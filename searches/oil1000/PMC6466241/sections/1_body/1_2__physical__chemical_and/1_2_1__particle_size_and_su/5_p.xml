<p class="p">Three-dimensional nanomaterials are bulk materials that are not restrained to the nanoscale. Therefore, they are considered to have three random dimensions greater than 100 nm. With respect to their nanocrystalline structure, bulk nanomaterials can be formed by multiple arrangements of nanosized crystals. 3D nanomaterials contain bundles of nanowires or nanotubes and nanoparticle dispersion.</p>
