<p class="p">Particles of nanostructured material range from 1 to 100 nm in size. Nanostructured material (NSM) consists of interfacial layers, which have ions and organic and inorganic molecules that are responsible for all the alterations in the properties of the matter. NSM are mainly classified into four categories: zero-dimensional nanoparticles (0D NSM), one-dimensional nanoparticles (1D NSM), two-dimensional nanoparticles (2D NSM) and three-dimensional nanoparticles (3D NSM) [
