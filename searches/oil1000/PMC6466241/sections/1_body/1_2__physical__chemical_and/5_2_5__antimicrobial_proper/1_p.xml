<p class="p">Nanoparticles that exhibits antimicrobial property either kill the microorganisms or decrease their growth rate. Antibacterial agents are broadly classified into two categories: bactericidal (kills the bacteria) or bacteriostatic (decreasing the growth rate of bacteria) [
 <xref rid="B23-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The antimicrobial property of the nanoparticle depends on certain properties, such as size, surface area, morphology of the crystal reactive sites etc [
 <xref rid="B23-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The main mechanism by which the nanoparticles exhibit antimicrobial property is not understood completely. By means of electrostatic interaction, nanoparticles can attach to the cell membrane and disrupt it. An important role is played by peptidoglycan on nanoparticles activity, but its effect also depends on various environmental conditions, such as pH, structure of nanoparticle, etc. The interaction of nanoparticles is also different for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. For gram-negative bacteria, the penetration of the particles depends on the size, charge and other properties of the material [

The PBAT/AgNPs composite films with promising antimicrobial activity and improved film properties have a high potential for application as an active food packaging to secure food safety and to prolong the shelf-life of packaged foods.
