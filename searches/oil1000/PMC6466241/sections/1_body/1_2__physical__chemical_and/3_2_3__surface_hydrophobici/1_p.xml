<p class="p">Advancements in research have led to the development of various sophisticated tools for analysing a nanoparticleâ€™s surface property. The property of a nanoparticle that affects the reaction of the nanoparticle in an aqueous environment and gives information regarding the transport of the nanoparticle is surface hydrophobicity [

 <xref rid="B19-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]; therefore, its characterisation helps in assessing the contact and hazards of the nanoparticle. The characterisation of hydrophobicity for a nanoparticle is not simple and has many challenges. Various techniques are utilised for determining surface hydrophobicity, such as biphasic partitioning, the measurement of the contact angle, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and the absorption of probes. Recent techniques, such as X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, determine the hydrophobicity of the surface and identify the particular chemical groups on the surface of the nanoparticle [

Their droplets are stabilised to differing extents by proteins, small-molecule surfactants (emulsifiers) and, in certain cases, polysaccharides (hydrocolloids). To produce effective stabilisation of O/W emulsions, it has been found that the surface character of hydrophilic silica particles must be made somewhat hydrophobic.
