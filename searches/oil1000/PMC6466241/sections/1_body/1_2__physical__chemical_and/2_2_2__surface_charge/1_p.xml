<p class="p">One of the most important characteristics to determine various characteristics of a nanoparticle is the surface charge. It helps in the determination of the colloidal stability [

 <xref rid="B10-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], nanostructure of the material, self-assembly of the nanoparticle [

 <xref rid="B13-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The electrostatic interaction of a nanoparticle with the environment, such as the bioactive compounds, is determined by the surface charge. The stability of colloidal nanomaterial is generally analysed by the zeta potential of its nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B14-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Zeta potential is the value of the surface charge of a nanoparticle at specific environmental conditions of the medium, such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, etc. It is measured by assessing the potential difference between the surface of shear and the outer Helmholtz plane and thus gives us the stability of the sample [
 <xref rid="B14-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Zeta potential values are either positive or negative, ensuring the stability and avoiding the agglomeration of the particle. The pH of the solution determines the ionization of surface groups and, therefore, the final surface charge density [
 <xref rid="B15-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Normally for the layer by layer (LBL) deposition technique, the pH of the solution should be selected so that the signs of the electrical charges on the particle surface and adsorbing polyelectrolyte are opposite, and the magnitude of the charges on both species is sufficiently high [
 <xref rid="B16-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Many of the polyelectrolytes used in the food industry have ionisable groups that are relatively weak acids or bases.
