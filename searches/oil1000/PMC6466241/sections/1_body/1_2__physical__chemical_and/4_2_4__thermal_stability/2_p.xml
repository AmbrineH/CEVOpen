In the case of nanocrystalline material, the contribution of interfacial energy term (Gint) to free energy cannot be neglected as in coarse-grained polycrystalline materials. The interfacial free energy of nanocrystalline materials can be expressed as: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">∆Gint = 3 γint Vm/d</disp-formula> where Vm is the molar and d is the crystallite size. In the nanocrystalline state, β may become stable if Gα + Gα int &gt; Gβ + Gβ int. In other words, if the rate of increase of total free energy (G + Gint) with the decrease in crystallite size of the α phase is higher than that of the β phase, the latter will become stable over the former below a critical crystallite size [

For instance, addition of nanoclay in polylactic acid (PLA) film enhances its thermal stability and mechanical properties [
