<p class="p">Nanostructures are very small in size and cannot be visualised by the naked eye, as well by optical microscope. Optical microscopes have the range for observing micron-structured material with a limited resolution. They are also unable to magnify more due to the divergence and limit of the lightâ€™s wavelength. Nevertheless, it is important to characterise the nanostructure structurally. Therefore, several techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) have been developed to observe and characterise the surface and structural property of nanostructured material. All these techniques differ in their mechanisms but ultimately form a highly magnified image of the sample or the surface.</p>
