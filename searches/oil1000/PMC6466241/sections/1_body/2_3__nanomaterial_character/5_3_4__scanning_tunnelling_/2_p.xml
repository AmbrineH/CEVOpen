<p class="p">The components of an STM include a scanning tip, piezoelectric-controlled height, x, y scanner, coarse sample-to-tip control, vibration isolation system and computer. When a conducting tip is brought very near to the surface to be examined, a bias (voltage difference) applied between the two can allow electrons to tunnel through the vacuum between them [

 <xref rid="B39-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The output (tunnelling current) is a function of applied voltage, tip position and the local density of states (LDOS) of the sample. Information can be obtained by analysing the current as the tipâ€™s position scans across the surface and is usually displayed image form. STM can require extremely clean and stable surfaces, sharp tips, excellent vibration control and sophisticated electronics.
