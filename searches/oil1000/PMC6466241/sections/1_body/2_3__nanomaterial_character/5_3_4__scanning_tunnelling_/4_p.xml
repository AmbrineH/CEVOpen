 <xref rid="B40-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] used STM to study a novel nanoparticle system for biosensor application. They immobilised CdS quantum dots on gold and recorded the sample in air at a voltage of 0.5 V and a reference current of 1 nA. From the STM images, they found that the NPs maintain their original size without being agglomerated in the immobilised state.
