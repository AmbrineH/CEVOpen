<p class="p">The resolution of an image is limited by the radius of the curvature of the scanning tip of the STM. Additionally, image artefacts can occur if the tip has two tips at the end rather than a single atom; this leads to “double-tip imaging”—a situation in which both tips contribute to the tunnelling [
