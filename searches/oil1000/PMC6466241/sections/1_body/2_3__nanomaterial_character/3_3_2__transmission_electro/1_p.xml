 <xref rid="B35-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. An electron beam is transmitted through an ultra-thin sample and interacts while passing through it. The advancement in transmission electron microscopy facilitated the direct imaging of the structure of the atom of the solid and the surface by gathering information about the size, crystallinity, shape and the interaction of the particle. TEM creates a very high-resolution image of around 0.1 nm. It is also an important technique for chemical characterization as the beam of the electron passing through a very small diameter (less than 3 nm) of a nanocrystal [
