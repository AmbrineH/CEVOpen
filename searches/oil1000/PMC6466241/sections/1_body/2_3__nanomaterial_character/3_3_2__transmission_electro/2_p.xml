<p class="p">A beam of electron emitted by the emitter can pass from the two condensers, which make the beam thin, small and coherent. Just before the interaction of the electron beam with the sample, all the high angle electrons are removed by the condenser aperture. The interaction of the beam of the electron leads to the determination of some scattered and unscattered electrons [

An important precaution to be taken into consideration when performing TEM measurements on nanoparticles containing samples is that they can be susceptible to the highly energetic electron beam of the TEM instrument. Beam susceptibility makes it very difficult sometimes to carry out electron diffraction studies on certain nanoparticles.
