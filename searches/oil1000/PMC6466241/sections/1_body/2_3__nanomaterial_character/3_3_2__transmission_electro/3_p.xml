<p class="p">The preparation of a sample for TEM is a complex process. The sample must be very thin as the electrons are directly transmitted through the sample; therefore, the sample size is generally less than 150 nm. If a very high resolution is required, then it must be even below 30 nm. Chen and Wagner [

Then, using the spraying process, the average particle size was reached around 5 nm or less, and a sample was then dissolved in water. The images were then taken using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.
