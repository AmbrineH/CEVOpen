<p class="p">AFM can also be used to measure other properties, such as an image, often with similarly high resolution. Examples of such properties are mechanical properties, such as stiffness or adhesion strength, and electrical properties, such as conductivity or surface potential. In fact, most SPM techniques are extensions of AFM that use this modality.</p>
