<p class="p">AFM has three strengths: force measurement, imaging and manipulation. In force measurement, the measurement of the forces between the sample and the probe is conducted by AFM as a function of their mutual separation. This can be applied to perform force spectroscopy to measure the mechanical properties of the sample, such as the sample’s Young’s modulus, a measure of stiffness.</p>
