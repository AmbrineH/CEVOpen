<p class="p">For imaging, the probe reaction towards the force applied by the sample is used to form the topography (three-dimensional shape) at a very high resolution of the sample surface. This could be attained by raster scanning the positions of the sample with respect to the height and the tip of the probe that accords with constant probe sample interactions.</p>
