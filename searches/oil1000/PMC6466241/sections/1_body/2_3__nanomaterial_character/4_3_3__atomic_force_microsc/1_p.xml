<p class="p">The atomic force microscope (AFM) is a scanning probe microscope, which is designed to measure local properties. The local properties are friction, magnetism and height. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) scans over the small area of the sample, measuring the local properties. It is a very-high-resolution type of SPM, with a demonstrated resolution in the order of fractions of a nanometre, more than 1000 times better than the optical diffraction limit [
