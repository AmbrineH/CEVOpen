<p class="p">The interaction of atoms when a beam of incident electron strikes the surface of the sample lead to the formation of secondary electrons, back-scattered electrons, diffracted electrons, and specific X-rays, which considerably depend on the surface morphology, topography and chemical constituent [

SEM also uses specific X-rays and back-scattered electrons from the sample to form an image and to detect the elemental structure of the sample [
