<p class="p">Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a powerful electron microscope and a popular surface imaging technique. It images the surface of the sample by using electron high-energy beam scanning. SEM magnifies the image by using electrons rather than the light used by conventional microscopes. Sometimes, there is no clear differentiation between the nanoparticles of the sample, predominantly when the nanoparticles are inclined to agglomerate. The resolution of the image by SEM depends on the interaction of the specimen with the electron beam (
