<p class="p">In classical SEM, a beam of monochromatic electrons, induced by the emitter, are condensed and accelerated by the accelerating anode [
 <xref rid="B29-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. These streaming electrons are then deflected to the magnetic lens, which make them thinner and more coherent [
 <xref rid="B32-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Further, these beams are passed through the scanning coil, which scan in a grid approach over the surface of the sample. The surface of the sample must be conductive for the beam of the electron to study the surface of the sample by SEM. The interaction of the sample and the electron beam generate secondary electrons, back-scattered electrons, x-rays, visible rays, absorbed electrons and diffracted electron. These numerous electrons containing information about the sample are detected and visualised on a screen. Secondary electrons are more sensitive for the lighter elements then the back-scattered electrons. Zhou et al. [
