<p class="p">SEM gives a highly magnified three-dimensional image with a very high resolution. SEM is used to image the surface structure of the nanocomposite polymer, nanoparticles, nanofibers and nanocoating on the surfaces [
 <xref rid="B29-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. SEM also gives information regarding the purity of the sample. Moreover, it gives the degree of aggregation and determines the position of the secondary and tertiary nanostructure. SEM gives us the degree of dispersion of the nanoparticles on the sample. SEM application could be limited as the electron beam can damage the polymer of the nanoparticles. They also frequently require information about the sizing distribution [
