 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles as a vitamin carrier system by using SEM. They casted nanoparticles on the microscope slide, fixed in the specimen stub and then used a very thin gold coating to avoid charging under the electron beam. The SEM images revealed the smooth and spherical morphology of the nanoparticles with regular distribution over the surface of the glass. Biddeci et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] demonstrated a biopolymer film formed by pectin matrix with modified halloysite nanotubes containing essential peppermint oil and possessing thermosensitive antimicrobial properties. The SEM images in their study indicated that the halloysite tubular shape is conserved in the functionalised halloysite nanotube.
