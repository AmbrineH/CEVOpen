<p class="p">Smart and active packaging systems, also referred as the intelligent packaging systems, are used to pack food and products in order to enhance desired attributes such as monitored transport and storage, increasing the shelf life of food, scrutinising freshness and releasing antimicrobial agents in order to reduce food contamination and spoilage. Bioengineered food packaging materials are closely related to intelligent, active and smart packaging [
 <xref rid="B67-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Small sachets or packets of metals or their oxides, such as gold, silver, silica, aluminium oxide, zinc oxide, iron oxide, etc., are incorporated into the packaging. In many packaging systems, silver, nano zinc oxide and nano magnesium oxide have been used as antimicrobial agents. They have claimed to be active agents, as they inhibit microbial growth for a longer period of time. Nanostructure porous silicon food packaging enables the detection of pathogens and variations of temperature during food storage. Moreover, the development of next-generation packaging displays that include radio frequency identification display (RFID) as smart labels to assist in the quick and accurate distribution of foodstuffs with a limited shelf life.
