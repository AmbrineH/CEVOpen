<p class="p">Packaging can also be made smart by inducing a nano-sensor. Nano-sensors are tiny sensors attached either to food or food packaging. They can detect pathogenic bacteria, viruses and chemical contaminants in the food system [
 <xref rid="B68-bioengineering-06-00026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. They are highly efficient as one sensor can identify a wide range of pathogens. Nano-sensor research is focused on the rapid detection of contaminants in and around food and the tracking of food by the incorporation of a nano-sensor in the food packaging material.
