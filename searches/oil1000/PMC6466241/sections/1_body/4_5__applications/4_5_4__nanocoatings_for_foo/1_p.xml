<p class="p">Nanomaterial coating on food surfaces exhibits high-performance abilities for resisting the development of biofilm. Nanoparticles are used for the functionalisation and the controlled release of antimicrobial agents from surfaces, reducing the colonisation of the microorganisms, as well as inhibiting their propagation. These nanostructured materials are effective for a longer duration, prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria and avoid food spoilage. Various nanoparticles, such as gold, silver, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and many more, have been studied as a coating for several food contact materials. Yemmireddy et al. developed a nanocoating of TiO
