<p class="p">The development of nanotechnology in the food industry have led to the development of edible nano-coatings of about 5 nm thickness. Thin edible nano-coatings are created on the outer surface of fresh fruits and vegetables, raw meat, cheese, ready-to-eat foods and bakery goods. It acts as an obstruction to the exchange of gases and moisture that releases antioxidants, enzymes, flavour, colour and antimicrobial agents. This coating helps in the protection of food from spoilage and, hence, increases the shelf life of the food. Many edible coatings have been developed for fresh fruits and vegetables and raw meat. Dhital et al. developed an edible coating on “Chandler” strawberries to increase their shelf life [
