<p class="p">Food is a necessity of life, which provides us the energy to sustain life. The healthier the food, the more energy it will produce and maintain the metabolism. Nanotechnology works on the nanoscale level to introduce the nutritive components into food to make it healthier and safer. Nanoparticles could be incorporated in the food industry in any sector, such as processing, packaging, storage, transport, safety and quality improvement and security. Nano-nutritional supplements incorporated in food work with high efficacy. These particles are more easily accepted by cells of the body due to their size and surface morphologies. In contrast, there has always been a conflict between studies regarding the applications of nanotechnology in the food industry and the impact of nanoparticles on the health. Therefore, legislation has been developed on the use of nanotechnology in the food sector. Many nanofoods have been produced and commercialised in the market as a nutraceutical or food supplement. Nanotechnology is also used to enhance nutritive value, smart packaging, nano-sensing application and antimicrobial agents in the food system.</p>
