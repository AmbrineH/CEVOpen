<p class="p">Spectroscopy is used to study the interaction of a nanoparticle with electromagnetic radiations as the function of wavelength. In some cases, it is also used to characterise the concentration, shape and size of nanostructured material. By using the principle of light scattering or the absorbance of light of different wavelengths, such as X-rays, laser light, ultraviolet light and visible light, a nanoparticle’s size, shape, concentration and composition can be determined. The spectroscopic techniques that are mainly used are Raman spectroscopy, UV—Vis spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), dynamic light scattering spectroscopy (DLS), Zeta potential spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy.</p>
