<p class="p">Microscopic technique is used to characterise the size, shape and location of NPs. The size distribution of NPs is expressed in mass and in number by producing an image of the individual nanoparticles. Elementary optical microscopy cannot be used to characterise a nanoparticle, as the size of a nanoparticle is below the diffraction limits of the visible light. Therefore, electron microscopy techniques and scanning probe microscopy are the prevailing methods. These microscopy methods sometime require the sample to be in the vacuum dried form or in probe tip geometry, which may cause the destruction of the sample. The microscopic methods mainly used to characterise nanoparticles are scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM).</p>
