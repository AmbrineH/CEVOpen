<p class="p">Nanotechnology is of significant importance to the food industry as they provides the opportunity to create novel structure that enhances the texture, taste and the quality of food. The NPs (simple matrix, core shell, dispersion or combination) can be used in food industry in the form of nanotubes, nanoliposome, nanoemulsions, nanolaminate, nanocomposites, nanospheres, nanocapsules and nanofibers [

Nanomaterials incorporated into food could introduce or enhance the availability of principle nutrients, increase the shelf life, enhance the flavour and colour, develop new smart and intelligent packaging systems and improve safety and food traceability to monitor food during storage and transport.
