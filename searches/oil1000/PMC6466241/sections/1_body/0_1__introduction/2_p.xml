<p class="p">Based on physical and chemical properties, the characterisation of a nanoparticle is carried out using different analytical techniques. It is necessary to characterise a nanoparticle in order to understand its structure and its interaction with the environment and to study its nanotoxicological properties and to gauge their safety when applying NPs to a food system. The influence of physical properties, such as size, shape, crystallinity, state of dispersion and the surface properties, effects health on exposure to the nanoparticle. A nanoparticle is usually characterised by using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.</p>
