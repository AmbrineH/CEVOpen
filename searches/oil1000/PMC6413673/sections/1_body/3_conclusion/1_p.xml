<p class="p">We found that infection of olive plants by the defoliating pathotype of 
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> apart from reducing olive fruit yield promoted an increase in the synthesis of C6 volatile compounds and a decrease in C5 compounds that are the main contributors to VOO aroma. Plant infection led to a reduction in the synthesis of the main phenolic compounds responsible for the taste sensory characteristics of VOO. There was a separation of oils from D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infected and non-infected trees, especially when considering the metabolites that really contribute to VOO flavor. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the effect of Verticillium wilt infection on volatile compounds and phenolics responsible for VOO flavor. Future work integrating changes in plant metabolites combined with sensory evaluation are necessary to decipher the plant response to 
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infection and the sensory quality of VOO.
