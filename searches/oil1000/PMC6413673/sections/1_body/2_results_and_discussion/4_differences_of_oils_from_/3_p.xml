<p class="p">The contribution of each volatile compound to the aroma of VOO is dependent on its concentration and odor threshold. We found that only a few volatile compounds were present at levels where they contributed to oil aroma (OAV &gt; 1) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We used PLS-DA to analyze volatile compounds with OAV &gt; 1 and 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA as compounds responsible for the pungent and bitter taste notes of the oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The selected volatile compounds are desirable for VOO aroma, except pent-1-en-3-one (5C-1) that creates unpleasant sensory profiles, according to literature (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Angerosa et al., 2000</xref>). PLS-DA analysis showed a clear separation of VOO obtained from D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infected and non-infected trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref>). We assessed the accuracy of our predictive model using the leave-one-out cross-validation method and randomized permutations, and found that there was discrimination between VOO obtained from D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infected and non-infected trees (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), where components 1 and 2 explained 56% of the variation in content of compounds responsible for oil flavor notes, supporting the observed results from the analysis of all compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>). The loadings plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref>) clearly separates desirable and undesirable compounds: vectors for phenols responsible for the bitter and pungent notes (3,4- DHPEA-EA and 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EDA) and the only non-desirable volatile compound (pent-1-en-3-one, 5C-1) are located in the plot quadrants that correspond to the negative component 1 axis. In contrast, the area with positive component 1 is, according to the literature, more related to pleasant flavor notes and contains (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-hex-2-enal (6C4) as well as some of the esters responsible for the fruity odor notes (E-1, E-2, E-3) and 3-methyl-butanal (BC-1). Oils obtained from trees infected with D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> are located along the positive component 1 axis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref>, indicating they create more desirable flavor than the oils from non-infected trees. Changes in essential oil composition due to pathogen infection have been reported in some

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smitha and Rana, 2015</xref>). PLS-DA ranked 15 metabolites by VIP score (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5C</xref>), and showed the only non-desirable volatile compound, pent-1-en-3-one (5C-1), had the highest VIP score and was discriminated by treatment, while the main compounds responsible for aroma, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-hex-2-enal (6C4) and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-hex-3-en-1-yl acetate (E-3), and the two phenolics (3,4- DHPEA-EA and 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EDA) had lower, although moderate, VIP values.
