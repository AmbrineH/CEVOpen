<p class="p">In general, hierarchical clustering analysis using all volatile and phenolic compounds differentiated oils obtained from infected olive trees from those obtained from non-infected control trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). There was a trend to group the oils from non-infected trees by soil type, where oil from plants grown in the sandy-loam (SL) formed a distinct cluster to oils obtained from those grown in loam (L) and clay-loam (CL) soils (

This general trend of differentiating the VOO obtained from Verticillium wilt infected or non-infected trees was kept when hierarchical clustering analysis was run only with the volatile compounds or with the phenolic compounds, with only a few exceptions (
