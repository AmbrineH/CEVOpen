<p class="p">Moderate to low disease symptoms, characterized as early dropping of symptomless, green leaves, and necrosis and death of some main branches, started to develop in plants inoculated with the D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> V138I isolate two months after inoculation. Symptom severity increased during the growing season, reaching a maximum in early summer. Control plants did not develop Verticillium wilt symptoms during the experiment. Maximum disease severity was observed in July, and was greater in plants grown in sandy-loam soil (severity score: 1.9) than in clay-loam (severity score: 0.92) and loam (severity score: 0.38) soils (
