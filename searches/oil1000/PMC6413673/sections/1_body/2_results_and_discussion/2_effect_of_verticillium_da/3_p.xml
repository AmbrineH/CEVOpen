<p class="p">Oil content of esters synthesized through the LOX pathway (LOX esters) is commercially important because they are the main contributors to oil fruitiness that are evaluated in the regulated sensory analysis for commercial grading. Among them, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-hex-3-en-1-yl acetate (E3) may be the most important due to its higher content and lower odor threshold than other esters, such as hexyl acetate (E1) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-hex-2-en-1-yl acetate (E2) (
