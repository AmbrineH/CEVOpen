<p class="p">In addition to assessing impacts of 
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infection on yield, we analyzed its effect on volatile and phenolic fractions that are related to the sensory quality of the VOO. In general, 
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> inoculation affected significantly (

 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infection by the D-pathotype induced a significant increase (
