<p class="p">There are four main groups of olive oil phenolics, comprising compounds that contain tyrosol (
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA) or its hydroxyl derivative hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA) in their molecules, lignans, flavonoids, and an array of simple phenolic acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Our finding that tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol derivatives were the most abundant phenolics in the oils, especially those with a secoiridoid chemical structure, such as the aldehydic forms 3,4-DHPEA-EA and 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EA, and the dialdehydic forms 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EDA, supports previous findings for the olive cultivar (“Picual”) used in the study (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">García-Rodríguez et al., 2017</xref>). On average, the most abundant were secoiridoids derived from hydroxytyrosol, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, and 3,4-DHPEA-EA. In general, we found that infection of olive trees with D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> led to oils with a significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.007) lower content of phenolic compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), as a result of reductions in content of tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol derivatives, whereas the soil type only have an influence on 3,4-DHPEA and 3,4-DHPEA acetate (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Unlike the content of the C6 volatiles, average content of the tyrosol derivatives in oil from infected trees was 22% lower (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.007) than those from the non-infected control trees, and content of the hydroxytyrosol derivatives 17% lower. In contrast, the remaining main phenolic groups in the oils (flavonoids and lignans) were unaffected by D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> tree infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Thus, there were contrasting effects of D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infection on the content of volatile compounds and phenolics. In young

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bate and Rothstein (1998)</xref> demonstrated that 2-hexenal induces several genes known to be involved in the defense response of the plant, such as those related to the phenylpropanoids pathway that leads to the production of anthocyanins. This greater use of phenylalanine in the synthesis of phenylpropanoids and anthocyanins may explain a lower availability for the synthesis of secoiridoid compounds that are produced, in part, from the hydroxylated derivatives of phenylalanine tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine (
