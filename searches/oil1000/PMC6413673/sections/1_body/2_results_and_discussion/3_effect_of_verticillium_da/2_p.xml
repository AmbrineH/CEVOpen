<p class="p">Among the oil phenolics, 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA have been shown drive the taste properties of VOO. We found that average content of 
 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EDA (oleocanthal), which is likely to be the main phenolic responsible for VOO pungency (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andrewes et al., 2003</xref>), was 25% lower (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.009) in the oils from D-
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic> infected trees, and it is likely there would be an associated lowered perception of pungency in these oils. Similarly, content of 3,4-DHPEA-EA, which may be a key compound for bitterness in VOO (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mateos et al., 2004</xref>), was almost 20% lower (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.018) in oils of infected trees. 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mateos et al. (2004)</xref> developed an equation that includes oil content of 3,4-DHPEA-EA to calculate VOO bitterness; according to this calculation, we estimated that average perception of bitterness was around 17% lower in oils obtained from infected trees.
