<p class="p">Phenolic compounds were isolated from the oils using solid phase extraction, as described by 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mateos et al. (2001)</xref>. A solution of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (46.4 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-coumaric acid (9.6 μg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in methanol was used as internal standard, which was added (0.5 mL) to each oil sample (2.5 g) before the extraction procedure. Methanol was evaporated in a rotary vacuum evaporator at 40°C and the residue was dissolved in 6 mL of hexane. A diol-bonded phase cartridge (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, United States) was conditioned by passing first 6 mL of methanol and then 6 mL of hexane. The oil solution was loaded onto the column and the solvent was pulled through. Then, the phase was washed twice with 3 mL of hexane and 4 mL of hexane/ethyl acetate (90:10, v/v). Finally, the phenolics were eluted from the cartridge with 10 mL of methanol, and the solvent was evaporated in a rotary vacuum evaporator at 40°C. The residue was dissolved in 500 μL of methanol/water (1:1, v/v), which constituted the VOO phenolics extract. Phenolics extracts were analyzed using a Beckman Coulter liquid chromatographic system equipped with a diode array detector (System Gold 168) and a Mediterranea Sea 18 column (internal diameter: 4.0 × 250 mm; particle size: 5 μm) (Teknokroma, Barcelona, Spain) (after 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Luaces et al., 2007</xref>). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, using water/phosphoric acid (99.5:0.5) (solvent A) and methanol/acetonitrile (50:50) (solvent B) as the mobile phases and the following elution program: (A) 0–25 min, 5–30% solvent B; (B) 25–35 min, 30–38% solvent B; 35–40 min, 38% solvent B; 40–45 min, 38–100% solvent B. Two phenolic extracts were isolated from each oil sample and duplicate analyses were carried out for each phenolic extract. Quantification of phenols and lignans was done at 280 nm except for ferulic acid, while flavones and ferulic acid quantification was carried out at 335 nm. Response factors (Rf) were used for each phenolic compound as stated by 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mateos et al. (2001)</xref> [concentration (μg g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) = Rf × area compound/area internal standard]. Compounds were identified according to their UV–Vis spectra, and confirmed using HPLC/ESI-qTOF-HRMS with available standards on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS U-HPLC liquid chromatograph system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), equipped with a 3-μm particle size Mediterranea Sea 18 column and operated for mass analysis using a micrOTOF-QII High Resolution Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer with qQ-TOF geometry (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization interface. Mass spectra were obtained in MS full scan mode. Data were processed using TargetAnalysis 1.2 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
