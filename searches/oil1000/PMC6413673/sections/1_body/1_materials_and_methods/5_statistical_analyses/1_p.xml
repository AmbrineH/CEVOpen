 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chong et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, data on disease development, fruit yield, and metabolite quantification were subjected to standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the GLM procedure in SAS. Data were tested for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test and transformed if needed to obtain normal distributions. All analysis followed a factorial design in a randomized complete block design; the factors were inoculation treatment (
