<p class="p">Three different soil types (loam, clay-loam, and sandy-loam) were selected as representative of the different soil types commonly found in Andalusia, southern Spain, the main olive growing area in the world with more that 1.5 million hectares, producing more than one-third of the world’s olive oil (

Since we could not repeat the experiment in different locations the use of three soils with different physicochemical properties could overcome part of this limitation. Each soil used was thoroughly mixed in a cement mixer to ensure homogeneity of each soil before use. We used a monoconidial
