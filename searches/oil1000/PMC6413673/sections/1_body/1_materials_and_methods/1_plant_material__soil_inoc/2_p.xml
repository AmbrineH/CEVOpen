<p class="p">For the experiment we selected the cultivar “Picual”, the most important olive cultivar in the world, representing 50% of the olives trees in Spain and therefore, approximately 20% worldwide, which is highly susceptible to the D-pathotype of 
 <italic class="italic">V. dahliae</italic>. In March, we transplanted single, 1-m tall, 18-month-old “Picual” plants to 40-L pots containing one of the three types of infested or non-infested soils. Pots were buried in a field plot at the Institute of Sustainable Agriculture, Córdoba, Spain, to maintain soil temperature at a level similar to that in field soil, and plants were grown under standard drip irrigation and fertilization conditions. There were a total of 50 and 25 replicates of inoculated and non-inoculated plants, respectively, which were arranged in a completely randomized block design in five blocks within the experimental plot (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, 10 and five inoculated and non-inoculated plants, respectively, per block). Disease incidence in plants was assessed monthly, as the proportion of plants showing disease symptoms, and severity of foliar symptoms was assessed using a 0 to 4 rating scale, according to the proportion of affected leaves and twigs (
