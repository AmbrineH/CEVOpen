<p class="p">Verticillium wilt, caused by the defoliating pathotype of 
 <italic class="italic">Verticillium dahliae</italic>, is the most devastating soil-borne fungal disease of olive trees (
 <italic class="italic">Olea europaea</italic> L.). The disease is widely distributed in all Mediterranean olive-growing regions, and is one of the major limiting factors of olive oil production (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2012</xref>). Losses from Verticillium wilt include high rates of tree mortality and reductions in fruit yield, especially in highly susceptible cultivars. Tree death tends to occur in young orchards infected by the defoliating pathotype, but adult trees are also affected, while reductions in fruit yield occur with nonlethal infections that cause drupes to shrivel, desiccate, and lose weight (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2012</xref>). In Israel, yield reductions in irrigated “Picual” olives were estimated to be 75 and 89% at 3 and 5 years after planting, respectively (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Levin et al., 2003</xref>). However, other than effects on crop yield, little is known about the effect of Verticillium wilt on oil quality obtained from infected olive trees.
