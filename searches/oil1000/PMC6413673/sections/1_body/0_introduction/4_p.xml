<p class="p">Phenolics in VOO are responsible for bitterness and pungency that are common and desirable attributes when present at low to moderate intensities (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mateos et al., 2004</xref>); however, consumers reject oils with high levels of phenolics. VOO phenolics belong to four main chemical classes: secoiridoids, lignans, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Within these, there is a wide array of phenolic profiles that varies with cultivar, edaphic and climatic conditions, and type of industrial process used during olive oil extraction (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">García-González et al., 2010</xref>). The secoiridoid glucosides, which are especially abundant in the Oleaceae (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gariboldi et al., 1986</xref>), act as defense chemicals against herbivores and pathogens due to their antifeedant and growth inhibitory activities against insects. In olive fruit tissue, dominant secoiridoid glucosides, such as oleuropein, ligstroside, and demethyloleuropein, are substrates for phenolic synthesis through the activity of different hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes during the oil extraction process (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">García-Rodríguez et al., 2011</xref>), resulting in the formation of secoiridoid aglucones that comprise phenolic alcohol tyrosol (

 <italic class="italic">p-</italic>HPEA-EDA, respectively) and aldehydic forms of oleuropein and ligstroside aglucones (3,4-DHPEA-EA and
