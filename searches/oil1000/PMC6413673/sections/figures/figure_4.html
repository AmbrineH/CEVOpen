 <p> (A) Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) 2D score plot of oils extracted from olive trees grown in three different soils (L: loam; CL: clay-loam; and, SL: sandy-loam) infected (Vd) and non-infected (control) by D- Verticillium dahliae. Red: control; Green: V. dahliae inoculated trees. The model was established using three principal components; explained variance is in parentheses. (B) Loading importance of metabolites in the first PLS-DA component. Colored boxes (red: control; green: V. dahliae inoculated trees) indicate relative concentrations of the corresponding metabolite in each group. </p>
