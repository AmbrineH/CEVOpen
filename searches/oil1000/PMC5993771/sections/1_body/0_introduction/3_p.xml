<p class="p">Sperm cells are known to be more vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during oxidative stress, than somatic cells due to gametes cell structure and their limited contents of antioxidants. In this respect, the phospholipidic fraction of spermatozoa cell membranes [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] is the first target of ROS with negative effects on membrane fluidity and the subsequent impairment of motility, acrosome reaction, and sperm-egg interaction [
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Accordingly, high membrane concentration in PUFA makes sperm cells more susceptible to lipid peroxidation, especially, during the different stages of 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> storage at low temperatures compromising, thus fertility outputs [
