After 6 h of storage, highly significant differences were observed for VCL (p&lt;0.01), VSL (p&lt;0.01), and VAP (p&lt;0.01) in 8.7 µg/ml treatment with 57.07±0.62, 14.23±0.26, and 29.31±0.34 μm/s, respectively. This positive impact was maintained at 24 and 48 h. Similarly, ALH and BCF showed the highest values in 87 and 8.7 µg/ml treatments.
