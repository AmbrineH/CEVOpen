<p class="p">According to the results of this study, the use of small concentrations 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> might be beneficial to rooster spermatozoa under 4°C conditions. In fact, total and progressive motility and kinematics parameters were significantly preserved in 87 and 8.7 µg/ml treatments. After 24 h of storage, the percentage of progressive gamete was 43.25 and 63.08 at 87 and 8.7 µg/ml treatments, respectively, compared to 26.86±2.36% of the control group. Elmi

 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported that the total and progressive motility was significantly altered from the concentration of 0.8 mg/ml of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> essential oil in swine spermatozoa. This concentration was almost identical to the spermicidal concentration used in our experiment (870 µg/ml). At 0.2 mg/ml, the authors observed motility values similar to those of the control group. Conversely, when used as supplementation diet,
