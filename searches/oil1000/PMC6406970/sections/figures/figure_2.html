 <p> Survival of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( A– C) inoculated in edible coating apples (apples prior to the gastrointestinal challenge were maintained at 4 °C for 24 h) during exposure to simulated gastrointestinal system ( A-saliva; B-gastric fluid (pH 1.5); C-intestinal fluid and bile). Data are the mean of three independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Significant survival differences * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, ns, not significant. The bars show significant differences between the edible coatings. ALG-Alginate, EUG-Eugenol, CIT-Citral. </p>
