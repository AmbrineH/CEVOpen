 <p> Survival of Listeria monocytogenes 12.04 ( A– C) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( D– F) inoculated in edible coating apples (apples prior to the gastrointestinal challenge were maintained at 4 °C for 24 h) during exposure to simulated gastrointestinal system ( A, D-saliva; B, E-gastric fluid (pH 2.5); C, F-intestinal fluid and bile). Data are the mean of three independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Significant survival differences * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, ns, not significant. The bars show significant differences between the edible coatings. ALG-Alginate, EUG-Eugenol, CIT-Citral. </p>
