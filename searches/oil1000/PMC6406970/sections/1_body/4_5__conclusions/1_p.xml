<p class="p">The results of this study show that 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salm.</italic> Typhimurium may persist on the surface of the cv ’Bravo de Esmolfe’ for several days, compromising their safe consumption and the following processing. The use of edible coatings enriched with Eug or the combination of Eug and Cit are useful tools to impair the survival of both pathogens on fresh-cut apples. In addition, our study shows for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that their use increases the susceptibility of the pathogens in a manner that reduces their capacity to overcome the gastrointestinal stress. Altogether these results evidence that edible coatings enriched with essential oil components can significantly contribute to a safer consumption of minimally processed fruits.
