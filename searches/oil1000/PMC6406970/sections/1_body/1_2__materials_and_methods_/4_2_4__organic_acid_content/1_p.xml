<p class="p">The organic acid composition and quantification were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a diode array detector (DAD). Five grams of the pulp was collected from five fruits and the samples were freeze-dried. The freeze-dried samples were maintained at −80 °C until their analysis. An aliquot of 50 ± 0.5 mg was diluted in 3 ml of Milli-Q water. The mixture was vigorously mixed in a vortex followed by 5 min rest [

The collected filtrate was analyzed on a HPLC binary pump system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD, L-2455, Elite LaChrom series, Hitachi, Japan) with a multiple wavelength detector, degasser, and cooled autosampler. The filtered sample extract (20 µL) was injected into a Purospher Star RP-18 column (4.6 mm diameter × 250 mm, 5 µm particle size; Merck Millipore, Germany) with an organic acid guard column (LiChroCART 4-4 Merck Millipore, Germany). The temperature of the column was set to 35 °C using a thermostated column compartment (L-2300, Elite LaChrom series, Hitachi, Japan). The mobile phase used was 0.2% HPLC-grade aqueous metaphosphoric acid at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Non-volatile organic acids were detected at 210 nm and quantified using linear standard curves (0.01–2.5 mg/mL; average R2 = 0.99).
