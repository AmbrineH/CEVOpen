<p class="p">The impact of the edible coatings on the survival of the bacterial cells exposed to simulated gastrointestinal fluids was evaluated using the edible coating sodium alginate (2%) with 0.2% Eug and the sodium alginate (2%) with 0.1% (v/v) of Eug and 0.15% (v/v) of Cit. The experiment was done with the cv ‘Bravo de Esmolfe’. Fruits with no edible coating were used as a control. The application of the edible coatings was done as described above. Before the challenge with the simulated gastrointestinal juices, the fruits were maintained at 4 °C for 24 h to reproduce a more realistic commercial condition. </p>
