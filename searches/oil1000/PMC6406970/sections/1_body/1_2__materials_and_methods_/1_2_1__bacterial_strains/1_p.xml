<p class="p">The tested strains were 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> 12.04 (serovar 1/2b) a salad isolate (a gift from the Centre National de Référence des Listeria, Institut Pasteur, France (CLIP 88411)) and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The bacterial strains were recovered from storage at −80 °C in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) and maintained at 4 °C. Preceding each assay, the bacterial cells were transferred to fresh TSA plates and incubated at 30 °C during 18–24 h. The pre-inoculum culture was prepared by transferring a loopful of the previous TSA plate into 10 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB), which was incubated overnight at 30 °C in a shaking water-bath at 120 rpm.
