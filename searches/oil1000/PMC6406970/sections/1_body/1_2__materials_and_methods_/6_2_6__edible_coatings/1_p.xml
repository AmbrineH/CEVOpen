<p class="p">The formulation of the edible coatings based on sodium alginate (2%) was done as previously described [

 <xref rid="B25-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The edible coatings were supplemented with eugenol (Eug) or a combination of citral (Cit) and Eug. The concentrations of the essential oil components were selected based on previously determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Eug and Cit [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The tested edible coatings were 1) sodium alginate (2%) with 0.2% Eug, 2) sodium alginate (2%) with 0.1% (v/v) of Eug, and 0.15% of Cit. For the application of the edible coatings, the fruits were previously disinfected with 70% ethanol and dried in a laminar flow chamber. Afterward, each fruit was sliced and the slices were transferred to sterile Petri dishes. Each slice was inoculated with 10 μL (10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> CFU/mL) of the previously prepared bacterial culture in an area of 1 × 1 cm. After that, each slice was firstly immersed in a solution of ascorbic acid (1%) (Fisher Chemical) for 1 min to avoid browning and then transferred to the edible coating solution for 2 min and finally dipped in a CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1%) solution (Panreac) during 1 min for cross-linking. The fruits were then maintained at 4 °C. Fruits with no edible coating were used as a control. The experiment was done in triplicate. The viability was determined as described above.
