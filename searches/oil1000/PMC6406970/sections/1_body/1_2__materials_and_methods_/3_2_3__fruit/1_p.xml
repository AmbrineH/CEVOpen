<p class="p">In this study two apple cultivars were used, the 
 <italic class="italic">Malus domestica</italic> Borkh. cv. Bravo de Esmolfe, a Portuguese apple cultivar produced in northern Portugal, and the commercial cv. Golden Delicious. Fruits of cv. Bravo de Esmolfe and Golden Delicious were purchased in the local market at the eating-ripe stage, in conditions to be processed as fresh-cut. The fruits were selected for uniformity of size and absence of flaws.
