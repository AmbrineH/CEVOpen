<p class="p">The use of edible coatings with incorporated essential oils has shown to be an efficient method to extend the shelf life of different fruits [

 <xref rid="B31-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The use of alginate edible coating enriched with eugenol or a combination of eugenol and citral has been previously demonstrated to efficiently preserve fresh-cut ‘Bravo de Esmolfe’ apple with a good sensory appreciation [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In our study, we show that the use of alginate edible coating supplemented with eugenol or a combination of eugenol and citral not only can improve the shelf life of apples but also impair the survival of two important foodborne pathogens improving the safety of these fruits. Interesting fresh-cut apples of the cv ‘Bravo de Esmolfe’ endured a lower survival of both 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium, in comparison to the cv ‘Golden Delicious’. This difference between the two cultivars may be related with the lower pH of the ‘Bravo de Esmolfe’ apples but also to components that were not in the present study investigated, such as the presence of phenols and terpenoids in the composition of this cultivar [

 <xref rid="B34-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Citral targets both the cytoplasmic and the outer membrane of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> cells [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], and alters the fatty acid composition of the membrane of several bacteria, including

 <xref rid="B37-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. On the other hand, organic acids present in fruits can also act against bacterial cells, such activity has been associated with their lipid permeability and the consequent discharge of protons. Moreover, smaller the undissociated molecules of organic acids can more easily cross the bacterial membrane affecting a series of vital events, such as disturbing the intracellular pH, the membrane function, increasing the osmolarity to fatal turgor pressure, and finally disrupting essential metabolic pathways [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of these organic acids, in particular, malic acid has been explored as a preservative in fresh producing in apples [
