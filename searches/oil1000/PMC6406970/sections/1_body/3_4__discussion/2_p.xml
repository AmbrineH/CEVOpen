<p class="p">Apples are characterized by a significant diversity of organic acids in their composition, with malic acid being the main organic acid [

 <xref rid="B29-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The two apple cultivars showed similar levels of oxalic, malic, and quinic organic acids. However, the pH value was different between the two cultivars. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that the pH value can vary according to the conditions of plant growth, and it is expected that some variation on this parameter can be found, for instances in the study of Alegre et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-08-00057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] ’Golden Delicious’ apples showed a pH value of 4.16, a lower pH than the one found in our study. Fructose was the main sugar found in both cultivars. This is in agreement with other reported studies [
