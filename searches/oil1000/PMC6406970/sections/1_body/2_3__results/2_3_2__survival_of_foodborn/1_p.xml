<p class="p">The ability of the two foodborne pathogens to survive on the surface of the apples was estimated using the cv “Bravo de Esmolfe”. The survival of

 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> 12.04 showed a higher ability to survive on the surface of the fruits in comparison to 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The percentage of viable cells of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> 12.04 after the first day of storage at 20 °C was 81.2 ± 10.30%, in contrast, the viability of 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC 14028, in the same time interval, was 56.38 ± 8.90%. After seven days of storage, the difference between the survival of the two foodborne pathogens was even more pronounced, 73.64 ± 3.48% of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> 12.04 cells were viable, in comparison to 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 for which no cells were recovered after the same period of time.
