<p class="p">The experiment using a lower pH of the gastric fluid (pH 1.5) showed the highest susceptibility of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> exposed to both edible coatings as no cells were recovered after the challenge with the gastrointestinal fluids, in contrast, to the control cells that were able to survive. After 2 h of exposure to the gastric juice 55.07 ± 7.82% of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> cells from the control apples were recovered, and after 2 h of exposure to the simulated intestinal medium the viability achieved 50.95 ± 5.06%. In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">Salm.</italic> Typhimurium showed to be more resistant to the gastrointestinal challenge. Nevertheless, the use of edible coating supplemented with essential oil components impaired the survival of 
 <italic class="italic">Salm.</italic> Typhimurium during the gastrointestinal challenge (

 <italic class="italic">Salm.</italic> Typhimurium was significantly lower (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when 0.1% Eug and 0.15% Cit was used (

 <italic class="italic">Salm.</italic> Typhimurium was equally lower in the presence of both edible coatings in comparison to the control cells (
