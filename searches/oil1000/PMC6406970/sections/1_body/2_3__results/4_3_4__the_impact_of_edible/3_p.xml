<p class="p">The exposure to saliva caused a significant reduction (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> survival when both edible coatings were used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00057-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A). In contrast, the exposure to saliva did not cause any reduction of 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium survival whatever the edible coating used, in comparison to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00057-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>D). The survival of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> during the exposure to the gastric medium (the added gastric fluid had a pH 2.5 and the final pH of the mixture of the macerated apple plus the gastrointestinal fluids was for the control 5.69 ± 0.15, for ALG + 0.2% Eug was 5.49 ± 0. 36 and for ALG + 0.1% Eug and 0.15% Cit was 5.46 ± 0.05) was significantly lower (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when the edible coating supplemented with 0.2% Eug was used, either after 1 or 2 h (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00057-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>E). The simulation of the gut environment by the addition of the artificial intestinal fluid caused the highest reduction of the survival of 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> when the edible coating with 0.2% Eug was applied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00057-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>C). Differently, the survival of 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium was more affected in the presence of the edible coating supplemented with 0.1% Eug and 0.15% Cit (
