<p class="p">The survival of the foodborne pathogens in apples with the edible coatings challenged with artificial gastrointestinal fluids was performed using the fruits of the cv “Bravo de Esmolfe”. The challenge with the simulated gastrointestinal fluids was done determining the survival of two foodborne pathogens with gastric fluid at two pH values, pH 2.5 and pH 1.5. The exposure of the foodborne pathogens in apples with edible coatings to gastrointestinal fluids was done after 24 h at 4 °C reproducing a possible commercial condition.</p>
