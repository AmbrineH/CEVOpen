<p class="p">The pH value and the main identified organic acids and sugars in the tested apple fruits are summarized in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00057-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The lowest pH value was observed in the ’Bravo de Esmolfe’ apples (4.25 ± 0.06), in contrast, the ’Golden Delicious’ apples showed a higher pH value (4.97 ± 0.04). The major identified organic acids were oxalic, malic, and quinic acid, and no significant differences (
