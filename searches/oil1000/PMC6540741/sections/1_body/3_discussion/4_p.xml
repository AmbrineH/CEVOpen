<p class="p">We have previously reported that the UOG mix has antagonist activity for estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, and thyroid hormone receptors suggesting the UOG mix may antagonize one or more of these receptors during development to alter metabolic endpoints in adulthood (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). In this study, females exposed to the 1.5 and 150 μg/kg/day 23-UOG mix had lower total and resting energy expenditure and 15 μg/kg/day had lower non-resting energy expenditure in the dark cycle. Further, females developmentally exposed to the 15 and 150 μg/kg/day 23-UOG mix had lower spontaneous activity. These effects are the opposite of the increased energy expenditure and spontaneous activity after developmental exposure to estrogen receptor agonists (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>); thus, the UOG mixture may have programmed reduced energy expenditure and spontaneous activity at 7 months of age due to estrogen receptor antagonism during development. While there is little information on the developmental effects of estrogen receptor antagonists and adult energy expenditure, depletion of estrogen receptor activity (estrogen receptor-alpha knockout and g-protein coupled estrogen receptor knockout) has been associated with lower total energy expenditure suggesting estrogen receptor activity may modulate development of energy homeostasis in adulthood (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>). Androgenic effects during gestation could elicit some of the effects reported herein; however, since the UOG mix contains anti-androgenic activity rather than agonist activity, the effects observed in the current study in 7-month-old female mice, do not appear to be mediated through AR (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). Taken together, while the lower energy expenditure and activity seen in the current study is consistent with antiestrogenic activity in the 23-UOG mixture, future studies are needed to delineate the exact developmental receptor pathways modulated by the 23-UOG mixture during development that alter adult energy expenditure.
