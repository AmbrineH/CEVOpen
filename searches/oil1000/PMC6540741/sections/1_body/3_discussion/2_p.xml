<p class="p">Hormones are essential in regulating metabolism throughout development and programming metabolic function in adulthood, and developmental exposure to EDCs has been reported to alter body composition, energy expenditure, activity, glucose homeostasis and adipogenesis (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). Developmental exposure to EDCs, including BPA, lead, arsenic, diethylstilbestrol (DES), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been associated with altered metabolism (
