<p class="p">In the current study, we report that a combined pre-conceptional, prenatal, and lactational exposure from GD 1 to PND 21 to a mixture of 23 UOG chemicals was associated with decreased body weights at PND 7 in females. Previously our lab has shown that a prenatal exposure from GD 11 to GD 18 to the same 23-UOG mixture resulted in the opposite–increased body weight at PND 7 and 21 (

Alternatively, decreased body weight at PND 7 in the current study could have been a transient acute effect from lactational exposure to the 23-UOG mixture or a result of altered maternal behavior as EDCs have been shown to disrupt maternal behavior (
