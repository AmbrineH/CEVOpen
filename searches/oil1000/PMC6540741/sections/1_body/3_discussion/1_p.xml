<p class="p">We report for the first time that developmental exposure to a mixture of 23 oil and gas chemicals altered adult energy expenditure in 7-month-old female mice, particularly in the dark cycle when mice are more active. Mice in the 15 μg/kg/day group had a lower non-resting energy expenditure. Females in the 1.5 and 150 μg/kg/day groups had lower total and resting energy expenditure within the dark cycle, and the 150 μg/kg/day group had lower spontaneous activity and tended to have lower non-resting energy expenditure in the dark cycle. This decrease in energy expenditure did not result in altered body weight or body composition at 7 months of age. This study supports the hypothesis that developmental exposure to EDCs can contribute to the programming of energy expenditure and activity in adulthood.</p>
