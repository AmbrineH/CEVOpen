<p class="p">Many factors contribute to energy balance, body composition, and body mass regulation. In this study, pre- and post-natal exposure to the 23-UOG mixture decreased total and resting energy expenditure in some UOG mix groups, but this did not result in altered body weight, lean mass, or fat mass in 7-month-old females. Although one would typically expect higher body mass or fat mass to track with lower energy expenditure, this is not always the case. For example, Wan et al. also found that AKT knockout mice displayed an increase in energy expenditure compared to control mice matched for body mass (

A limitation of indirect calorimetry is that it is taken at one point in time and does not represent energy metabolism throughout the lifespan of the animal. It is possible that the lower energy expenditure measured in the 23-UOG mixture may have led to greater body mass if mice were aged longer-a question directly assessed in a companion paper in this journal, Balise et al. (submitted). In addition, although efforts were made to reduce any stress caused by the indirect calorimetry cages by providing an acclimation period and using the same bedding as home cages, it is possible that a change to a new environment impacted control mice and 23 UOG exposed mice differently during the defined period of time. Energy homeostasis is maintained with different compensating mechanisms such as differences in digestion, skeletal muscle metabolism, adipose storage, or fecal deposition. In addition, although we carefully measured food intake at defined periods of time, it is possible that small reductions in food intake allowed 23-UOG mixture treated animals to maintain normal body mass despite reduced energy expenditure. Future long-term studies can be conducted to determine if these significant decrements in energy expenditure have long term ramifications for body mass and metabolic health. At this age, an impact on body weight might not be seen unless the system is challenged beyond compensatory mechanisms. For example, a high-fat diet or western style diet challenge has revealed underlying metabolic programming following developmental exposure to other EDCs, such as DEHP, atrazine, and BPA (
