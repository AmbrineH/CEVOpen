<p class="p">The role of androgens in metabolic dysfunction are well-appreciated, though are not likely to play a role in the observed effects herein. Acute androgen exposure is generally considered anti-adipogenic and anti-androgen exposure is adipogenic using

For example, prenatal exposure to androgen results in metabolic dysfunction in adult female rodents and monkeys, including increased body weight, adiposity, insulin, serum lipids profiles, and decreased energy expenditure (
