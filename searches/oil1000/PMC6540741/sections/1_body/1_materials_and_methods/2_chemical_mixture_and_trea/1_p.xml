<p class="p">C57BL/6 dams used in this study were 8 months old at initiation of treatment, and 9 months of age when mated. These dams were used in a previous study. Offspring outcomes from the first experiment were reported in Kassotis et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>). Each female received the same concentration of chemical mixture that was randomly assigned in the previous study (

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14, 9, 11, 8, and 10) were exposed to the chemical mixture (at concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, or 10 μg/mL, respectively) for 5 weeks prior to mating (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Chemical exposure was paused while females were mated in order to bypass the window of fertilization, and to avoid consumption of treatment chemicals by the males (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Treatment was resumed at gestational day 1 (1 day after presence of copulatory plug) and continued through weaning of the F1 generation at PND 21. “Developmental exposure” will be used throughout the manuscript to describe the inclusive exposure to the dam preconception and GD 1 to PND 21 exposure.
