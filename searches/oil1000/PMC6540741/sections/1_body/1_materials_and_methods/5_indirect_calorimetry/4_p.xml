<p class="p">Energy expenditure, activity, and behavior were assessed for a random subset of 7 animals per treatment group on the first day of estrus. Energy expenditure was calculated from measured oxygen consumption using the Kaiyala-Simple equation. Valid data (barring system malfunctions) were collected for

The first 24 h were used as an acclimation period, and the second 24 h were analyzed separately as the 12-h light cycle or the 12-h dark cycle. Oxygen consumption, energy expenditure, and activity were calculated with macros provided by the manufacturer (
