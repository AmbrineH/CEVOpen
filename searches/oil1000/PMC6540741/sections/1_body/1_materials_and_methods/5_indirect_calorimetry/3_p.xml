<p class="p">Activity and meters traveled were measured by infrared beams that track movement in horizontal (X and Y plane) and vertical directions (Z plane). Spontaneous activity was defined as activity in the X, Y, and Z directions, ambulatory activity in the X and Y directions, and rearing activity in the Z direction. Meters traveled counted all meters in the X, Y, and Z direction. Food consumption was also measured in this system.</p>
