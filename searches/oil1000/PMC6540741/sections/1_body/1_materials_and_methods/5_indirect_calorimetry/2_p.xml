<p class="p">Total energy expenditure was measured for a 12-h cycle. Resting energy expenditure was extrapolated from the lowest average energy expenditure in a 30-min window within a 12-h cycle and calculated to be representative of the resting energy expenditure for a complete 12-h period. Non-resting energy expenditure was calculated for each 12-h cycle by subtracting 12-h calculated resting energy expenditure from 12-h total energy expenditure (
