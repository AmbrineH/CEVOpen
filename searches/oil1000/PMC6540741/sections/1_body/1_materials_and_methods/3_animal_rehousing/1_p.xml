<p class="p">Female offspring at 6 months of age were transferred to an open-top conventional facility for body composition and metabolic assessments. Mice were allowed to acclimate to the new environment for a month prior to initiation of metabolic testing. This facility was temperature controlled and kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. In this facility, the experimental animals received non-sterilized feed (LabDiet 5053) and non-acidified, non-sterilized water.</p>
