<p class="p">Glucose tolerance tests were performed only in females in blocks of mice in estrus (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 16/block). Mice were weighed at 1000 h, and fasted from 1000 to 1600 h. A baseline (0 min) blood sample was collected via tail snip at 1600â€“1630 h, and blood glucose was determined using a glucose monitor (Accu-Chek Aviva Plus). Immediately after the baseline measurement was taken, 250 mg/mL glucose was injected intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg body weight. Blood glucose concentrations were measured at 30, 60, and 120 min post injection, as described previously (
