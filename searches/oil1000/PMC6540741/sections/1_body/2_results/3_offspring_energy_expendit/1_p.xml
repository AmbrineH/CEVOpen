<p class="p">Developmental exposure to the UOG chemical mixture was associated with altered energy expenditure in the dark cycle in females. After 24 h of acclimation, energy expenditure was assessed for the final 24 h. Energy expenditure data were divided into 12-h light and dark cycles for analysis. In the dark cycle, total energy expenditure was 16 and 19% lower and resting energy expenditure was 20 and 18% lower in the 1.5 and 150 μg/kg/day treatment groups respectively (
