<p class="p">Developmental exposure to EDCs has also been associated with metabolic disease later in life (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), and these chemicals have been termed “metabolic disruptors” (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). Exposure to multiple EDCs, e.g., bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and nicotine, among others, has been associated with one or more altered metabolic endpoints, such as obesity, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue regulation, and lipid disorders [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>) and (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>)]. UOG chemicals also have the potential to be metabolic disruptors. We have shown that both a 23-UOG mixture and UOG-impacted surface water samples had adipogenic activity

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). Studies in zebrafish have shown that exposure to UOG wastewater resulted in decreased metabolic rates (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). Two studies reported an association between maternal residential proximity to UOG sites and low birth weight infants, while another found an association between maternal residential proximity to UOG sites and increased birth weights (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Both high and low birth weights are associated with later-life development of obesity (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that female mice prenatally exposed to a mixture of 23 UOG chemicals from gestation day 11 through birth had increased body weights at postnatal days 7, 13, and 21. Body weight and composition can be indicative of energy imbalance.
