<p class="p">Unconventional oil and gas (UOG) extraction combines directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing to liberate oil and gas that was previously inaccessible by traditional drilling methods, including sources of shale gas, coal bed methane, and tight gas. Across the industry, over 1,000 chemicals have been reportedly used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Varying mixtures of these chemicals are combined with millions of gallons of water to fracture underground rock. UOG extraction has been identified as a potential source of EDCs, developmental and reproductive toxicants. We have previously reported that out of 24 UOG chemicals tested, 23 exhibited antagonist activity for one or more of the estrogen, androgen, progesterone, thyroid, and glucocorticoid receptors; and a mixture of 23 of these UOG chemicals exhibited antagonistic activity for all five receptors (
