<p class="p">Taken together, there is limited but suggestive data linking UOG chemicals and altered metabolism. However, no studies have examined the direct of effects of developmental exposure to UOG chemicals and energy expenditure and activity in adulthood. We hypothesized that preconceptional, gestational and lactational exposure to a laboratory-created mixture of UOG chemicals would alter energy balance in adult mice through modulation of energy expenditure. To test this hypothesis, we exposed female C57BL/6 mice to a mixture of 23 UOG chemicals 5 weeks prior to mating, and from gestation day (GD) 1 to postnatal day (PND) 21, and evaluated body composition, energy expenditure, activity, and glucose tolerance in adult offspring.</p>
