 <p> Experimental timeline. Dams ( n = 14, 9, 11, 8, and 10) that were exposed to the 23 UOG chemical mixture (at concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, or 10 Î¼g/mL, respectively) for 5 weeks prior to mating. Chemical exposure was paused while females were mated in order to bypass the window of fertilization, and to avoid consumption of treatment chemicals by the males. Treatment was resumed at gestational day 1 (1 day after presence of copulatory plug) and continued through weaning of the F1 generation at PND 21. Body composition was measured at PND 7, PND 21, and at 7 months of age. Energy balance analyses including energy expenditure, activity, food intake, and glucose tolerance were measured at 7 months of age. </p>
