<p class="p">Comparison of data means, using Duncan's test indicated that use of PEF and microwave pretreatments in this research led to an increase in the efficiency of oil extraction process (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3535-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Also, it was specified that those samples pretreated by microwave had a higher oil extraction efficiency in comparison with other samples. This could be attributed to the increased fracture of cell walls which contain oil during treatment with microwave (Uquiche, Jeréz, &amp; Ort, 
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Also, Mohamed and Awatif (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>) reported that the higher efficiency of oil extraction through heating with microwave may be resulted from destruction of protein components. Our findings conformed to the results of Momeny et al. (2012), and Nde, Boldor, and Astete (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). On the other hand, Schroeder, Buckow, and Knoerzer (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) expressed that applying PEF leads to an improvement in extraction efficiency because of electrical decomposition of cells and their higher permeability. Our results were in agreement with the results of Guderjan, Topfl, Angersbach, and Knorr (
 <xref rid="fsn3535-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>).The morphological analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3535-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) confirmed that application of PEF and microwave pretreatments will lead to disintegration of cells and consequently better extraction of oil from them.
