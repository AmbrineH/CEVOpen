<p class="p">Our results revealed that the influence of PEF and microwave pretreatments on the amount of chemical components of oil samples were quite significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;.01). As it is clear in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3535-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>, in all samples, the amount of thymoquinone was higher than other components and this is the dominant phenolic component in the black cumin oil. Thymoquinone has probably some antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and anti‐cancer properties and can inhibit and control the oxidative stresses (Khan &amp; Sharma,

 <xref rid="fsn3535-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>, it can be stated that when PEF was used as a pretreatment, much more components were extracted into the oil. After thymoquinone, cymene was the main component and it was completely conformed to the results of El Dakhakhny, Barakat, Abd El Halim, and Aly (

Some of these components were not observed in the control samples without any treatments; probably these components remain in the seed but when the microwave or PEF pretreatments were used, these components found their way into the oil.
