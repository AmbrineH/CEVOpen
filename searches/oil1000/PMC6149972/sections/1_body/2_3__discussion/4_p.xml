<p class="p">It is noteworthy that the antibacterial properties may also be contributed by other minor compounds present in the essential oils, as well as due to the possible interactions between the minor compounds or with the major active compounds. Mode of actions of the antibacterial activity may differ considerably depending on their interactive functions. Therefore, synergistic and/or additive effects might be taken into account and it is likely that the inhibition effect involve several sites of action at the cellular level due to a single and/or several different mechanism(s) of action of one or several compounds. Moreover, association of essential oil with antibiotics may lead to exertion of different mechanism of action thus provide new choices in overcoming the unsolved crisis of bacterial resistance [

Studies done by Sikkema et al. revealed that loss of membrane integrity was detected in the presence of cyclic terpenes such as α-pinene and β-pinene. Furthermore, aromatic compounds such as cinnamaldehyde was shown to inhibit the growth and impaired the physiology of the bacterial cells through its action on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane [
