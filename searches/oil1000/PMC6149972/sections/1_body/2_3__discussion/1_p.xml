<p class="p">The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> were mainly made up of sesquiterpenoids (44.6% and 60.9%, respectively). Both oils were also rich in monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids. Other major compounds present in 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> oil were α-humulene, eugenol, bicyclogermacrene and methyl eugenol, while α-humulene, germacrene D and eugenol were dominant in 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> oil. Previous study by Hossain et al. also stated that terpenoids were the major components of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> oil, while studies reported by Grison-Pige et al. showed that the major compounds present in the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic> sp. were sesquiterpenoids [
