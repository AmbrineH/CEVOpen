<p class="p">Amoxicillin, a semisynthetic drug belonging to the class penicillin, is a Î²-lactam antibiotic. It has a broad bactericidal spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Its cytotoxicity involves the inhibition of biosynthesis and repair of the bacterial mucopeptide cell wall through prevention of peptidoglycan crosslinking by inhibiting the peptidoglycan transpeptidase which consequently lead to the lysis of the bacterial cells (also known as cell wall inhibitor). However, a few studies revealed that the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria was greater than Gram-positive bacteria. This is due to its more rapid penetration ability against the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria [
