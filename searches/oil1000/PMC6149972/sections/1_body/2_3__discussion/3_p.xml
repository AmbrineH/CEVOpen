<p class="p">The essential oils standards tested in this study, caryophyllene, humulene and eugenol were the major compounds present in the tested oils. The essential oils of both plants and essential oil standards exhibited potential bactericidal effects against the tested oral pathogenic bacteria. Although the mode of action is still not fully understood, it is likely that the mechanism is related to the destruction of cellular integrity involving disruption of membrane structure and functions. One possible scenario is the irreversible damage to the membrane of bacterial cells, which induce losses and leakage of cellular contents, leading directly to the lysis of bacteria and therefore to its death. Moreover, the antibacterial activity may also be influenced by the susceptibility of the bacterial cells towards the chemical composition of the essential oils [

It is commonly found as a mixture in aromatic plants together with α-humulene and isocaryophyllene [

It is an isomer of β-caryophyllene. Germacrene D is also a sesquiterpene presents in plants. Scientifically, terpenes have been shown to cause damage to the morphological structure of bacterial cell membrane. Eugenol is a well-known natural product of phenylpropene. The antibacterial activity of all these compounds has been reported in previous studies although not against oral bacteria [

The possible mechanisms of antibacterial activity include disruption of the membrane and wall of bacteria cells resulting in discharge of the intracellular components. Thus, these bioactive compounds might attribute to the antibacterial activity of
