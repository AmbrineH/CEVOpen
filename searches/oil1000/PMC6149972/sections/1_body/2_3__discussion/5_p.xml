<p class="p">It was often reported that Gram-negative bacteria are less susceptible to the oils present in plants [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-22-02135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. As compared to the Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have more complex cell wall notably due to the presence of membrane located outside of the peptidoglycan layers, known as an outer membrane. It is constituted mainly with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that acts as a molecular filter or barrier to the hydrophilic compounds which may be one of the reason for the higher resistance of the Gram-negative bacteria. This difference also could be due to the variation in the rate and ability of penetration or disruptive capability of the essential oil compounds through the bacterial cell wall and cell membrane. However, in our study, all of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showed almost similar pattern of susceptibility against both essential oils and essential oil standards. Interestingly, the greater antibacterial effects of both essential oils against Gram-negative bacteria were clearly demonstrated from the MIC and MBC assays, and SEM analysis. Nevertheless, from the time-kill curve analysis, it clearly shows that the Gram-positive bacteria were indeed more susceptible as shorter time was needed for the combination to have an effect on the Gram-positive bacteria as compared to the Gram-negative bacteria. This is in accordance to a study on the effects of a variety of essential oil components towards the outer membrane permeability in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria [
