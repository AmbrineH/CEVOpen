<p class="p">The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> Benth and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> Jack were rich in sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes and phenylpropanoids. Both essential oils possessed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against oral Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which may be contributed by the presence of their active constituents, such as 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene, Î±-humulene, eugenol and germacrene D. These findings suggest the potential benefit of using both oils in the management of oral infectious diseases and as new alternative antibacterial agents to substitute synthetic antimicrobials.
