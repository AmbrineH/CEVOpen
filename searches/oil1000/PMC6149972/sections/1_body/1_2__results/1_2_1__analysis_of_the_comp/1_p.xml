<p class="p">Hydro-distillation of the whole parts of the plants yielded 0.33% of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> oil and 0.37% of 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> oil, based on a dry weight. The GC analysis of the oils resulted in identification of 30 and 40 compounds for 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic>, respectively. The quantitative and qualitative data of the volatile components of both oils are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02135-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, in order of elution on a DB-5 type column. Our study showed that 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> oil contained mainly β-caryophyllene (26.31%), bicyclogermacrene (7.7%), methyl eugenol (7.4%), α-humulene (5.06%), α-copaene (2.26%) and naphthalene (1.13), whereas the major constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> oil were β-caryophyllene (36.3%), eugenol (8.1%), germacrene D (7.7%), α-humulene (5.5%) and α-copaene (3.3%).
