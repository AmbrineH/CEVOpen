<p class="p">The synergism activity of the essential oils combined with amoxicillin as determined by the checkerboard microdilution technique is presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02135-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The combination of both oils at their MIC value (0.63 to 1.25 mg/mL) and also the combination of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> oils with amoxicillin tested at their MIC ranges (0.63 to 1.25 mg/mL) yielded additive effect as defined by the FIC index of 0.75. An additive effect is observed when there is two-fold decreasing in the MIC of both components and thus the effect of the combination is equal to the sum of the effect of individual component [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-22-02135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-22-02135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Time-kill experiment was performed to confirm and validate the activity of the combination of both essential oils with amoxicillin. All combinations of specified concentration showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect in a time- and dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02135-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The most effective combination was the 2× MIC as it consisted of the highest concentration of each agent in the combination. The bactericidal endpoints for all the oral bacteria tested were reached after 8 and 4 h of incubation at concentrations of 1× and 2× MIC of the combination, respectively.
