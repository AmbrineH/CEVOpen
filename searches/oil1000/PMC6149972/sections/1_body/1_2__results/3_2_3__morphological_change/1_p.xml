<p class="p">Any modification or alteration on the morphology of the bacterial cells after being treated with the oils and amoxicillin were observed under the field emission scan electron microscope (FESEM). The oral bacteria were treated with the oils at their respective MIC values and results are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02135-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02135-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. There were noteworthy alterations on the bacterial cells with regards to its shape, size and arrangement. The arrangement of the bacterial cells was still intact in clusters, while the morphology of the bacterial cells was observed slightly altered to become rough and irregular when compared to the controls (untreated bacteria). Generally, treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> oils gave similar effect on all tested oral Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Comparison with normal bacterial cells showed that the cells became pleomorphic, irregular in size and some ruptured. The bacterial cells also presented irregular arrangement as they merged and attached to each other. Few cells appeared collapsed and lysed, causing possibly leakage of the intracellular contents. These observations suggest that the mechanism of antibacterial activity of both oils may be related to the disturbance of membrane structure or cell wall of the bacteria upon exposure [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-22-02135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Meanwhile, tested Gram-negative bacteria showed drastic morphological alterations upon treatment with amoxicillin as compared to the tested oral Gram-positive bacteria. It is possible that the inhibition and interference with synthesis of cell wall may have caused the tested Gram-negative bacterial cells to lose control over its shape and size and further disruption in homeostasis leads to shrinkage and eventually death of those cells.
