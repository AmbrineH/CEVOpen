<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of the oils and their major compounds against the seven species of pathogenic oral bacteria are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02135-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The results indicated that there was no different in the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> oils against all Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil standards (
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene, α-humulene, eugenol and germacrene D) was greater against Gram-negative bacteria as compared to Gram-positive bacteria. On the other hand, all of the monospecies biofilms of the oral bacteria tested were found resistant against both oils and the essential oil standards at the tested range of 0.04–5.0 mg/mL. Our study also showed that the aerobic bacteria, namely 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. mitis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. salivarius</italic>, were moderately susceptible to all the oils and the essential oil standards. However, the anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, were slightly susceptible to the essential oil standards. Nevertheless, the antibacterial activity of both oils and the standards was still at the intermediate level as compared to the activity of amoxicillin (positive control), i.e., MIC ≤ 8 µg/mL is considered susceptible and MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL is resistant for Gram-positive bacteria, whereas MIC ≤ 0.5 µg/mL is considered susceptible and MIC ≥2 µg/mL is resistant for Gram-negative bacteria [
