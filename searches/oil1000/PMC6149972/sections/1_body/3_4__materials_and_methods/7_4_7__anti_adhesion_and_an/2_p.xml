<p class="p">The anti-biofilm assay determined the effect of the oils and the essential oil standards on the pre-formed biofilm which will suggest the oils and their active compounds ability to remove by possible killing bacteria in biofilm. A 72 h preformed monospecies biofilm for each

The oils and the essential oil standards were then added into the pre-formed biofilm and further incubated accordingly, either aerobically or anaerobically. Untreated pre-formed biofilm acted as negative control, whereas amoxicillin-treated biofilm (5.0 mg/mL in DMSO) acted as positive control. The density of untreated and treated biofilms was quantified by using 0.1% crystal violet staining procedure as described above [
