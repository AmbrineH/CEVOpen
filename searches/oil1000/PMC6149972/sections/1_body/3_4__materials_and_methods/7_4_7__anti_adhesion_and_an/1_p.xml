 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cfu/mL were dispensed in a 96-well microtiter plate containing the oils or the essential oil standards at 1:1 ratio. Untreated cells acted as negative control whereas amoxicillin-treated cells (5.0 mg/mL in DMSO) acted as positive control. After the incubation, wells were washed with distilled water to remove non-adhered bacteria. Quantification of the remaining adhered bacteria was done by adding 0.1% crystal violet dye into each well and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before being washed for three times with 200 µL of sterile distilled water. Then, bacteria in each well was fixed with 100 µL of 95% ethanol (95% ethanol in water) for 10 min. The crystal violet stained cells were extracted and their optical density (OD) were measured at 590 nm wavelength. All assays were carried out in triplicates in three independent experiments
