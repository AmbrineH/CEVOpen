The evaluation was carried out by using broth microdilution (two-fold) method in a 96-well microtiter plate that already being inoculated with the tested oral pathogens. Combination of essential oils and amoxicillin (1/8, ¼, ½, 1 and 2) was prepared accordingly. All assays were carried out in triplicates in three independent experiments. Synergism is defined as the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) and the indices were calculated using the formula below:
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <label class="label">(i)</label>
   <p class="p">The FIC of oil (FIC
    <sub class="sub">A</sub>) = MIC combination/MIC alone.
