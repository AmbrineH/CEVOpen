<p class="p">Time-kill assay was carried out to evaluate the bactericidal activity of the respective combination oils-antibiotics against the tested oral pathogens. The duration of the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect can be determined by plotting the number of viable bacterial colonies remaining after exposure with the combination. The cultures of all pathogenic oral bacteria tested with a cell density of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cfu/mL were exposed to the combination (essential oil + Amoxicillin) at their ½, 1× and also 2× MIC concentration at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 h). Time-kill curve was plotted as log10 cfu/mL vs time functions to illustrate the relationship between the two variables. All assays were carried out in triplicates in three independent experiments.
