<p class="p">Analysis of the oils was first carried out using the Shimadzu GC2000 with column DB-5 (1 µm thickness, 30.0 m length, 0.25 mm diameter) with the temperature of injector and detector maintained at 250 °C initially. Oils were dissolved in ethyl acetate and 0.1 µL was injected in individual mode. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Temperature of the oven was programmed at 75 °C at the initial step for 10 min, and then gradual increased to 230 °C at 3 °C/min for 5 min. A homologous series of n-alkane standards (C
 <sub class="sub">9</sub> to C
 <sub class="sub">22</sub>) were also analyzed under similar condition as used for the oils. Kovat indices of the individual components of the oils were later calculated relative to the n-alkanes.
