<p class="p">Additionally, the oils were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Agilent 7890A and Agilent 5975C inert MSD (70 eV direct inlet) equipped with triple-axis detector and SE-30 (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm) column. Nitrogen gas was used as the carrier gas at a linear velocity of 50 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/min. The oven temperature was programmed at 60 °C for 10 min and increased gradually to 230 °C at 3 °C/min. The MSD Chemstation was used to detect all the peaks in the raw GC chromatogram and identification of all peaks was made using NIST/EPA/NIH version 2.0 database (Agilent technologies). Components were also identified by comparing their relative retention indices with those in the literature [
