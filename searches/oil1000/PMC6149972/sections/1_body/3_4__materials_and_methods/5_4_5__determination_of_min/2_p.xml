<p class="p">The MIC value was confirmed visually by determining the lowest concentration of the test sample that inhibited visible growth of bacteria and also by reading of absorbance at 590 nm wavelength using Varioscan plate reader (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). To determine the MBC value, 10 µL of bacterial inoculum from each well of the determined MIC starting from the MIC value to the highest concentration in the series, were transferred and cultured on agar plates (BHI or BHI-T) and incubated for another 24–48 h. The MBC value is the lowest concentration of the test sample that able to kill the bacteria and thus showed no bacterial growth on the agar. All assays were carried out in triplicates in three independent experiments.</p>
