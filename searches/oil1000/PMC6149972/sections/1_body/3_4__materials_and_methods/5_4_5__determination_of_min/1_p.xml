<p class="p">The broth microdilution technique was used to determine the MIC values of each oil and oil standards (&gt;98% purity) namely β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, eugenol and germacrene D (Chromadex), in a 96-wells microtiter plates (CLSI) [

The bacterial suspension in broth and the test samples in broth were used as negative controls to ensure medium sterility while amoxicillin (0.1 mg/mL prepared in sterile filtered water) acted as positive control.
