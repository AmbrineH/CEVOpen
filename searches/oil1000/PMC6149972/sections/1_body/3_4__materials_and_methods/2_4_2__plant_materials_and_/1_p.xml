<p class="p">Fresh whole plants of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> were collected from Alor Star, Kedah, Malaysia in February 2015 and deposited as voucher specimens in the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Herbarium (voucher Nos.: 4021 and 40224, respectively). Stems and leaves of the plants were left to dry under shades for approximately one week, grounded and then weighed. The oils were extracted using hydro-distillation method with Clevengerâ€™s apparatus (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). One hundred grams of powdered sample were dissolved in distilled water for 8 h and eventually the oily layers were separated and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Oil yields were calculated based on the dry weight of plant and averaged for three experiments.
