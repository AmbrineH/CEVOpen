 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cfu/mL before being exposed to the oils and the essential oil standards at their MIC concentration for 4 h. Then, the bacteria were harvested, washed with PBS and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde (2% glutaraldehyde in PBS). The bacteria also underwent dehydration with a series of increasing concentration of ethanol (50%, 75%, 85%, 95% and 100%), treatment, critical-point drying and gold coating before observation under the FESEM to observe changes on the bacterial morphological feature upon exposure to the essential oil.
