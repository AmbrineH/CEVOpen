<p class="p">Oral health problems, particularly periodontal diseases, dental caries and endodontic infections, are the most significant destructive processes in the oral cavity and are a costly burden to the public globally. Periodontal diseases are pathologic conditions of bacterial infection of the structures around the teeth (including the gums, the cementum that covers the root, the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone) that can lead to tooth loss affecting more than half of all adults. Dental caries (tooth decay or cavities) are the most common and widespread chronic oral diseases that affect children and adults. They are irreversible infectious diseases of the teeth leading to cavities in the teeth structure, thus compromising the structure and function of the teeth [

Meanwhile, endodontic infections are polymicrobial infections that affect the tooth canal system which allow the teeth to grow, mature and respond to stress. Oral diseases are initiated by bacterial infection in the oral cavity and trigger inflammatory responses that will continue until the source of infection is removed through dental treatment of choice [

The combined ill effects of these major oral diseases weaken bodily defense and may also serve as portal of entry to other more chronic and opportunistic infections. Indeed, oral diseases create a silent epidemic, placing a heavy burden on worldwide populations [
