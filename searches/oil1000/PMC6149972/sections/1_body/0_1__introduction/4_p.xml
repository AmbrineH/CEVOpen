<p class="p">This study focused on assessing the antibacterial properties as well as profiling the bioactive compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> essential oils, with a high expectation to create and develop a highly effective intervention against invasive oral infections caused by different types of oral pathogens. Besides, answering these questions will also allow us to gain better insight of the significant contribution of 
 <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> towards combating selected oral pathogens. This latter may pave the way to pharmaceutical applications in the near future and consequently result in the development of a novel preventive strategy to prevent the infections caused by these pathogens.
