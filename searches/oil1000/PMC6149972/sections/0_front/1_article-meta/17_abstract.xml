 <p class="p">In this study, the essential oils of 
  <italic class="italic">Orthosiphon stamineus</italic> Benth and 
  <italic class="italic">Ficus deltoidea</italic> Jack were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against invasive oral pathogens, namely 
  <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mitis</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>. Chemical composition of the oils was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity of the oils and their major constituents were investigated using the broth microdilution method (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)). Susceptibility test, anti-adhesion, anti-biofilm, checkerboard and time-kill assays were also carried out. Physiological changes of the bacterial cells after exposure to the oils were observed under the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). 
  <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> oils mainly consisted of sesquiterpenoids (44.6% and 60.9%, respectively), and β-caryophyllene was the most abundant compound in both oils (26.3% and 36.3%, respectively). Other compounds present in 
  <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> were α-humulene (5.1%) and eugenol (8.1%), while α-humulene (5.5%) and germacrene D (7.7%) were dominant in 
  <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic>. The oils of both plants showed moderate to strong inhibition against all tested bacteria with MIC and MBC values ranging 0.63–2.5 mg/mL. However, none showed any inhibition on monospecies biofilms. The time-kill assay showed that combination of both oils with amoxicillin at concentrations of 1× and 2× MIC values demonstrated additive antibacterial effect. The FESEM study showed that both oils produced significant alterations on the cells of Gram-negative bacteria as they became pleomorphic and lysed. In conclusion, the study indicated that the oils of 
  <italic class="italic">O. stamineus</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">F. deltoidea</italic> possessed moderate to strong antibacterial properties against the seven strains pathogenic oral bacteria and may have caused disturbances of membrane structure or cell wall of the bacteria.
