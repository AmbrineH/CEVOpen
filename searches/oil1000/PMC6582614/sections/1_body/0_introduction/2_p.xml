Typically, these substitutions lead to an increase in the complex' overall basicity, resulting in higher reduction potentials. Given the inverse relationship between overall basicity and redox potential, such terminal ligand substitutions generally do not lead to catalysts that operate with high rates at a mild overpotential.
