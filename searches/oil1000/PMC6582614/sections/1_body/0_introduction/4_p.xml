<p class="p">With the aim to study the effect of changing the dithiolato bridge for a pyridine bridge on the catalytic overpotential, we report novel [FeFe]‐H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>ase mimics 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>, in which the iron atoms are connected by a pyridine bridge in a κ

 <italic class="italic">N</italic> fashion (Figure 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The pyridine ring of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> is substituted with a thioisopropyl group and that of 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> with a dimethylamine group, which may serve as a “proton relay” due to its basic nature. The catalysts are capable of reducing protons from acids that are weaker than acetic acid at their first reduction potential, resulting in a catalytic overpotential that is up to 240 mV lower than that of [Fe
