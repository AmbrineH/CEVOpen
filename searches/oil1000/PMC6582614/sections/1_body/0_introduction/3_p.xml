<p class="p">The beneficial effect on the catalytic overpotential when transitioning from a 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>‐pdt to a 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>‐adt bridge suggests that modification of the bridging ligand could be key to lowering the overpotential. The class of hydrogenase mimics based on a bridging pyridine–monothiolato ligand is relatively unexplored. The synthesis of such complexes has been described from the corresponding thioester,
