 <bold class="bold">L1</bold> (0.42 g, 1.85 mmol) was dissolved in 25 mL of toluene. The solution was transferred to the iron precursor and the mixture was heated to 100 °C in a preheated oil bath. The reaction progress was monitored by IR spectroscopy. After a reaction time of 15 minutes the dark red mixture was cooled to room temperature. The volatiles, including the side‐product Fe(CO)
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, were carefully removed under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica, eluent: gradient from hexane to hexane/CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 80:20). The thus obtained pure compound was dissolved in 25 mL of pentane after which the volatiles were removed under vacuum to afford complex
