<p class="p">All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of argon using standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents used for synthesis and analysis were degassed and dried using suitable drying agents. Purification that involves extraction or column chromatography was performed in air with solvents used as received. The iron compounds were protected from light as much as possible. Commercial chemicals were used without further purification. The supporting electrolyte NBu

All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 (400 MHz) or a Bruker DRX 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer and referenced internally to the residual solvent signal of CD
