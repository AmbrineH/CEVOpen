 <bold class="bold">L2</bold> (40 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of toluene and transferred to the iron precursor and the resulting mixture was heated to 100 °C in a preheated oil bath. The reaction progress was monitored by IR spectroscopy. After 15 minutes the dark red mixture was cooled down to room temperature. The volatiles, including the side product Fe(CO)
