 <bold class="bold">2</bold>) in proton reduction catalysis. The effect of the pyridine bridge on the catalytic properties of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> is evaluated by comparing the parameters with the known complex [Fe

 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>‐bdt)(CO)
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>]. The novel complexes are shown to reduce protons at their first reduction potential, whereas [Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>‐bdt)(CO)
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>] requires a more negative potential to drive catalysis. As a consequence, proton reduction catalysis is demonstrated with the lowest overpotential (120 mV) ever reported for [FeFe]‐H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>ase mimics. The impact of the pyridine bridge of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> on their overpotential is remarkable, and the effect of modifying the bridging fragment of di‐iron hydrogenase mimics is interesting to study further, as the development of a system that operates with a mild overpotential is the key challenge to efficient storage of electrical energy in chemical bonds.
