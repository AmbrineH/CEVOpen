 <bold class="bold">1</bold>
 <sup class="sup">–</sup> shows the first Fe–C shell at a distance of 1.83(1) Å with an overall coordination number of 2.5 and C/N bond lengths of 2.10(1) Å with a coordination number of 2 (for full description of EXAFS analysis, see Supporting Information, Section 5). Additionally, the Fe–Fe contribution is fitted with an elongated bond length of 2.69(2) Å compared to the original value of 2.60(1) Å. This analysis confirms the breakage of the Fe–N bond and one Fe–S bond and the formation of a bridged CO ligand, as suggested by the IR analysis and DFT computations.
