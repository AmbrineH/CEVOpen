<p class="p">The irreversible redox behavior of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> suggests that the complex displays follow‐up chemistry upon reduction. More detailed insight into the structure of the mono‐reduced species comes from DFT calculations (Supporting information, Section 6). Computations were performed on the monoanionic 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>
 <sup class="sup">–</sup> and anionic 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>
 <sup class="sup">2–</sup> species, both with all terminal carbonyl ligands and with one bridging carbonyl ligand. A comparison of the computed IR spectra with the experimental spectra reveals that mono‐anion B, which contains a bridging carbonyl ligand, shows the best fit (Figure 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b). This is consistent with the spectroelectrochemical measurements that indicate the presence of a bridging carbonyl ligand upon reduction of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>. The significant difference in the calculated and experimental wavenumber for the bridging carbonyl ligand is likely due to its position being greatly affected by the solvent.
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">30</xref> The Fe–N bond and one of the Fe–S bonds are broken in the mono‐reduced species, allowing for the structural rearrangement into a bridging carbonyl species (Figure 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). Such a rearrangement accounts for the irreversibility of the reduction wave observed in the voltammogram and is reminiscent of chemistry observed with benzene dithiolate analogs.
