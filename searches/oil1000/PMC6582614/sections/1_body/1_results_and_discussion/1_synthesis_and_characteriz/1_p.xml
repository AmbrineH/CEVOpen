<p class="p">Ligand 
 <bold class="bold">L1</bold> is obtained in one step according to a literature procedure, by reacting 2,3‐dichloropyridine with an excess of sodium isopropylthiolate at 85 °C in an S
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>Ar reaction.

 <bold class="bold">L2</bold> is prepared in two steps starting from 3‐amino‐2‐chloropyridine. First, the free aminopyridine is methylated using formaldehyde and formic acid in an Eschweiler–Clarke reaction. Subsequently, the chloride substituent is displaced by isopropylthiolate in an S
 <sub class="sub">N</sub>2 reaction. Complex 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> is obtained in 27 % yield by heating a mixture of 
 <bold class="bold">L1</bold> and iron precursor Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(CO)
 <sub class="sub">9</sub> (2 equiv.) in toluene at 100 °C for 15 min under an inert atmosphere (Scheme 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Complex 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> (17 % yield) is prepared using an identical procedure in the presence of ligand 
 <bold class="bold">L2</bold> (for the full synthetic protocol of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>, see Supporting information, Section 2).
