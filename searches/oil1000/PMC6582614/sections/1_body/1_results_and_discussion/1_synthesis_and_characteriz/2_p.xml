<p class="p">Compounds 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> are fully characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, high‐resolution mass spectrometry and single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction (for full characterization, see Supporting information, Section 2). The IR spectra of both complexes display the typical fingerprint of di‐iron hexacarbonyl complexes (Table 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Supporting information, Figure S5–S7).

 <xref rid="ejic201900405-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">21</xref> The bands of 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> appear at lower stretching frequencies compared to those of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, in line with more electron‐rich iron centers of 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> due to the electron‐donating amino substituent. The 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectrum of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> shows two signals with a doublet splitting pattern for the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups of the bridging isopropyl substituent (Supporting information, Figure S1). The doublets in the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectrum indicate that the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups are diastereotopic. X‐ray analysis of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> confirms that it exists as two enantiomers, making the methyl groups diastereotopic (Supporting information, Figure S8). The 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR spectrum of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> shows a signal at 193.5 ppm, which is typical for a species with a Fe–C bond (Supporting information, Figure S2).
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">22</xref> Complex 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> shows similar features in its 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR spectrum (Supporting information, Figure S3–S4).
