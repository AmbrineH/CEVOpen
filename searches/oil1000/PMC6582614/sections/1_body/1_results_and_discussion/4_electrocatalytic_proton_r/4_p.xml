<p class="p">To investigate whether the dimethylamine substituent of 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> can be applied as a “proton relay” and thereby also affect the catalytic overpotential, catalytic studies were undertaken using the slightly stronger acid, chloroacetic acid (ClCH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>COOH; p
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> = 15.3). Cyclic voltammetry of 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> in the presence of ClCH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>COOH reveals that the acid is not strong enough to protonate the complex prior to reduction, as evident from the lack of an anodic shift in the reduction wave (Figure 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>b). A significant anodic shift of the reduction wave of the catalyst would be expected if the complex was protonated prior to reduction. Complex 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> shows similar behavior as 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>, whereas [Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>‐bdt)(CO)
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>] displays yet again a higher catalytic rate but also a higher overpotential than both 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> as clear from the higher current of the catalytic wave as well as its more negative potential (Figure 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>a and Figure 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>c).
