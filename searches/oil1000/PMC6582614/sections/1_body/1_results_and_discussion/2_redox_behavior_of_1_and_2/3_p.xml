<p class="p">The semi‐integral convolution plot of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> in the presence of an equimolar amount of ferrocene suggests a one‐electron reduction process, assuming that the diffusion constant of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and ferrocene are similar (Supporting information, Figure S15). Controlled potential coulometry (–1.9 V) of a solution of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> confirms the passage of one electron per molecule (Supporting information, Figure S16). Moreover, the IR spectrum of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> in the presence of 1.6 equiv. of the reducing agent decamethylcobaltocene (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1/2</sub> = –1.91 V in MeCN)
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">29</xref> shows complete reduction to 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>
 <sup class="sup">–</sup> (Supporting information, Figure S17). On the contrary, the IR spectrum of [Fe
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>‐bdt)(CO)
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>], which is known to undergo disproportionation and therefore has a two‐electron reduction at 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1/2</sub> = –1.32 V, shows a mixture of neutral and [FeFe]
 <sup class="sup">2–</sup> species in the presence of the same amount of reductant (Supporting information, Figure S18). Based on these experiments we prudently conclude that 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> undergoes a one‐electron reduction, and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> is expected to display the same electrochemical behavior, albeit at slightly different potential.
