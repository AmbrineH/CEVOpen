<p class="p">Cyclic voltammetry of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> in acetonitrile reveals an irreversible reduction wave with a cathodic peak potential of around –1.8 V (vs. Fc
 <sup class="sup">0/+</sup>; all potentials are reported against this redox couple), followed by at least one anodically shifted re‐oxidation wave at around –0.6 V (Figure 
 <xref rid="ejic201900405-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Complex 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> displays similar redox behavior as 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, but with a 50 mV cathodic shift in both the reduction and oxidation event. This shift is caused by the more electron‐donating nature of the dimethylamine substituent of 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> as compared to the isopropylthiol substituent of 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, and this is in line with the observations in the IR measurements (vide supra). Both 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> are more difficult to reduce than known [FeFe]‐H

 <xref rid="ejic201900405-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and Supporting information, Figures S13–S14). For both 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">2</bold> the peak current of the reduction wave varies linearly with the square root of the scan rate, indicative of a solution‐based redox event (Supporting information, Figures S9–S12).
