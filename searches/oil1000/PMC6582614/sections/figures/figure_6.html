 <p> (a) DFT calculated (BP86, def2‐TZVP) structure (top) and chemical structure (bottom) of species 1 – (mono‐anion B). (b) DFT calculated IR spectrum of 1 – (blue columns) overlaid with the experimental spectrum of 1 – . The calculated spectrum is scaled by ν CO (scaled) = 1.023 × ν CO (calc.) – 24.6. 30 </p>
