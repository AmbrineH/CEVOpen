 <p> Electrocatalytic reduction using AcOH as proton source. (a) Cyclic voltammetry (0.1 V s –1) of 1.0 mM 1 (red trace) and [Fe 2( µ‐bdt)(CO) 6] (black trace) in CH 3CN containing NBu 4PF 6 and 0–60 equiv. AcOH. The inset shows the cyclic voltammogram of 1 in the presence of 0 and 1 equiv. AcOH. (b) Cyclic voltammetry (0.1 V s –1) of 1.0 mM 2 (red trace) and [Fe 2( µ‐bdt)(CO) 6] (black trace) in CH 3CN containing NBu 4PF 6 and 0–60 equiv. AcOH. The inset shows the cyclic voltammogram of 2 in the presence of 0 and 1 equiv. AcOH. </p>
