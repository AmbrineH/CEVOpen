<p class="p">In this review an attempt has been taken to present the medicinally important flowers in Sri Lanka and their therapeutic uses. Generally, flowers have similar pharmacological properties as their other parts. But several flowers were reported to have special medicinal uses. Flowers such as
 <italic class="italic"> Stereospermum suaveolens</italic> (Roxb.)/
 <italic class="italic">Bignonia suaveolens</italic> Roxb (Palol) flowers are used to treat malaria and bronchitis. Also the most popular Clove oil is obtained from the flower buds of
 <italic class="italic"> Syzygium aromaticum </italic>(Karabu-neti) which is used to treat toothaches since it has antibiotic and antiseptic properties. Some flowers such as
 <italic class="italic"> Woodfordia floribunda </italic>(Militta) are added as fermenting agents in the preparation of Arishtas in Ayurveda. Also powder of this flower is administered with honey in the treatment of leucorrhoea and water decoction of the fresh flowers of this plant either alone or in combination with ginger (
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic>) is used for the treatment of dysentery. Flowers of
 <italic class="italic"> Wrightia antidysenterica</italic> Linn (Sudu idda/Wal-idda) are important for the treatment of Russell's viper snake bite and to treat Gonorrhea. The leaf, flower, and seeds of
 <italic class="italic"> Sphaeranthus hirtus/indicus</italic> (Mudamahana) plant are ground into a paste and applied topically to treat skin diseases. Juice of
 <italic class="italic"> Saraca indica</italic> (Asoka) flowers are used as a cardiac tonic. Also some flowers possess properties that are different from the pharmacological properties of the other parts of the plant. For example
 <italic class="italic"> Butea monosperma</italic> flowers have diuretic, astringent, and tonic properties while the root of this plant has analgesic properties. The flowers of
 <italic class="italic"> Punica granatum</italic> had been used in traditional medicine to treat vaginal discharge and diarrhoea while the juice of fruit is used to treat gallbladder diseases.
