<p id="Par31" class="p">The lamotrigine matrix-type DIA transdermal patches comprising of different permeation enhancers were formulated. Release exhibited suitable attributes fitting best to Makoidâ€“Banakar-order kinetics. The drug was also found compatible with the excipients. Patch adhered to the surfaces in a compliant manner without causing apparent damages. All formulations showed good physical stability. Since formulation A3 containing oleic acid revealed a good in vitro release and permeation of drug, patch A3 was known to be best suited formulation amongst all for delivery of drug (lamotrigine) across the skin safely without causing even minor harm to the skin and thus can be possibly used as an alternative delivery route for administration of lamotrigine.</p>
