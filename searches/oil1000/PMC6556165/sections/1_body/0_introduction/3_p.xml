This study also helps in assessing the impact of various permeation enhancers on in vitro release and skin permeation of drug from matrix patches. The compatibility of the drug with excipients was also studied through FTIR technique. The optimized patch was further evaluated for skin sensitivity reaction to ensure that the formulated patch is suitable for skin application.
