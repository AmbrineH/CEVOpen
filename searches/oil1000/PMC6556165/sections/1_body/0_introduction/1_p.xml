<p id="Par2" class="p">Transdermal drug delivery systems are suitable alternatives to conventional delivery routes and possess advantages of predicted and controlled rate of transport, avoiding first-pass effect and improved patient compliance (Prausnitz and Langer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, the barrier properties of human skin restrict the delivery of drug molecules across it. Chemical permeation enhancers by interacting with skin constituents improve the flux of drug molecules (Williams and Barry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>). Thus, the use of chemical enhancers in transdermal preparations for enhancing the permeability of small lipophilic molecules has a long history (Karande et al.
