<p id="Par13" class="p">The interaction between drug and excipients of lamotrigine matrix patches was studied through FTIR analysis (Thermo-Nicollet AVATAR 5700, Madison, USA). For this purpose, the patch components were finely powdered and mixed with oven dried potassium bromide powder to form pellets. The sample was then scanned at wide spectral range of 7800–375 cm
