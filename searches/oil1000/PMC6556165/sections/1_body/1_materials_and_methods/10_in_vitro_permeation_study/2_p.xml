<p id="Par17" class="p">The receptor compartment was filled with 5 mL phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and the temperature of the assembly was maintained at 32 ± 0.2 °C through water circulating jacket. The receptor compartment was magnetic stirred at 450 rpm. The patches were fixed securely on the skin so that hairless epidermis (stratum corneum) was located between the donor and receptor compartments. The surface area of both skin and patch was 1.78 cm
