<p id="Par14" class="p">The content of lamotrigine from the formulated patches was estimated through a method reported by (Prajapati et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2011</xref>). The strip of patches (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6) having surface area of (1 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) was cut and dissolved in phosphate buffer saline pH 7.4 through sonication for 15 min. The solution was then stirred magnetically for 24 h. The resultant solution was filtered (Whatman filter paper) and analyzed spectrophotometrically at 267 nm (UV-1800, Shimadzu Corporation Kyoto, Japan). The absorbance of sample was compared with that of standard at concentration of 40 µg/mL.
