 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2008</xref>). The Albino Wistar rats were divided into three groups (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5). The animals were kept in laboratory for 7 days before test to acclimatize with the environment. Dorsal abdominal skin of rat was shaved using electric clipper 1 day before experiment. No treatment was given to the control group, i.e., group 1. The lamotrigine patch having maximum flux was selected for skin sensitivity study that was applied on group 2 animals. The standard irritant 0.8% v/v formalin solution was applied on the skin of animals of group 3 to compare the effects. The signs of irritation and erythema were visually observed for 6 days and were scored according to the method mentioned by Draize et al. (Draize et al.
