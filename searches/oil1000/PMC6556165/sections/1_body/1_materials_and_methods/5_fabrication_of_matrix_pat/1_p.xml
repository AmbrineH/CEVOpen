<p id="Par9" class="p">The matrix-type patches A1–A5 were prepared using various permeation enhancers as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Fixed amount of drug (30 mg), adhesive (DuroTak
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 387-2510 10 mg), Eudragit
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> RS100 matrix polymer mixture (4% m/m), plasticizer (DBP 1 mL), and enhancer (2 mL to numerated patch A2–A5) were mixed in ethanol (10 mL), and for control patch (A1) permeation enhancer was not added in the solution mixture. The solution was magnetically stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was then spread on release liner (Scotchpak 9755) through micrometer film applicator (Sheen Instruments, UK) to obtain 120-µm-thick wet film. The patches were air dried at room temperature for 1 h and then were laminated with a backing membrane (CoTran 9720). The patches were cut to appropriate size, packed in aluminum foil and stored at room temperature.
