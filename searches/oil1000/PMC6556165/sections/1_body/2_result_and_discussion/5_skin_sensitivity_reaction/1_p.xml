<p id="Par30" class="p">The skin irritation causes slight pain and discomfort at the area of application and in 1.7–6.8% cases patches are discontinued due to skin reactions. The skin sensitivity reactions caused by patches are mostly localized and resolve after a few days of patch removal. The rotation of the application site can also minimize the chances of such reaction (Ale et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2009</xref>). The pressure-sensitive adhesive used in transdermal preparation may lead to skin irritation reaction and must be evaluated prior to application on the skin (Venkatraman and Gale 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">1998</xref>). Skin sensitivity reaction of formulation A3 was studied and compared with the standard irritant. The skin condition was visually inspected for irritation, allergy, redness and rashes, and scored according to Draize method (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). It was observed that animals of group 3 showed severe skin reaction on the day of application and moderate for the next 3 days followed by a mild and then normal skin condition. The test group (group 2) exhibited no skin reaction, which was comparable to the skin condition of control group 1 animals indicating the formulated patch does not cause any skin sensitivity reaction.
