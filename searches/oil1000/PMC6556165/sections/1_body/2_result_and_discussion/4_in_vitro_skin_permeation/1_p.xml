 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2014</xref>). Formulation A2 comprising of lemon oil as a penetration enhancer showed its maximum burst at 15 min that might be because some essential oils are compatible with the buffer medium that means they would not take longer to solubilize inside a solvent thus letting drug to be exposed to the medium. However, the polymer, Eudragit

Similar studies were conducted by Jiang et al., where different permeation enhancers were used and concluded that essential oils are safe, non-toxic and an effective way of delivering many drugs across skin by causing a reversible change in the stratum corneum.
