 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. Formulation A3 consisting of oleic acid as enhancer exhibited maximum permeability with ER of 3.55. Oleic acid mainly affects the lipids of stratum corneum; its uptake by stratum corneum decreases the transition temperature of lipid and enhances the permeation of drug (Francoeur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">1990</xref>). It also acts by decreasing the viscosity of lipids of superficial layer (Naik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">1995</xref>). Touitou et al. studied the effect of various penetration enhancers on morphology of epidermal Langerhans cell and concluded that oleic acid has prominent effect on skin morphology hence improves permeation across skin (Touitou et al.
