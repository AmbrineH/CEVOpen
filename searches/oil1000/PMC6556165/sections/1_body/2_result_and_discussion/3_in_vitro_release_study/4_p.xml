 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> exhibited Makoid–Banakar release profile. When the c value of Makoid–Banakar model approaches zero, the model becomes identical to Korsmeyer–Peppas model (Al-Achi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2013</xref>). The release exponent ‘n’ indicates the type of diffusion followed by the formulation. In the current study, n values of formulation A3 and A4 were found between 0.5 and 1 showing Non-Fickian transport (Costa and Lobo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2001</xref>). Estradiol matrix patches were best fitted to Higuchi and Korsmeyer–Peppas and Makoid–Banakar release models. The value of n for Formulation A3 and A4 was between 0.5 and 1 indicating an anomalous transport, while A2 and A5 exhibited Fickian diffusion. The shape parameter β indicated that A1 and A3 have sigmoid S-shaped curve with value more than 1 while A2, A4 and A5 values are less than 1 with initial higher slope and parabolic shape curve. Shape parameter of less than 1 was observed in the case of estradiol patch (Costa and Lobo
