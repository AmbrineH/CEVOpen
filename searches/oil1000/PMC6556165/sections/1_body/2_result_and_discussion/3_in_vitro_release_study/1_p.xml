Propylene glycol possibly by forming hydrophilic micropores in the adhesive layer increases the release of drug from matrix patches. This was also comparable to the findings of Guyot and Fawaz in which the release of propranolol was increased due to the presence of propylene glycol (Guyot and Fawaz

In control formulation (A1), the initial burst effect and final excessive release were not observed indicating that the system comprising of hydrophobic polymer and the adhesive exhibits controlled release mechanism. However, the releases can be controlled by the addition and elimination of different quantities of adhesive, hydrophobic matrix and chemical enhancer, and thereby modifying according to the formulation type. Similar studies were conducted by Aggarwal where the matrix formulation consisting of Eudragit
