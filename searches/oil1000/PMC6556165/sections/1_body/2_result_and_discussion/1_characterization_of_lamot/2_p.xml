<p id="Par21" class="p">The moisture content of the matrix patches must be low so that the patches remain stable and do not completely dry to form brittle patches (Gannu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2007</xref>). The small moisture content ranging from 0.10 ± 0.23 to 0.52 ± 0.022 indicates that a stable formulation was prepared. The moisture uptake by patches was also less, i.e., between 0.21 ± 0.026 and 0.72 ± 0.014%. This is important for preventing microbial contamination and also lowers bulkiness (Ubaidulla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2007</xref>).
