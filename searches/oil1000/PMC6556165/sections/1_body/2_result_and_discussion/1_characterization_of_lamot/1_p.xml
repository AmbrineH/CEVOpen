<p id="Par20" class="p">The lamotrigine patches were characterized, and results are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The mean weight of formulations A1–A5 ranged from 960 ± 9.54 mg to 970 ± 4.47 mg and the percent drug loading was found between 95.5 ± 0.4 and 98.2 ± 0.9%. The results specify that weight of different formulations was approximately similar with drug loading within specified limits of 90–110%. This similarity in weight and uniformity in drug content indicate that the method of patch preparation was efficient enough to produce patches with minimum variability in drug content and can be employed in preparing matrix patches of lamotrigine at commercial scale.
