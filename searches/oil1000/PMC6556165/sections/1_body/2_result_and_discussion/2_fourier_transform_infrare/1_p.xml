 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> represents the FTIR spectra of patches consisting of variable permeation enhancers. The characteristic C–Cl peak of lamotrigine was observed between 600 and 800 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the peak at 1006.49 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> indicated C–H bend, and –CH alkyl stretch was observed at 2936.57 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in Fig.

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in c and at 2941.66 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in d. All peaks in every formulation were found within similar ranges except in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c, and a peak at 2974.36 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was observed also representing CH stretch. No overlapping or merging of spectral peak was observed indicating that there is no interaction between polymer, enhancer and drug. The FTIR drug-excipient compatibility study of matrix-type transdermal patches is extensively reported in the literature (Mukherjee et al.
