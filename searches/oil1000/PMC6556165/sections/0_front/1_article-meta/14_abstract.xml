 <p id="Par1" class="p">The drug-in-adhesive (DIA)-type matrix patches of lamotrigine are developed using variable permeation enhancers (oleic acid, PG, lemon oil and aloe vera), and drug in vitro release and its permeation are evaluated. Lamotrigine has been long used as an anti-epileptic, mood stabilizer, to treat bipolar disorder in adults and off label as an antidepressant. lamotrigine matrix patches comprising of Eudragit
  <sup class="sup">®</sup>RS100 (rate-controlling polymer) and DuroTak
  <sup class="sup">®</sup> 387-2510 (adhesive) were prepared by pouring the solution on backing membrane (3M-9720). The thickness of 120 µm was adjusted through micrometer film applicator. USP Apparatus V was used for the evaluation of release profile, which was fitted into various mathematical models. Quality characteristics of patches were determined through weight variation, moisture content, moisture uptake and drug content evaluation. FTIR studies were performed for drug-excipient compatibility; Franz diffusion cell was employed for studying in vitro permeation parameters such as flux, lag time, and ER. Skin sensitivity study of optimized patch was also performed. The release from patches comprising of PG and oleic acid was maximum, i.e., 96.24 ± 1.15% and 91.12 ± 1.11%, respectively. Formulations (A1–A5) exhibited Makoid–Banakar release profile. Formulation A3 consisting of oleic acid was optimized due to enhanced permeation of drug across skin compared to other enhancers with enhancement ratio of 3.55. Skin sensitivity study revealed patch as safe and non-allergenic. The study demonstrates that oleic acid can be used as a suitable permeation enhancer for transdermal delivery of lamotrigine from matrix-type patches.
