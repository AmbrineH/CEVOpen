<p class="p">Peanut seed development can be classified into seven classes with four incremental stages in each class [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Based on the color of the mesocarp, the last three classes are described and named as “orange”, “brown” or “black”. Pooled samples from each maturity classes were analyzed to determine macronutrient percentages, and results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00106-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The data reported is a check for comparison against the Biochemistry Research Laboratory database of crop samples from 2011–2018. The reported results in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00106-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> are consistent with observed trends in peanut crop analysis conducted by the Biochemistry Research Laboratory at Lubbock Christian University (LCU) during the 2011–2018 CYs. The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (Release 27, Basic Report 16087) reports macronutrient composition as 49.2% fat, 25.8% protein and 4.7% sugars. The reported results are within expected ranges as compared to the standard values. Any slight variation could be attributed to a specific variety versus average trends across all market types of cultivated peanut for a specific crop year.
