<p class="p">It is critical for farmers to harvest peanut at the optimized maturity to maximize the crop value, and a suitable biomarker could help farmers to harvest at the right time. We compared the profiles of the sterols and isoprenoids from the three stages, and there are no statistically significant differences among the major sterols. However, we found that α-tocopherol in the peanut hearts changed dramatically crossing the maturation stages. The absolute amount of this important metabolite was increased correspondingly from 0.92 μg/mg in orange to 1.61 μg/mg in brown, and peaked at 2.08 μg/mg in black. Given the fact that vitamin E is a very important metabolite to plant biology and a valuable compound to human health, we think that the content of vitamin E could be used as a biomarker for peanut harvesting. We plan to develop a user-friendly and portable method to determine vitamin E content, which may have important practical value to peanut farmers.</p>
