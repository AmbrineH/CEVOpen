<p class="p">Many phytosterols are present in nature [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In plants, the three biosynthetic end products in the phytosterol pathway are β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol. In 2004, it was reported that these three sterols account for approximately 95% of total peanut sterols [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Our analysis confirmed that these sterols are major components of total peanut sterols in each component, 82.29% of hearts, 86.39% of kernels and 94.25% seed coats (

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] were not detected. This discrepancy of results can be explained in addition to sample variations by two possible explanations. Firstly, squalene is the substrate for phytosterol, whereas γ-tocopherol can be converted to α-tocopherol via a methylation reaction. Depending on the harvest time, these two compounds may be converted to their final products and therefore are undetectable. Secondly, in the references, these sterols and tocopherols were determined by an HPLC method. Because of the differences in UV absorption between the two classes of compounds, tocopherol can be easily overestimated. Also, there were no internal standards used in the literature to correct the extraction and HPLC injection errors, as well as a reference for quantitation. Some variation may also be due to varietal differences, as these samples were isolated from Runner-type peanuts as compared to Spanish, Valencia and Virginia market types.
