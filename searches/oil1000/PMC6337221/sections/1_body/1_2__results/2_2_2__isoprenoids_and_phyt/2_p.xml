<p class="p">We found that of the three seed component classes analyzed, the kernel and seed coat generally contained the same percentage of α-tocopherol (0.63% and 0.64%, respectively), decreasing slightly with maturity in brown versus black mesocarp classes, 0.69% to 0.63% kernel composition and 0.71% to 0.64% seed coat composition (

Also, the amount of α-tocopherol increased from 0.09% in the orange mesocarp class, to 0.19% in the brown mesocarp class, and 0.24% in the black mesocarp class. Vitamin E comprises eight structurally related molecules including four forms of tocopherols. Peanuts, like many other oilseeds, contain tocopherols [
