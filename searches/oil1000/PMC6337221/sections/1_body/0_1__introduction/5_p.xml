<p class="p">Seed maturity proceeds with the thickening of cell walls and addition of oil bodies [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. For mature peanuts of the highest classification (black mesocarp), the cytoplasm of the parenchyma cells is essentially full of oil bodies. The specific aim of this project seeks to clarify the role of phytosterols in the formation of oil bodies as the seed matures. To accomplish this aim, seeds were organized into different maturity classes and the phytosterols extracted and identified. It is hypothesized that establishment of a critical mass of phytosterols provides the membrane stability for proliferation of oil bodies during maturation.
