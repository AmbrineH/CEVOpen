<p class="p">Physiological maturity impacts seed quality through a variety of mechanisms including desiccation tolerance, preparation of storage reserves and establishment of dormancy [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Thus, the impact of seed maturity on germination efficiency is of primary importance to peanut producers. To best assess physiological maturation, a method of classification based on color and morphological differences of the mesocarp was described for determining the developmental stages of fresh peanut [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Maturity determination by this method requires removal of a portion of the exocarp to expose the pod mesocarp. The characteristic darkening of the pericarp is part of a progressive change in colors resulting in mesocarp colors from white (immature) to black (mature) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The outer layer of the pod can be removed, and seeds sorted by maturity class (white, yellow, orange, brown or black) in a nondestructive manner allowing for physiological and chemical studies pertaining to the stage of development [
