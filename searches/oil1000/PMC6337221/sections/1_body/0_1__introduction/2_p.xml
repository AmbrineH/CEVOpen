 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Oilseeds, such as peanuts, store most of their lipids in small, intracellular organelles commonly called oil bodies [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Triglycerides form the majority of these oil bodies, and the interior triglycerides are encapsulated by a phospholipid bilayer and embedded oleosin protein. The oil bodies provide a stable energy reserve that can be accessed upon germination [
