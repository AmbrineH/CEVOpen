<p class="p">Phytosterols are a special class of structural lipids that provide stability and fluidity in cell membranes including specialized encapsulation of lipids, such as oil bodies [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The primary function of phytosterols are as membrane reinforcers and precursors for brassinosteroids, an important phytohormone in plants. Unlike animal and fungi counterparts with cholesterol and ergosterol as the dominant sterol, the plant usually synthesizes an array of sterols with different alkyl group substitutions at the sterol side chain. In addition to the primary function, the correct sterol composition is necessary for many aspects of plant biology such as embryonic pattern formation, cell division, cell elongation, cell polarity, cellulose accumulation, and interactions with other signaling pathways [
