<p class="p">Freshly harvested pods, 2017 crop year (CY), from one specific genotype of runner market-type peanuts grown under conventional cultural practices were obtained from the University of Georgia research facility under the direction of Dr. W.D. Branch. Pods were removed from the plant material, and ‘pod blasted’ to reveal the mesocarp. Pod blasting is a process by which in-shell peanut pods are placed in a wire basket and a residential-style pressure washer is used to spray the shell exterior with high-pressure water, removing the outer portion of the peanut hull and exposing the colored mesocarp layer underneath. The blasted pods were separated by color into three different maturity classes, orange, brown and black. After separation, the remainder of the pod outer layer was removed, and the seeds segregated for additional chemical analyses. Upon receipt at the research laboratory at LCU, samples were examined and verified to be
