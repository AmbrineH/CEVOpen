<p class="p">For each maturity class, 10–50 g of redskin kernels were weighed and dried in a forced-air oven (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) at 130 °C for 45 min. After cooling to ambient temperature, the kernels were manually separated by removing the skin, breaking open the seed, and removing the heart to subdivide the samples into three subsections consisting of seed coats, hearts and kernels. The subsections were scaled at a specific mass for 5 replicates. Each replicate of the heart and kernel contained 50 mg while the seed coat replicates contained 20 mg. Each scaled replicate was placed in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube with locking lid.</p>
