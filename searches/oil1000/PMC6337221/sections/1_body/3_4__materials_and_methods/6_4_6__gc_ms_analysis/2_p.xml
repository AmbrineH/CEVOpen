<p class="p">The GC/MS data was processed with ChemStation software (Version E.02.02.1431, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution &amp; Identification System (AMDIS) (National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States Department of Commerce, Washington, DC, USA). The sterol peaks were deconvoluted using AMDIS after baseline correction and identified by their relative retention time to cholesterol and comparison to the mass spectra from commercial mass database (NIST08 mass spectral library,
