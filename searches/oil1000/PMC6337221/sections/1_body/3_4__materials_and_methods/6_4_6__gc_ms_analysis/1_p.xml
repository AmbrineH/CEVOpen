<p class="p">2 µL of derivatization mixture was injected into an Agilent GC/MS (Agilent 6890 BC coupled with 5973 mass-selective detector (MSD)) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The GC was equipped with an Agilent DB-5Ms+DG narrow-bore capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm with 10 m Duraguard). The injection mode was splitless, with helium carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.2 mL/min. The GC oven was initialed at 170 °C, held for 1 min, the temperature was ramped to 280 °C at 40 °C/min and held at 280 °C for 25 min. The MSD was in electron ionization (EI) mode, scan range was from 50–550 amu, temperature of the ion source was 230 °C, the quadrupole temperature was 150 °C, and the interface was 280 °C.</p>
