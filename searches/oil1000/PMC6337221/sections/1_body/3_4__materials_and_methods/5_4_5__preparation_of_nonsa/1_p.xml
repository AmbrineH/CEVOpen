<p class="p">We prepared 10% KOH/methanolic solution by dissolving 50 g KOH in 50 mL deionized water and bringing to volume of 500 mL with methanol. We prepared internal standard by mixing the epicoprostanol 5β-cholestan-3α-ol with heptane to a final concentration of 1mg/mL. After adding 25 µL of internal standard solution and 1 mL 10% methanolic KOH to each tube, the samples were saponified at 80 °C for 2 h using a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with constant shaking at 500 rpm. Once cooled to ambient temperature, the nonsaponifiable fraction (NSF) containing free sterols was extracted with 1 mL of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. The hexane was pooled in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and the hexane was removed by evaporation in a fume hood overnight. To the residual, 20 µL of acetone was added to dissolve the sterols. After solvation, the compounds were converted to their trimethylsilyl ester by adding 10 μL of BSTFA and 10 μL of pyridine as catalyst. The derivatization mixtures were kept at room temperature for 30 min before GC/MS analysis.
