<p class="p">To analyze the seed sample for total fat by organic solvent extraction, the exact mass of 10 g ± 0.1 g sample was recorded and the sample pre-dried in a forced-air oven at 130 °C for 45 min to remove moisture. After cooling to ambient temperature, the dried sample was quantitatively transferred to an explosion-proof blender jar (Eberbach Corporation, Belleville, MI, USA). 60 mL dichloromethane (DCM) was added and the mixture blended at high speed for 1 min. After allowing the blender jar to cool for 30 s before opening, we removed the blender lid and washed down the sides of the blender with DCM in a wash bottle. We replaced the lid and blended at high speed for an additional 1 min. We allowed the blender jar to cool for 30 s before opening and washing down the sides of the blender with DCM a second time to remove all residue. We carefully poured the blender contents into a Büchner funnel vacuum filter apparatus with a Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) glass fiber filter, rinsing the blender jar residue with DCM into the funnel until all residue was removed. We filtered the mixture, and transferred the filtrate from the vacuum flask to a tared stainless beaker, rinsing the vacuum flask with DCM into the stainless beaker to ensure all residue was transferred. We evaporated the solvent in the stainless flask over a steam bath until all solvent had been removed. We monitored evaporation and weighed the beaker/remaining oil as needed by removing the beaker from the steam bath and allowing it to come to ambient temperature. Evaporation was complete when the mass of the oil remaining in the stainless beaker stabilized (≤0.03 g change in mass over a 30-min span on the steam bath). We recorded the final weight of the beaker and oil, and calculated the percent oil using the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">% Oil = [(Weight of Beaker with Oil − Empty Beaker Weight)/Sample Weight] × 100
