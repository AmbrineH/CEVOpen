 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In this study, it is reported that the kernel contains a higher percentage of stigmasterol as compared to the heart and seed coat. Different manufacturing processes may remove the seed coat or heart, so it is beneficial to the health of the consumer that the kernel possess relatively high concentrations of stigmasterol.
