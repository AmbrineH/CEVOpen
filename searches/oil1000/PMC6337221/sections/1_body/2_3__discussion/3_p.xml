<p class="p">Tocopherol content can vary with environmental stress and growing location in addition to other factors [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In this study, hearts contained the lowest percentage of α-tocopherol as compared to the other seed components, but the amount increased during maturation. During germination, the stability of the peanut heart, or embryo, is critically important to the development of the seedling and stand establishment under adverse environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. α-tocopherol deactivates ROS generated during photosynthesis and is upregulated during stressful events [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Immature peanut seed is less resistant to stress, and as a result, is more likely to be adversely affected during germination. The results suggest that the synthesis and accumulation of α-tocopherol in developing peanut hearts may be vitally important to seedling vigor upon germination.
