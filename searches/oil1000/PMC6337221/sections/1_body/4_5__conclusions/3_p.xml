<p class="p">Stigmasterol, one of the three end products in the phytosterol pathway in 
 <italic class="italic">A. hypogaea</italic>, is a significant component by percentage of seeds. The seed coat, or skin, is known to be a major contributor of antioxidant capacity and other health benefits. The relatively high concentration of stigmasterol may contribute to the health benefits reported by the addition of peanut skins to various manufactured goods. Also, stigmasterol biosynthesis is important in plant physiology to deal with low and high temperature stresses, and plays a key role in innate immunity to combat biotic stresses. Since the main function of the seed coat is to protect the embryo, high stigmasterol content may be important for seed storage and germination.
