<p class="p">Physiological maturity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. hypogaea</italic> seeds is impactful to germination efficiency, and consequently, is of economic importance to the peanut industry. Immature seeds have reduced germination frequency, are more susceptible to disease, and require more financial inputs during manufacturing processes which are dependent on fat content or roasting performance. This study seeks to characterize phytosterol and isoprenoid content in seed components as a function of physiological maturation indicated by mesocarp color class.
