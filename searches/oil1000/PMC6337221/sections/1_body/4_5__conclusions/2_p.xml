<p class="p">Peanut hearts contained the highest percentage of phytosterols and isoprenoids by mass as compared to the other seed components. The stability of the peanut heart, or embryo, is critically important to the development and vigor of the seedling during germination and plant development. Tocopherols provide plants with antioxidant capacity and provide fluidity and flexibility to cell membranes. α-tocopherol concentration in the hearts changed dramatically across maturation classes, providing a possible causal agent for poor stress adaptability in immature seeds. Given the economic importance of seed efficiency and performance in all sectors of the peanut industry, α-tocopherol content in the seed embryo could be utilized as a biomarker to optimize harvest timing and profitability. In the subsequent study, we will investigate more details to evaluate using α-tocopherol as a biomarker for peanut harvesting, and will develop a sensitive and portable α-tocopherol detection method for peanut farmers.</p>
