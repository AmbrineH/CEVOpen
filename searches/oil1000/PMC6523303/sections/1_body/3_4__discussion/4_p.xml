<p class="p">We have shown in the results the corrected protein parameter because chitin is a nitrogen-compound, so Kjeldahl’s method may overestimate the insect meal’s protein content [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, even fulfilling the protein correction, the values of chitin ADC found in this study are still considered high [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. According to Longvah et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] the chitin may interfere with the dietary utilization of protein, where a reduction on protein digestibility due to an increase in the chitin content is expected [

 <italic class="italic">N. cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">G. portentosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. assimilis</italic> meals, in the present study, presented lower protein ADC, which can be connected to this feed’s protein quality, that is, their amino acid composition or even because of their higher chitin content. However, tenebrios, 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. morio</italic> meals showed dry matter ADC close to the reported values for fishmeal and soybean meal [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] for Nile tilapia. The protein ADC of 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> meal was also close to that of those feeds [
