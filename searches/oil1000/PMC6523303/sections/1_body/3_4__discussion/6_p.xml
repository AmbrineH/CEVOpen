<p class="p">According to Tanaka et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], chitin may inhibit the absorption of lipids in the gut, increasing their excretion and, thereby affecting their digestibility coefficient. The insect meal chitin content in this study ranged from 12.01% to 28.94%, however, chitin did not seem to influence lipid digestibility, probably due to its high digestibility. The 
 <italic class="italic">G. portentosa</italic> meal presented the highest chitin content (28.94%) and the highest lipid ADC (98.8%) among treatments. Additionally, 
 <italic class="italic">N. cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. assimilis</italic> showed 91.6% and 87.9%, respectively, and this reduction was not a reflex of chitin levels, as Shiau and Yu [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] demonstrated, but can it be attributed to the insectâ€™s fatty acid quality; therefore this should be investigated.
