<p class="p">Insects have been widely studied as fish feed in the last few years, but only a few studies have focused on the nutrient and energy digestibility. The variation in nutrient and energy digestibility is based on the insect species, life stage, and the fish species [

Authors have reported that the inclusion of insect meals in fish diets is possible without damaging growth performance [

 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, it seems to depend on the inclusion level, fish species, insect species and nutrient composition. In the present study, it was possible to observe that different insect meals presented distinguished chemical compositions and nutrients and energy ADCs, so their inclusion in practical aquafeeds formulations need to be suitable regarding those specific characteristics, to maintain the quality and supply the nutritional requirements.
