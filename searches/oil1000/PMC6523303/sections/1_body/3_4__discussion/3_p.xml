<p class="p">Low values of dry matter ADC are found for 
 <italic class="italic">N. cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">G. portentosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. assimilis</italic>, ranging from 42.6% to 61.7%. This decrease in dry matter ADC can be explained by the feed’s bromatological composition, in which higher chitin values were found. Shiau and Yu [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], using diets with chitin levels of 0%, 2%, 5% and 10%, found that the highest level of supplementation was accompanied by a lower level of dry matter ADC for Nile tilapia. We can observe that for 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. morio</italic> the dry matter ADC was higher than the other diets’, which corroborates Shiau and Yu’s [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] research because 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. morio</italic> had the lowest chitin percentage in their composition.
