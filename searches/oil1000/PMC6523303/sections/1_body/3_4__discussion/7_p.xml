<p class="p">Nandeesha et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] reported that insect oil from silkworm pupa (
 <italic class="italic">Bombyx mori</italic>) have high amounts of digestible fatty acids and were as effective as sardine oil in providing energy to induce fast growth in common carp (
 <italic class="italic">Cyprinus carpio</italic>) fed 3%, 6% and 9% silkworm meal or sardine oil. Those authors also reported that fat digestibility increased with an increasing inclusion level of non-defatted insect meal. Lipid digestibility among fish is known to be quite variable and dependent on many factors, such as the inclusion level and fat source [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. In general, the lipid digestibility found in this study, although it differs among treatments, was relatively high and may be equated with conventional lipid sources such as full fat vegetable meals [
