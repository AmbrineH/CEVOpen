<p class="p">Nile tilapia is the fourth most farmed fish species around the world, representing 8% of total global inland production [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and 36% of the total Brazilian fish farming [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Nile tilapia is an omnivorous fish with some advantages on chitin degradation, because polysaccharides are part of the composition zooplanktons, a natural feed for tilapia [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The ability to degrade chitin from insect and shrimp meal through the presence of chitinolytic enzymes from pancreatic and gastric mucosa has already been clarified for some teleost fish species [

 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Considering tilapiaÂ´s possible advantages in chitin degradation and its omnivorous feeding habits [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], insect meal are expected to become a feasible feed for Nile tilapia fingerlings. As the ADC provides information about how much a fish has digested and retained a feed, knowing the digestibility of novel dietary ingredients is the basis to assess their bioavailability and hence their sustainability for inclusion in fish diets.
