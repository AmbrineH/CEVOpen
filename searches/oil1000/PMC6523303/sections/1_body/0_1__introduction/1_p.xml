<p class="p">The use of alternative ingredients in aquaculture feeds is intended to minimize the dependence on scarce, expensive or unsustainable feedstuff. The main ingredients traditionally used in fish feed are commodities whose price is set by the inconstant global supply and demand. Soybean meal is one of the most used vegetal protein sources in aquafeed formulation due to its high protein content, and amino acid profile as well as its price [
