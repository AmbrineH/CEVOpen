<p class="p">Chemical analyses of the test ingredients, diets and feces were conducted according to Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC) [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] for dry matter (930.15), crude protein (968.06) and ash (942.05). The chemical composition of the insect meals and diets are shown in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00181-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00181-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, respectively. Corrected crude protein was determined by the Kjeldahl method; however, the nitrogen-to-protein correction factor used was 4.76 (Kp = 4.76) instead of the usual 6.25, as described by Janssen et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], in which nitrogen from chitin are not considered. Crude lipid was quantified following Folch’s [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] methodology and chitin according to Souto’s [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Gross energy was measured in a calorimetric bomb (IKA C7000, Staufen, Germany) and chromium oxide following Bremer Neto et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>].
