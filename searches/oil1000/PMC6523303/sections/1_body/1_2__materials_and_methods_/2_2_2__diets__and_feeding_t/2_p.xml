<p class="p">The fish diets comprised 20% test ingredient (insect meals) and 80% control diet (commercial diet with 32% crude protein, Linha aquos Tropical––TOTAL) with 0.1% chromium oxide (Cr
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) as an inert marker. The control diet was used as the reference diet, and the data collected from this group was used to calculate the test ingredient’s ADCs, as described below. After 10 days of adaptation to laboratory conditions, the fish were fed three times daily to the point of apparent satiation for 15 days with the experimental diets, with an average of 18 g of feed per feeding per tank. After the last daily feeding, tanks were cleaned and plastic tubes connected at the bottom of each tank for feces collection overnight, for 15 days. The next morning, the tubes were removed and feces dried in a forced-air drying oven (60 °C) for 48 h and stored in a freezer (−20 °C) for laboratory analysis.
