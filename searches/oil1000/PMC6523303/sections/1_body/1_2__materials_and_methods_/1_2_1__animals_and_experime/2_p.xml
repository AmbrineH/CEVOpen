<p class="p">An in vivo digestibility trial was performed to assess the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of the dietary nutrients and energy. The feeding trial was carried out at the Experimental Aquaculture Station of the Animal Science Department at the Federal University of Lavras in a completely randomized design with six dietary treatments (one control with no insect meal and five insect meals) and three replicates (fiberglass cylindro-conic tanks with 250 L capacity) each containing 50 reversed male Nile Tilapia fingerlings 
 <italic class="italic">Oreochromis niloticus</italic> (3.0 ± 0.2 g of mean weight). The trial was set up in a recirculating system adapted to the Guelph system, equipped with a fiber mesh pad filter, a submerged biological filter and an ultraviolet filter. The system was supplied with constant aeration, and thermoregulation (26 ± 1 °C). Oxygen saturation in the water was 85% ± 2%; the ammonia and nitrite concentration amounted to 0.2 ± 0.1 and 0.3 ± 0.1 mg/L, respectively. A 12-h light/dark cycle was adopted.
