  <p class="p">Insects can be a source of nutrients for aquatic organisms, replacing scarce or unsustainable foods. The diversity of insect species contributes to their variable nutritional composition, which fish may digest differently. Nile tilapia is a very important fish for aquaculture, which requires great quantities of quality protein and other dietary nutrients on its initial rearing phase. Therefore, it is important to better understand the technical feasibility of using insect meal as a nutrient and energy source for Nile tilapia fingerlings. In this study, 
   <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae meal showed the highest apparent digestibility coefficient, being attested as a potential alternative feed for Nile tilapia fingerlings. Those findings may contribute to sustainable development of the tilapia production around the world.

  <p class="p">Insects are a valuable source of nutrients for fish, but little is known about their nutritional value for Nile tilapia fingerlings. To evaluate the nutritional value and energy apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of five insects for Nile Tilapia male fingerlings, 900 fish were distributed in 18 fiberglass conic tanks, in a completely randomized design, with six dietary treatments (control, 
   <italic class="italic">Nauphoeta cinerea</italic> meal (NCM) (Blattodea), 
   <italic class="italic">Zophobas morio</italic> larvae meal (ZMM) (Coleptera), 
   <italic class="italic">Gromphadorhina portentosa</italic> meal (GPM) (Blattodea), 
   <italic class="italic">Gryllus assimilis</italic> meal (GAM) (Orthoptera) and 
   <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae meal (TMM) (Coleptera)) and three replicates (tanks), each containing 50 fish. The control diet had no insect meal included and the other five treatments comprised 80% commercial diet and 20% test ingredient with 0.1% chromic oxide as an inert marker. TMM presented a higher ADC for dry matter, protein, corrected protein and chitin than to other treatments (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). GPM presented the highest ADC for lipids (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). In general, the TMM presented better ADC of nutrients and energy and all the insect meals evaluated are potential feed for Nile tilapia fingerlings.
