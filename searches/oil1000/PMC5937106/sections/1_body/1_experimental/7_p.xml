<p class="p">Solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) of the leaf of 
 <italic class="italic">A. chamaecistus </italic>was performed in a Milestone ETHOM 1600 batch reactor, which is a multimode microwave reactor operating at 2455 MHz with a maximum delivered power of 1000 W, variable in 10 W increments. The dimensions of the PTFE coated cavity are 35×35×35 cm. During the experiment, time temperature, pressure, and power were controlled using the «easy-WAVE» Software package. Temperature was monitored with the aid of a shielded thermocouple (ATC- 300) inserted directly in to the sample container.
