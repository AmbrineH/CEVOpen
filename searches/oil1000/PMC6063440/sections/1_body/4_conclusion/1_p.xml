<p class="p">The principal finding of this study is the Th1 and Th2 immunomodulatory properties of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil. 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> and LPS can induce production of chemical mediators in monocyte-derived DCs and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> influenced both 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>- and LPS-induced Th1 and Th2 polarization of CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells. However, only IL-6 and TNF-Î± production induced by 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> was inhibited with 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic>. Because the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil influenced both 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>-induced DC activation and Th2 polarization, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> may more strongly inhibit Th2 immune response. These results suggest a novel pharmacological use of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil for treating fungus-induced Th2 inflammatory airway diseases. We need further study to confirm the inhibitory properties of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil in Th2 immune response with other airborne allergens and its possible anti-allergic effects with allergic animal models.
