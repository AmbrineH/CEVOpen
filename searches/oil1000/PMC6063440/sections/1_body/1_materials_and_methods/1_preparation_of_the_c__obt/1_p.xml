<p class="p">Qwell Inc. (Seoul, South Korea) kindly presented Microencapsulated 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil; it was isolated from leaves collected in Masan, Kyunsangnamdo, South Korea. The leaves dried under shade, and using the seam distillation and extraction methods, they extracted essential oil from the leaves. The collected essential oil was stored at room temperature for one year to stabilize its components. The chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil was determined using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis (Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Essential oil contained more than 20 components and the main chemical composition of

 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil is in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201233.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. For microencapsulation, they emulsified the oil by mixing it with a water-soluble stylene maleic anhydride polymer in water and then adding melanin pre-condensate to the mixture, resulting in the formation of microcapsules consisting of a spherical inner core and an outer shell surrounding the inner core.
