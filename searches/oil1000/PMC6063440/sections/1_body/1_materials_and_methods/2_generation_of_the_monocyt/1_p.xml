<p class="p">We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal healthy volunteers after they provided informed consent. The procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Daegu Catholic University Medical Center. A duly completed written informed consent form that outlined the objectives of the research and experiments was obtained from each subject. The cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). We harvested cells from the interphase and washed them with phosphate-buffered solution, and then we mixed the PBMCs with anti-CD14 antibody conjugated with magnetic particles (Miltenyl Biotec, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 4Â°C for 30 minutes to obtain monocytes. We cultured the positively collected cells with 25 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 10 ng/ml of interleukin-4 (IL-4; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After 6 days of culture, we harvested the DC-enriched portion and analyzed as previously reported. [
