 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil on the production of cytokines in DCs to 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> and LPS stimulation with ELISA and the expression of cell surface molecules with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). For cytokine analysis, we analyzed cell-free supernatants for IL-6 and TNF-Î± with a commercially available ELISA assay kit (R&amp;D Systems). For FACS analysis, the DCs were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD11c and FITC-conjugated anti-CD 80, anti-CD 86, and anti-HLA-DR and with corresponding isotype-matched control monoclonal antibodies. We obtained all antibodies used for FACS analysis from Becton Dickinson and conducted the analysis with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). We expressed the mean fluorescence intensities of costimulatory molecules as a percentage of treated versus non-treated cells.
