<p class="p">We measured the effects of the essential oil on CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells polarization based on cytokine production by culturing monocyte-derived DCs and autologous CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells. We isolated the CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells by treating the PBMCs with anti-CD4 antibody conjugated with magnetic particles (Miltenyl Biotec). We cultured CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells at a ratio of 10:1 with stimulated DCs pulsed with
