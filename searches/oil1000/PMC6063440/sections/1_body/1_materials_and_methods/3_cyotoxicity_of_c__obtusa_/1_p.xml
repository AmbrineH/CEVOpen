<p class="p">We determined the cellular cytotoxicity of the microencapsulated essential oil with monocyte-derived DCs and CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells. Cells were plated into the wells of 96-well tissue culture plates (DCs at 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>/mL, CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells at 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>/mL,) and cultured in the presence of 0.05 to 1% of essential oil (DCs for 24 hours, CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells for 72 hours) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 chamber. We measured cytotoxicity using a CellTiter-96
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> aqueous cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The tetrazolium compound and Owen’s reagent were added to each well and incubated the plate for 4 hours, and the color intensities were assessed with a microplate reader at 490 nm wavelength (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
