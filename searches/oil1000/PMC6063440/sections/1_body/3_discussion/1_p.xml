 <xref rid="pone.0201233.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] Because essential oils are volatile, microencapsulation of essential oils can protect the active compounds against environmental factors such as oxygen, light, and moisture. This microcapsulation also protects the oil from degradation or evaporation and increases their solubility in water. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201233.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] C. obtusa plain oil was about 10 times toxic to respiratory epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells than microencapsulated oil. (data not shown) The plain oil compounds might be more volatile and active than microencapsulated one. Stylene maleic anhydride polymer is a synthetic polymer and it has been used as a sealer coat prior to modified release coating and food packing material listed by FDA. [
