 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> induced Th1, Th2, and Th10 immune responses, particulary of the Th2 cytokine IL-5 (by approximately 5 times compared with negative control). Although we attempted to remove endotoxins from 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> extracts, the 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> preparation contained some endotoxin activity (3.7 EU/mg), and the IL-10 and INF-γ production could have been influenced by the endotoxin components in the

 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil suppressed Th1, Th2, and Th10 cytokines in CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells. Among three cytokines, IL-5 production was most strongly suppressed (IL-5: 75%, INF-γ: 41%, and IL-10: 44%). These results indicate that the essential oil of

 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> may influence the inhibition of Th2 immune response. IL-6 produced from DCs can suppress Th1 polarization and directly induce Th2 differentiation of naïve T cells. [

 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> did not significantly affect LPS-induced DC activation and LPS-treated DCs enhanced the Th1 cytokine production in CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells, which means that 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil can influence both Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Because we did not evaluate any immunoregulatory properties of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic>, additional studies are necessary to determine whether down-regulation of IL-6 is sufficient to inhibit Th2 polarization of CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells or ILS-induced Th1 polarization.
