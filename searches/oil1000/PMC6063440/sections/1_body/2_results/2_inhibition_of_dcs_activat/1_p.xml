<p class="p">We pretreated the DCs with the essential oil for 1 hour, and then stimulated them with 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> or LPS for 6 hours. DCs had been reported to produce IL-6 and TNF-α, and these cytokines play important roles in regulating T cell differentiation and inflammation. 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> and LPS significantly increased the production of IL-6 (
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>: 410.9 ± 52.7 pg/ml, LPS: 711.6 ± 122.3 pg/ml) and TNF-α (
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>: 1007.2 ± 253.7 pg/ml, LPS: 2837.6 ± 357.2 pg/ml) compared with the untreated group (IL-6: 255.6 ± 43.6 pg/ml, TNF-α: 752.6 ± 176.6 pg/ml; p &lt; 0.05). When the DCs were pretreated with 0.001, 0.01, and 0.05% of the oil, 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> induced IL-6 and TNF-α productions were significantly inhibited. However, the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil did not suppress either LPS-induced IL-6 or TNF-α productions (
