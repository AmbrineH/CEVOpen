<p class="p">In order to determine the optimal concentration of essential oil, we treated DCs and the CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells for 24 and 72 hours with different concentration of the essential oil. The DCs’ viability decreased significantly with an oil concentration of 0.1% (82.3 ± 7.9 after 6 hours and 67.3 ± 6.4 after 24 hours). The exposure time did not influence the DCs’ survival. When the CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells were treated with 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, and 1% of essential oil for 24, 48, and 72 hours, CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells survival decreased significantly with 0.5% and 1% of the oil, and again the exposure time did not influence cell viability (
