<p class="p">We purified autologous CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells to coculture them with the DCs. To determine the effects of the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">C obtusa</italic>, we pretreated the DCs with the oil for 1 hour and stimulated with 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> or LPS for 24 hours, then we cocultured the DCs with CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells for 72 hours. 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> and LPS enhanced the production of IL-5, IL-10, and INF-γ from the CD4
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells. 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>-induced cytokine production was significantly inhibited with the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil in a dose-dependent manner. LPS-induced INF-γ production was significantly inhibited with the essential oil, but the oil did not inhibit LPS-induced IL-10 production from CD4
