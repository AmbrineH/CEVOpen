<p class="p">A number of environmental factors are associated with allergic airway disease. House dust mites and mold are significant airborne allergens for developing allergic rhinitis and asthma. Most fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, and they enter the respiratory tract by means of inhalation. Among several pathogenic fungi, 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> are commonly found in the airway and trigger airway diseases. [

 <xref rid="pone.0201233.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] Fungi contain several immunologic factors that are potent regulators of the host immune response. These immunologic factors, with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, interact with pattern recognition receptors in antigen-presenting cells. [

For example, inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) initiate antifungal response in the Th17 and Th2 signaling pathways, and tolerogenic DCs activate Th1 and Treg cell immune response. [

 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> can develop Th2-type immune response in the airway by activating dendritic cells. [
