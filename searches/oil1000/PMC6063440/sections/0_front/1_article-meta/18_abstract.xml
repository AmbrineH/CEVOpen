 <p class="p">The essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Chamaecyparis obtusa</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic>), which is used in soap, toothpaste, and aromatic agents, has been known to have anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of microencapsulated 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil on airborne fungus-induced dendritic cell (DC) activation and Th immune responses. We stimulated monocyte-derived DCs with 
  <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> alternate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To determine the anti-inflammatory effects, we pre-treated DCs with various concentrations of microencapsulated 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil and collected the supernatants to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and we determined the expression of cell surface molecules. The effects of the essential oil on CD4
  <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells polarization was determine by culturing stimulated DCs and autologous CD4
  <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells. 
  <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> enhanced the production of IL-6 and TNF-α from DCs, and pretreating DCs with 0.001, 0.01, and 0.05% of the essential oil significantly inhibited their production. Increased CD80 and CD86 expression by 
  <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> was significantly inhibited with 0.05% of the essential oil. 
  <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>-induced IL-5, IL-10, and interferon-gamma from CD4
  <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells were significantly inhibited with 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil in a dose dependent manner. 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> influenced both 
  <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>- and LPS-induced Th1 and Th2 polarization of CD4
  <sup class="sup">+</sup> T cells. These results suggest a novel pharmacological use for 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">obtusa</italic> essential oil to treat inflammatory airway diseases.
