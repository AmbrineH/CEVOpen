 <p> Effects of C. obtusa essential oil on dendritic cells (DCs) stimulated with Alternaria 50 ug/ml (Alt 50) and lipopolysaccharide 1 ug/ml (LPS 1) induced distinctive cytokines from autologous CD4 + T cells. Alternaria-induced interleukin-5 (IL-5), interferon gamma (INF-γ), and IL-10 production and LPS-induced INF-γ production were significantly inhibited with various concentrations (0.001–0.01%) of C. obtusa. NT: not treated with essential oil, * p &lt; 0.05 vs. NC, Ɨ: p &lt; 0.05 vs. Alt 50 or LPS 1. </p>
