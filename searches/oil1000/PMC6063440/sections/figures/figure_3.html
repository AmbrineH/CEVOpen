 <p> Effects of C. obtusa essential oil on expression of co-stimulatory molecules by dendritic cells (DCs) and chemical mediator production from DCs. Alternaria 50 ug/ml (Alt 50) and lipopolysaccharide 1 ug/ml (LPS 1) significantly enhanced CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR expression, but 0.05% of the essential oil (EO0.05) only inhibited the expression of CD80 and CD86. (A) Representative flow cytometric histograms show expression of costimulatory molecules incubated with Alternaria alone or with EO0.005 pretreatment. (B) Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels are shown from five independent experiments. NT: not treated with essential oil, * p &lt; 0.05 vs. NC, Æ—: p &lt; 0.05 vs. Alt 50 or LPS 1. </p>
