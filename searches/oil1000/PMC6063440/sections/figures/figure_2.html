 <p> Effects of C. obtusa essential oil on chemical mediator production from dendritic cells (DCs). When DCs were pretreated with various concentrations (0.001–0.05%) of C. obtusa, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by Alternaria 50 ug/ml (Alt 50) was significantly inhibited. However, chemical mediator production induced by lipopolysaccharide 1 ug/ml (LPS 1) was not inhibited. NT: not treated with essential oil, * p &lt; 0.05 vs. NC, Ɨ: p &lt; 0.05 vs. Alt 50 or LPS 1. </p>
