<p class="p">CLA has attracted significant attention due to anticarcinogenic and lipid/energy metabolism-modulatory effects; however, the concentration in foodstuffs is insufficient for any therapeutic application to be implemented. In this study, through refining lipid accumulation, integrating overexpression of diacylglycerol transferase (DGA1), Î”12 desaturase (MA12D) and 
 <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</italic> isomerase (PAI), and optimizing culture conditions (carbon and nitrogen source, carbon to nitrogen mass ratio, CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content), the maximum achieved CLA content and lipid yield of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> Po1g were 132.6 mg/L and 2.58 g/L, respectively. This is the first report of the production of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-10, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 CLA by the oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> using glycerol as the sole carbon source through expression of DGA1 combined with MA12D and PAI. This is the first report on CLA synthesis and the highest obtained CLA titer using glycerol as the sole carbon source in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> in shake-flask cultures. Therefore, an alternative production system for CLA from inexpensive and renewable sources of glycerol through metabolic engineering methods in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> has been demonstrated. The novel CLA synthesis pathway had two distinct characteristics: a higher CLA titer and utilization of inexpensive raw glycerol. It was difficult to obtain CLA because of its low concentration and complex composition in foodstuffs. However, crude glycerol was inexpensively and easily obtained from biodiesel production. Thus, it is meaningful to reconstruct a recombinant strain for CLA production from crude glycerol. In this study, a recombinant strain was constructed for enhanced lipid accumulation and efficient CLA production from crude glycerol. Simultaneously, a complete CLA synthesis pathway was developed, which could be widely used for the synthesis of additional value-added fatty acid derivatives. In conclusion, a high value-added compound CLA that can be produced from glycerol by 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> is shown to represent a valuable contribution to the development of a cost-effective fermentation method based on renewable resources.
