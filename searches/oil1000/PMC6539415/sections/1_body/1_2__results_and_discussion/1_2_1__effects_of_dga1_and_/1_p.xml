<p class="p">Biosynthesis of lipids and their derivatives is a complex and tightly regulated metabolic undertaking. More and more literature has reported that the 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">GPD1</italic> genes serve important roles in lipid accumulation. Recently, Tai et al. have shown that overexpression of DGA1 yielded a 4-fold increase in lipid production over control [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In this study, to implement the identified target, the copy numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">GPD1</italic> were increased in the 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> genome, respectively, using a constitutive hp4d promoter which had been widely used in recent years [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. For the rapid screening of high-yield oleaginous yeast, WXYL010, WXYL015 and Po1h were stained with Nile Red and their fluorescence intensity at 520 nm compared (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-01753" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>). In a lipid-rich environment, Nile Red can emit intense fluorescence with varying colors from deep red (for polar membrane lipids) to strong yellow-gold emission (for neutral lipids within intracellular storages). The results indicated that enhancing some key genes which link to the accumulation of lipids has effectively improved the lipid content in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic>. Next, the effects of overexpression of DGA1 and GPD1 on lipid production in WXYL010 and WXYL015 strains were assessed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). With glycerol as the sole carbon substrate, the wild strain Po1h produced 1.86 g/L lipid. It was found that the lipid titer of recombinant strains WXYL010 and WXYL015, which harbor DGA1 or GPD1 genes, both exceeded the wild strain Po1h, accumulating 2.60 g/L and 1.95 g/L lipid, respectively. Moreover, compared to the WXYL015 strain, the WXYL010 strain achieved higher titer values demonstrating up to 40% increases in production over the wild strain. It is probable that glycerol, as the sole carbon source, can be fully utilized by the glycerol kinase (Gut1) instead of GPD1, which can only convert DHAP to G3P. It is worth noting that significant increases of lipid content have been achieved when overexpressing DGA1, which exerts a direct catalytic effect on DAG to form TAG. These results demonstrated that increased 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> copy number can enhance metabolite levels and subsequently improve the efficiency of lipid production.
