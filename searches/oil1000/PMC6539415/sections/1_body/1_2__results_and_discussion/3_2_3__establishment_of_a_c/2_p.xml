<p class="p">As a result, the CLA has emerged and accounts for 3.3% of intracellular lipids, with a yield of 54.8 mg/L (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Comparing 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> Po1h strain with WXYL030, there is no significant change in the relative content of other lipid components. Meanwhile, hp4d-
 <italic class="italic">PAI</italic> (pWX030) was used for the tandem gene construction of 
 <italic class="italic">PAI+MA12D</italic> (pWX034) and 
 <italic class="italic">PAI</italic>+
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic>+
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> (pWX037), respectively. The recombinant strains WXYL034 and WXYL037 both exceeded WXYL030, accumulating 68.2 mg/L and 110.6 mg/L of CLA, respectively. The CLA yield of the WXYL034 strain is approximately one-quarter more than that of WXYL030; at the same time, the content of methyl palmitoleate (C16:1) was also slightly enhanced, and methyl stearate (C18:0) was decreased compared to wild-type strains. This phenomenon further proves the hypothesis that oleic acid dehydrogenase exerts certain side effects on stearic acid and palmitic acid. The WXYL037 strain coexpression of 
 <italic class="italic">PAI</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> genes ultimately obtained the maximum CLA yield of 110.6 mg/L, which is the highest output of CLA by 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> yet reported using glycerol as the sole carbon substrate.
