<p class="p">The free fatty acids in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> are primarily oleic acid and linoleic acid. Sun et al. reported a recombinant strain which produced γ-LA at titers of 71.6 mg/L through heterologous expression of a heterologous desaturase gene [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In this study, to increase the proportion of unsaturated LA in lipids, therefore the 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic> gene was introduced into 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> Po1g, resulting in the WXYL020 strain. It was found that the transformant indeed showed a significant increase in LA content. The content of LA was increased from 26% to 34%, eventually reaching 0.58 g/L, and it was interesting to note that the content of methyl palmitoleate (C16:1) was also slightly enhanced; however, the methyl stearate (C18:0) content was decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A). This could be caused by various side reactions of Δ12 desaturase with stearic acid and palmitic acid and the dehydrogenation of oleic acid. It is speculated that this enzyme may catalyze the dehydrogenation of stearic acid and palmitic acid to oleic acid and palmitoleic acid, respectively. The increased copy number of the 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> gene in the genome of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> provides an excellent platform for high yields of lipid production. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic> were expressed in tandem within the WXYL025 strain: the content of LA was maintained at 34%, and the lipid accumulation reached up to 50% of its dry cell weight (DCW), at which time the LA yield reached 0.88 g/L (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B). The result showed that co-expression of two genes, 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic>, further improved the content of LA on the foundation of high lipid titers.
