 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>D), under optimal conditions, the cell concentration increased rapidly within 0~30 h, which represented the logarithmic growth phase of yeast. After 30 h, yeast cells entered a stable growth phase. CLA is generally produced at the end of logarithmic growth, and the titer of CLA reached 132.6 mg/L and 5.2% of total fatty acid yield in transformed

In view of these observations, the research provides an excellent strategy for the commercialization of inexpensive glycerol into higher value products by engineering the oleaginous yeast
