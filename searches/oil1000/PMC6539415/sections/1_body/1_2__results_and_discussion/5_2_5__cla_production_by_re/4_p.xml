<p class="p">Finally, the concepts of optimization of high-density fermentation towards the final product are prominent strategies for the generation of desirable products in industrial applications. Zhang et al. reported that total CLA production in the fermenter using YNBD-SO medium (2% dextrose and 2% soybean oil as carbon source) was almost 4 g/L, about 90 times higher compared to that using YPD medium in shaking flask cultures (45 mg/L). The primary reason for the high CLA production of the 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> strain may lie in the YNBD-SO medium resulting from the converting of cosubstrate soybean oil into CLA by PAI and lipase [
