<p class="p">Another possibility is further employing a chromosome integration technique to strengthen the copy number and transcription intensity of recombinant genes [

 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> vectors offer the possibility of multiple integrations and of a correlated increase in gene expression. Furthermore, the expression of the heterologous gene were driven by the constitutive hp4d promoter, which consists of regulatory element 4 *UAS1B and core promoter LEU2. There is a linear relationship between the number of UAS1B regulatory elements and the regulation intensity of promoter. The more UAS1B inserted upstream of LEU2, the higher the expression of proteins regulated by promoter [
