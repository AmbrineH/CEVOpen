<p class="p">During CLA accumulation, the carbon to nitrogen mass ratio (C/N) in the medium represents an important factor affecting the CLA yield [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The C/N ratio has already been investigated as a key factor for CLA accumulation, and it is worth noting that the cells are primarily based on their own proliferation when the nitrogen supply in the medium is rich. Instead, the cells may enter the apoptotic phase in advance when the nitrogen composition is insufficient. As shown in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>B), the highest CLA production yield was achieved at the C/N ratio of 50:1, reaching 119.1 mg/L, which was improved by approximately 54% as opposed to that at the C/N ratio of 25:1.
