<p class="p">The growth of oleaginous yeast usually passes through the cell proliferation phase, the oil accumulation period, and the citric acid accumulation period. For 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic>, exogenous genes are generally expressed towards the end of the logarithmic growth phase of cell growth, in which case a large amount of nitrogen source is required. Similarly, the nitrogen source is also one of the essential components for microbial growth. For obtaining the highest CLA contents, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, tryptone, bacterial peptone, and soy peptone were selected as nitrogen sources (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A). It is obvious that organic nitrogen sources led to greater amounts of obtained biomass and lipid contents than inorganic nitrogen sources in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic>. Simultaneously, the biomass and CLA contents obtained by the use of three kinds of organic nitrogen sources are similar, the CLA yield were about 109.8 mg/L, and the most inexpensive organic nitrogen source soy peptone was ultimately selected.
