<p class="p">To investigate the effect of the carbon source on lipid production, glucose, different grades of glycerol and waste oil were assessed. Altogether, the results indicate that WXYL037 using waste oils as the carbon source exhibit higher lipid formation/DCW (accumulated 0.56 g lipid/g DCW). Considering the instability and complex components of waste oil sources, waste oils were not chosen as a suitable carbon source of WXYL037. Meanwhile, lipid formation/DCW of WXYL037 on glycerol or crude glycerol, which was 0.49 g lipid/g DCW, were similar to those obtained on glucose (data not shown). Furthermore, the industrial production of glucose mainly depends on the hydrolysis of starch, which is not enough to meet the human needs of food production. In comparison, the production of raw glycerol has increased significantly due to its status as the principle side-product of biodiesel. The uniformity of the production process of biodiesel results in nearly the same composition of crude glycerol [
