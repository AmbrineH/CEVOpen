 <italic class="italic">Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> has been considered as a potential candidate as a platform organism for superior CLA production, owing to its high lipid production rate (approaching 90% of cell dry weight) with a high proportion of oleic acid (OA, 18:1) and LA in the fatty acid composition and clear genetic background [

The intracellular lipids of this yeast are primarily OA and LA, of which OA accounts for approximately 50% of the total fatty acid content and LA accounts for nearly 15–20% of the total fatty acid content [
