<p class="p">Due to its well-studied lipid metabolism, the significant array of genetic tools and a fully sequenced genome, 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> has become a model oleaginous yeast for the production of lipids and lipid-derived biofuels. The use of the oleaginous yeast 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> benefits from its well-developed tools for engineering the lipid metabolic pathway, and this species can transform inexpensive raw glycerol derived from biodiesel production into high-value products such as CLA. In addition to glucose or fats, raw glycerol can serve as the sole carbon for 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> generation of a large amount of high value-added chemicals, such as gamma-LA, ricinoleic acid and omega-3-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Meanwhile, global biodiesel production in 2014 was approximately 29.7 billion liters, and the primary byproduct glycerol, which accounts for nearly 10% of biodiesel production, is as affordable as $0.24 per kilogram [

 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> follows the Kennedy pathway [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. First, the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) molecule is either synthesized from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), catalyzed by NAD
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], or derived from glycerol via glycerol kinase (GUT1). Then, G3P is acylated by G3P acyltransferase (SCT1) and catalyzed by LPA acyltransferase (SLC1) to yield phosphatidic acid (PA). After that, diacylglycerol (DAG) is generated through dephosphorylation of PA by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP). In the final step, TAG is produced either by diacylglycerol transferase (DGA1), with acyl-CoA as an acyl donor, or by phospholipid DAG acyltransferase (LRO1), with phospholipid (PL) as an acyl donor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01753-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the TAG accumulated in cells can be further hydrolyzed into glycerol and free fatty acids (FFA) by endogenous lipases to provide raw materials for the synthesis of additional products while also providing energy for cell growth [

 <italic class="italic">t</italic>10, 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>12-CLA [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Zhang et al. reported that the highest titer of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>10, 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>12-CLA, 45 mg/L, was obtained in genetically modified 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> by introducing PAI and MA12D using YPD medium in shaking flask cultures after 72 h cultivation [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. During this study, in order to further improve the contents of lipid and CLA in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> from non-oil substrates, the copy numbers of pivotal genes, GPD1 or DGA1, were increased, this provides an enhanced driving force towards production of lipid. Subsequently, raw glycerol was utilized as carbon source to overproduce CLA in 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> by modifying the lipid accumulation pathway and heterologously expressing MA12D and PAI.
