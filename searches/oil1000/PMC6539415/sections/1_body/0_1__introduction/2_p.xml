<p class="p">A sustainable alternative is to produce CLA directly from abundant and renewable resources through metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches, which presents numerous advantages such as a short preparation cycle, less labor requirement, reduced impacts of place, season and climate compared to others methods [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]; however, one of the challenges is developing a microbial catalyst for high product yields from inexpensive raw materials. A number of microorganisms have been identified as potential CLA producers. However, the levels of CLA production are relatively low [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. It is well known that CLA is generally produced from LA through LA isomerase. The cytosolic LA isomerase derived from

 <italic class="italic">c</italic>12-CLA is the only isomerase that has been successfully expressed in multiple plants and microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, the high price of LA limits its use as a raw material for CLA preparation. In the previous study, vegetable oils, which are rich in oleic acid and LA, have been proven useful as feedstocks for CLA production. Synergistic catalytic systems based on immobilized PAI and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus oryzae</italic> lipase (ROL) were developed for converting plant oil into CLA, and the corresponding conversion ratio of LA to CLA was 90.5% [
