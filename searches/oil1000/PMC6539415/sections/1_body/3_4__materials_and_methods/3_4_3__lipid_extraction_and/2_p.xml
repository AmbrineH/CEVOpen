<p class="p">FAMEs analysis was performed with a GC-7890A (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a PEG-20M capillary column (0.32 mm × 30 m × 0.25 μm) and a flame-ionization detector (FID). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas, and the total gas flow rate was 2 mL/min. The samples were measured with a split ratio of 15:1 with the injector and detector temperatures set to 205 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The column temperature was maintained at 120 °C for 1 min, then increased to 190 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, further raised to 205 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min, and then maintained at 205 °C for 3 min. Methyl esters of LA and

 <italic class="italic">c</italic>12-CLA were identified by comparisons with authentic FAMEs standards (CLA methyl ester, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Heptadecanoic acid methyl ester (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as an internal standard. Total lipid content was calculated as the sum of total fatty acid contents for five FAMEs: methyl palmitate (C16:0), methyl palmitoleate (C16:1), methyl stearate (C18:0), methyl oleate (C18:1), and methyl linoleate (C18:2). The LA concentration in plant oils is defined as the percentage of LA methyl esters versus the total amount of FAMEs in the plant oil. CLA yields were calculated using the follow equation: CLA conversion ratio (%) = (content of CLA/content of lipid) × 100%. CLA yield (mg/L) = (content of lipid × CLA conversion ratio)/volume of culture broth.
