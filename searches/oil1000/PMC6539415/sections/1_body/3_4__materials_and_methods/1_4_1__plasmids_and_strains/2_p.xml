<p class="p">The codon-optimized 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic> with the sequence GCCACA added before the start codon to create a Kozak sequence [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] was chemically synthesized and cloned into pINA1267, yielding the pWX020 plasmid. The 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> gene and a modified hp4d promoter [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] were inserted downstream of 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic> in pWX020, yielding the pWX025 plasmid. The gene encoding PAI was cloned from the pET20b-PAI plasmid, which was preserved in laboratory, and cloned into pINA1312 [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01753" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], yielding the pWX030 plasmid. The DNA cassette containing the hp4d promoter and the 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic> gene were inserted downstream of the 
 <italic class="italic">PAI</italic> gene in pWX030, yielding the pWX034 plasmid. In the same way, the DNA cassettes containing 
 <italic class="italic">MA12D</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">DGA1</italic> genes, with each possessing the hp4d promoter were inserted downstream of the 
 <italic class="italic">PAI</italic> gene in pWX030, yield the pWX037 plasmid.
