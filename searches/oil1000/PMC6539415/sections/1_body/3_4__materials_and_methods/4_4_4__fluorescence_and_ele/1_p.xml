Samples were activated under 488 nm light, and fluorescence emission spectra of samples were analyzed under 520 nm irradiation by a Cytation3 cell imaging microplate detector (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). An Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Industrial, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture fluorescence images with a 100 ~ 1000 × oil-immersion objective.
