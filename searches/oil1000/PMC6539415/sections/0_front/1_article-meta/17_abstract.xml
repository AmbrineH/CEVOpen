 <p class="p">A novel recombinant strain has been constructed for converting glycerol into a specific conjugated linoleic acid isomer (
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-10, 
  <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 CLA) using 
  <italic class="italic">Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> as host. The lipid accumulation pathway was modified for increasing lipid content. Overexpression of the diacylglycerol transferase (DGA1) gene improved the intracellular lipid yield by approximately 45% as compared to the original strain. The corresponding intracellular lipid yield of recombinant strain WXYL037 reached 52.2% of the cell dry weight. In combination with integration of Î”12 desaturase from 
  <italic class="italic">Mortierella alpina</italic> (MA12D) and DGA1, the linoleic acid (LA) production content reached 0.88 g/L, which was 2-fold that of the original strain. Furthermore, with overexpressed DGA1, MA12D and 
  <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</italic> isomerase (PAI), the titer of 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-10, 
  <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 CLA in WXYL037 reached 110.6 mg/L after 72 h of shake flask culture, representing a 201.8% improvement when compared with that attained in the WXYL030 strain, which manifested overexpressed PAI. With optimal medium, the maximum CLA content and lipid yield of 
  <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> Po1g were 132.6 mg/L and 2.58 g/L, respectively. This is the first report of the production of 
  <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-10, 
  <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 CLA by the oleaginous yeast 
  <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> using glycerol as the sole carbon source through expression of DGA1 combined with MA12D and PAI.
