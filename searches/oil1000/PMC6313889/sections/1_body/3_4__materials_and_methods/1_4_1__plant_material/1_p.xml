<p class="p">Thirty-eight sweet almond genotypes cultivated in Sardinia and seven reference almond cultivars cultivated worldwide were included in this study (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00086-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These were obtained from the collection maintained by the Sardinian Research Agency (Agenzia per la Ricerca in Agricoltura della Regione Autonoma della Sardegna), Uta, Italy. The plants were grafted into the GF677 rootstock and planted in soil during winter 1989. The trellis system is multi-conical goblet and the plants are 6 Ã— 6 m spaced. The soil is sandy-clay (42% sand) with pH 7.4. The field is cover cropped; weeds along the row are controlled by herbicide application (Roundup). Irrigation on the rows is done by a drip irrigation system from late June to September, depending on the weather conditions.
