<p class="p">The fruit and phenological traits were recorded during 2011â€“2013 from samples harvested from three plants (replicates) of each almond genotype. For each genotype, 15 fruits from three replicate plants were considered. The samples from the same genotype were pooled together before morphological determinations. Thus, Sardinian and reference cultivars were analyzed according to the almond descriptors developed by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (now known as Bioversity International;

 <xref rid="B45-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]). The three parameters were detected on 1-year branches (one for each cardinal point) and calculated as 5% opened flowers (initial flowering), 50% opened flowers (max flowering), and 50% of flowers with fallen petals (final flowering). The productive traits were nut and kernel weight (g), kernel percentage, and percentage of nuts without a kernel. The morphological fruit traits were percentage of double kernel, nut length (cm) and width (cm), and kernel length (cm) and width (cm).
