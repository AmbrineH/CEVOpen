<p class="p">The SSR alleles chosen here were the same as those used by Rigoldi et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The genetic relationships among the genotypes were analyzed using a model based on a Bayesian clustering approach, as implemented in the STRUCTURE 2.2 software [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. For each K value, 20 runs were carried out (100,000 burn-in generations, 200,000 Markov chain generations). The most likely K was determined following Evanno et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and Kopelman et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. All of the statistical analyses were carried out using the JMP version 7 software (SAS Institute Inc. 2007, Cary, NC, USA).
