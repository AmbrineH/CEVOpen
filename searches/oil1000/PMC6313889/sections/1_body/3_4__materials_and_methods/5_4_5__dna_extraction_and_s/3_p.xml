<p class="p">The thermal cycling program for UDP and CCPT SSR was composed of: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at the temperature of annealing (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-07-00086" class="xref">Table S3</xref>), and 45 s at 72 °C. The thermal program was closed by a final step of 8 min at 72 °C. For BBCT SSR, the initial extension was for 60 s at 94 °C, the annealing step was 45 s at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C was for extension. The amplicons were separated using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) to estimate fragment lengths based on the migration of Genescan
