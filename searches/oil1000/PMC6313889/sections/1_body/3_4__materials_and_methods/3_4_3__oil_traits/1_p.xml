<p class="p">The fruits of each genotype were collected over the three consecutive seasons (i.e., in September 2011, 2012, 2013). The kernels were peeled and then ground in a coffee mill. The flour from each replicate was sieved through an 18-mesh (1 mm diameter) sieve. The dry matter content (dry weight) was calculated for 5 g aliquots of kernel flour after oven-drying overnight at 105 °C. The kernel oil content was expressed as the percentage of the kernel dry weight. The following fatty acids were determined as percentages of total oil content: palmitic and stearic acids (i.e., saturated fatty acids), oleic and palmitoleic acids (i.e., monounsaturated fatty acids), linoleic and

The oil was extracted from another 5 g aliquot of each kernel flour through treatment with 80–100 mL petroleum ether (30–50 °C) for 4 h in a Soxhlet extraction apparatus. The petroleum extracts containing the lipids were distilled in a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. Finally, the lipid weight was determined after evaporation of the residual ether under a flow of N2 gas. The total lipid percentages were calculated according to the dry matter determined for the (separately determined) 5 g aliquot of flour. The fatty acids in the oil samples were converted to their corresponding methyl esters. For this,
