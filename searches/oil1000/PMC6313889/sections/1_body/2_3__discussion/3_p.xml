<p class="p">It is important to underline that fatty acid content and the composition of kernels can be significantly influenced by the environment. Hence, the comparison of data obtained from different years or experimental sites should be always considered with caution. Indeed, we have found that the factor year significantly affected several morphological and commercial traits. Several studies have demonstrated that the heritability of oil content and composition of almond kernels is rather high, and thus, the kernel oil content and composition is expected to be substantially determined by the genetic background of the almond cultivars [

We found that the cultivar was the main determinant of the total oil content of the kernels, while the year was the main factor for most oil components. It is very important to underline that also the interaction cultivar x year was of moderate entity, though significant, for all oil components analyzed, a finding in substantial agreement with data reported by other studies [
