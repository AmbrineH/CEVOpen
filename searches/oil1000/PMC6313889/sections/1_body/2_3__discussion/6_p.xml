<p class="p">The availability of molecular data allowed us to assign the Sardinian cultivars to genetic clusters and to analyze the associations between the identified clusters and the average agronomic and commercial performances. The Sardinian cultivars were clearly distinguished from USA cultivars but not from some commercial cultivars, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Picantili</italic> and the cultivars 
 <italic class="italic">Troito A</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Troito B</italic>. The separation of cultivars based on geographic origin has been already reported by Fernandez et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Based on a model-based Bayesian clustering approach, we assigned the analyzed Sardinian genotypes to two clusters which were differentiated for agronomic and commercial traits. The genotypes belonging to CL-A were early flowering and also showed a lower

 </inline-formula>-tocopherol content. Based on the combination of several traits, we indicate some Sardinian cultivars which, in our opinion, may have the potential for industrial processing. Specialized uses, such as the inclusion in chocolate bars, require small kernels. For example, two highly considered cultivars by the chocolate industry—the Spanish cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">Felisia</italic> and the American cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">Milow</italic>—have kernel weights of 0.85 and 0.82 g, respectively. The cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">Nuxedda</italic> showed a kernel weight of 0.84 g and a rancidity index of

 </inline-formula>, with oleic acid representing more than 75% of the total kernel oil. 
 <italic class="italic">Olla</italic> is another interesting cultivar, with 75.52% oleic acid and 15.61% linoleic acid. Both of these cultivars have low productivity but, due to their high oil quality, they deserve attention for specific uses or as parents for breeding programs. Noteworthy is that these two cultivars have similar scores along the first and second PCA axes which are correlated with the morphological and commercial quality of the kernels. Oblong-shaped kernels are highly desirable for sliced or slivered products, as more uniform slices can be obtained from oblong kernels. Several cultivars with long kernels, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Ciatta Inglese</italic> (

 </inline-formula> cm), showed high oleic to linoleic acid content ratios, thus associating a desirable kernel shape to high kernel oil quality. In agreement with other reports, we have shown that early flowering cultivars have, on average, reduced productivity. Among the possible causes subtending such a behavior, we underline the importance of frost damage during flowering. We identified some cultivars, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Basibi</italic>, that showed good kernel yields (0.93 kg/plant). These values are comparable to those observed for the reference cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">Ne Plus Ultra</italic> and lower than those for the reference cultivars 
 <italic class="italic">Genco</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Tuono</italic>. Noteworthy is that 
 <italic class="italic">Basibi</italic> flowered 14 days before 
 <italic class="italic">Non Pareil</italic> and 20 and 18 days before 
 <italic class="italic">Genco</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Tuono</italic>, respectively. Thus, these Sardinian genotypes may be considered of some interest for breeding programs employing early flowering germplasm or for extending almond cultivation in environments which allow short endodormancy periods [
