<p class="p">In conclusion, we report a local almond collection showing a high range of variability for several agronomical and commercial traits. Most of these genotypes were early blooming and showed exceptional properties in terms of kernel and oil quality. We propose that these genotypes should be taken into consideration as interesting resources for breeding programs or for extending almond cultivation to sites which are predicted to experience a rise of mean temperatures following the effects of global climate changes. Indeed, as reported by Prudencio et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], there is a risk in growing late-flowering cultivars in warm areas, since the chilling temperatures needed to break dormancy may not be reached, and this could affect dormancy breaking, as well as the quantity and quality of production.
