<p class="p">Kernel size and weight have been considered important targets in almond breeding. Efforts have been made to select genotypes with an average kernel size greater than 1 g. Notably, all but two Sardinian genotypes showed an average kernel weight heavier than 1 g. The cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">Bianca</italic> produced the heaviest kernels (1.84 g) and the cultivar
