<p class="p">High variability has been previously recorded also for individual oil components. Yada et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] reported that in commercial almond cultivars grown in various regions, oleic and linoleic content accounts for about 90% of the total lipids. Noteworthy is that all the Sardinian genotypes analyzed in this study showed a total content of oleic and linoleic acid higher than 90% of the total lipids. A high oleic acid content is desirable from both the quality and stability points of view, as it increases the nutritional value and the stability against rancidity [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The oleic acid content ranged from 68.64% in the cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">de Efisi Sinzoba</italic> up to 78.29% in the cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">De Mrasciai</italic>. Notably, the highest relative oleic acid content in the Kodad study was 78.4% for the 
 <italic class="italic">Yosemite</italic> kernels. The kernels of the Californian cultivar 
 <italic class="italic">Ne Plus Ultra</italic> showed 66.53% oleic acid content, the lowest value measured in this study.
