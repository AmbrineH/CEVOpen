<p class="p">Interest in the characterization of almond quality has recently increased following the demonstration that although the composition of almond oil depends primarily on the genotype, it is also defined by the environmental conditions prevalent during the growing season, location, and climate [

The identification of cultivars with particular qualitative characteristics, although with reduced productive potential, might also stimulate their cultivation for purposes such as cosmetic/pharmaceutical and characterization of typical foods.
