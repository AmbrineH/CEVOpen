<p class="p">Analysis of variance showed that both genotype and year significantly affected kernel oil composition (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00086-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The interaction cultivar by year was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for all oil components and also for the total oil content of kernels. The factor year explained more than cultivar and interaction for all oil components but not for total oil content, which was mainly accounted for by cultivar (see
