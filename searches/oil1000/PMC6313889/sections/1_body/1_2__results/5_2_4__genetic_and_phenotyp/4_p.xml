<p class="p">As the first step in assessing the relationships between the genetic and phenotypic diversity, we investigated the association between the collection partition based on the genetic data, and the morphological and chemical traits. The three Rebeccu cultivars were not considered for these analyses because they produce bitter kernels. Cluster CL-
