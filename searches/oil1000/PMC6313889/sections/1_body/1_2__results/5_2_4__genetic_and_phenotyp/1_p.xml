<p class="p">In a previous work, we demonstrated that based on the genotype at 11 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci, the Sardinian almond cultivars could be distinguished from most cultivars from Apulia but not from USA reference cultivars [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-07-00086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Here, we deepened the analysis on the relationship between the Sardinian and USA reference cultivars. Note that to gather a higher resolution, additional USA varieties and three bitter almond Sardinian cultivars were included in the analyses (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-07-00086" class="xref">Supplemental file S1</xref> for details on these cultivars). Model-based clustering of the SSR data identified two clusters as the most probable dataset partition [
