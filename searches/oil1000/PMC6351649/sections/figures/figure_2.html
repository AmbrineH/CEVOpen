 <p> Illustrations of ‘self-lubrication’ and the corresponding confocal photographs. Color indications under a confocal microscope: yellow, oil; blue, water/ethanol; black, clusters of nanoparticles; red, substrate. a Initial state of evaporating drops of ouzo solution with well-dispersed nanoparticles. High nanoparticle concentration causes the black appearance of the drop under confocal. b Prevention of nanoparticle deposition at the contact line. Triggered by evaporation, the ouzo effect occurs, resulting in the formation of an oil ring (yellow), which prevents pinned contact lines and equips colloidal drops with high mobility and low hysteresis. Meanwhile, nanoparticles aggregate and oil microdroplets nucleate on them. c The shrinkage of the oil ring. The oil ring sweeps nanoparticles/clusters from the substrate. After the evaporation of ethanol and water, the generated supraparticles either float on the residual oil, as illustrated in d, or sit on the substrate, as illustrated in  e, depending on the volume relationship between the supraparticle and the remaining oil. All the confocal photographs are from a horizontal scanning just above the substrate </p>
