 <p> Supraparticles self-assembly through drying ouzo suspensions drops on hydrophobic surfaces. a Snapshots of the evaporation of a sessile drop of ouzo suspensions (water, ethanol, anethole oil, and nanoparticles). The contact diameter of the drop on surface smoothly decreased during the whole process because of the formation of an oil ring at the contact line (pointed at by arrows), and ultimately a supraparticle emerged (see below). The time t is non-dimensionalized by the depletion time t D . b The first control experiment by evaporating a sessile drop of water-ethanol suspensions with the same water-ethanol-nanoparticle proportion (without oil). The decrease of the contact diameter stopped soon and no supraparticle formed in the end. c The second control experiment by evaporating an ouzo drop with the same water-ethanol-anethole proportion (without nanoparticles), which displays the same dynamical evolution as in experiment a. The oil ring formed at the contact line of the drop is pointed at by an arrow. d A schematic illustration of the variation of contact diameter. In experiments a and  c with the addition of the little anethole oil, the drops achieve a much smaller final contact diameter (red line) than in experiment b (blue line), which we call self-lubrication. e SEM photographs of the generated supraparticle from experiment a. f A close-up of the supraparticle. Scale bars in a– c are 250 μm </p>
