  <p class="p">Supraparticles self-assembly through drying ouzo suspensions drops on hydrophobic surfaces. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Snapshots of the evaporation of a sessile drop of ouzo suspensions (water, ethanol, anethole oil, and nanoparticles). The contact diameter of the drop on surface smoothly decreased during the whole process because of the formation of an oil ring at the contact line (pointed at by arrows), and ultimately a supraparticle emerged (see below). The time 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic> is non-dimensionalized by the depletion time

   </sub>. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> The first control experiment by evaporating a sessile drop of water-ethanol suspensions with the same water-ethanol-nanoparticle proportion (without oil). The decrease of the contact diameter stopped soon and no supraparticle formed in the end. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> The second control experiment by evaporating an ouzo drop with the same water-ethanol-anethole proportion (without nanoparticles), which displays the same dynamical evolution as in experiment 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>. The oil ring formed at the contact line of the drop is pointed at by an arrow. 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> A schematic illustration of the variation of contact diameter. In experiments 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> with the addition of the little anethole oil, the drops achieve a much smaller final contact diameter (red line) than in experiment 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> (blue line), which we call self-lubrication. 
   <bold class="bold">e</bold> SEM photographs of the generated supraparticle from experiment 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>. 
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> A close-up of the supraparticle. Scale bars in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> are 250 μm
