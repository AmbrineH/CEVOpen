 <p> Supraparticles with tunable shapes and high porosity. a Parameter space showing the initial oil volume fraction χ oil and nanoparticles volume fraction χ NP of colloidal drops in different cases (white square dots) with a same ethanol-to-water ratio (3:2). The calculated critical oil-to-nanoparticle ratio, k * = 110.7 (solid red line), divides the space into high ( k &gt;  k *) and low ( k &lt;  k *) oil-to-nanoparticle ratio regions. The generated supraparticles have a ball-like shape in the white region ( k &gt;  k *), while a more flat, oblate shape (see below) in the green region ( k &lt;  k *). b Both the dimensionless height  δh and depth  δl of the dented part of non-ball-like supraparticles are proportional to the oil-to-nanoparticle ratio in the green region. c The calculated porosity ϕ of supraparticles ranges from 78 to 92%. On increase of the oil-to-nanoparticle ratio, the diverse shapes are from a spherical-cap shape (profile photograph d), to a mushroom-like one e, f, and to a cupcake-like one g. Above the critical ratio  k * , a ball-like supraparticle is achievable (SEM image h). i Cross-section of the same supraparticle in h obtained by a FIB cutting illustrates the highly porous structure inside (Supplementary Movie  4). j– l A sequence of 3 zooms into the inner structure. The horizontal white dotted lines in d– g indicate the substrate position. The shadows below the lines are reflections. The image e shows the definitions of δl, l, δh, h. The error bars of the dimension and porosity of supraparticles represent the uncertainty in image processing. The error bars of the volume fraction of oil and nanoparticles represent the uncertainty from the preparation of the solution. The temperature and relative humidity during experiments were 20–23 °C and 35–50%, respectively </p>
