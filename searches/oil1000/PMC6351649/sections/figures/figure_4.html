 <p> Scalability of the process with different and multiple types of nanoparticles. a Demonstration of the flexible and handy scalability of supraparticle fabrication on OTMS/OTS surface. As self-lubrication and the robust surfaces allow for a simple harvesting process and to recycle the surfaces. b– h SEM images of the generated supraparticles. b A large quantity of generated porous TiO 2 supraparticles. c A close-up view of the porous surface of the particle in b. d Bunches of porous supraparticles made by TiO 2 (0.05 vol%) and SiO 2 (0.05 vol%) nanoparticles. e A close-up of the side of the particle in d. f Bunches of porous supraparticles with three different nanoparticles, TiO 2 (0.06 vol%), SiO 2 (0.03 vol%), and Fe 3O 4 (0.01 vol%). g, h present a sequence of two zooms into the particle in f. In h, the supraparticle surface was imaged with energy-selective backscatter (EsB) detector to present different materials in different grey levels: Fe 3O 4 (bright spots pointed by the yellow arrow), TiO 2 (light grey regions by the blue arrow), SiO 2 (dark grey regions by the red arrow). Darkness indicates holes without nanoparticles </p>
