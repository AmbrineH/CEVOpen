<p id="Par6" class="p">In this paper, we propose a reliable, robust and cost-efficient method for supraparticle fabrication by employing a ternary liquid with appropriately chosen mutual solubilities (ouzo solution) in evaporation-driven nanoparticle assembly, which enables us to produce highly porous supraparticles with tunable shapes on commonly used hydrophobic surfaces.</p>
