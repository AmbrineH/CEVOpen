<p id="Par4" class="p">However, the strong adhesion between colloidal dispersion drops and surfaces hinders this promising technique. Evaporating colloidal drops normally suffer from a pinned contact line. As a consequence, capillary flows inside the drop arise and carry the colloidal particles to the edge of the drop, leading to a ring deposition, i.e., the so-called coffee ring effect

 </sup>. Up to now, a feasible way to minimize the impact of the coffee ring effect on supraparticle synthesis is employing super liquid-repellant surfaces, where the colloidal drops can have a reduced initial contact area

 </sup>. These special surfaces, however, are high-cost and fragile. Besides, it is difficult to achieve a complete detachment of the synthesized supraparticles from the surfaces. Another potential method to overcome the pinning effect is by partially submerging the colloidal drops on a lubricated oil layer on the substrate or by using a lubricant-impregnate surface, but the mutual attractions of the floating drops due to the liquid surface deformation and the effect of gravity, i.e., the so-called cheerios effect, lower the controllability of this method
