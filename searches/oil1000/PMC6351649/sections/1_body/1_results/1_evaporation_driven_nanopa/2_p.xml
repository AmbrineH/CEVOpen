<p id="Par8" class="p">We perform a control experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) by evaporating a water-ethanol-nanoparticle drop (no oil contained, i.e., a binary liquid), with the same proportion of water, ethanol, and nanoparticle on the same substrate. In this case, no self-lubricating oil ring forms, and the nanoparticles deposites on the surface with various deposition patterns

 </sup>. In a second control experiment, we evaporate an ouzo drop without dispersed nanoparticles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). It has the same characteristics during evaporation as the case with all ingredients in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>. The comparison of these three cases demonstrates that the self-formed oil ring plays a crucial role in the reduction of the contact diameter (illustration Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>), which leads to the formation of a supraparticle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e, f</xref>). The oil ring lubricates the evaporating colloidal drop during the self-assembly of nanoparticles. Therefore we call this process self-lubrication.
