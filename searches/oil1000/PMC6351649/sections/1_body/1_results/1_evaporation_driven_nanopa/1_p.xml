<p id="Par7" class="p">The method is achieved by using the ternary liquid, here consisting of milli-Q water (39.75 vol%), ethanol (59.00 vol%), and a slight amount of trans-anethole (1.20 vol%) (ouzo solution), as the suspension medium of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles (0.05 vol%). We deposited a drop of 0.5 μL ouzo suspension on a hydrophobic trimethoxy(octadecyl)silane (OTMS)-glass surface. A camera recorded the drop evaporation from the side (Fig.
