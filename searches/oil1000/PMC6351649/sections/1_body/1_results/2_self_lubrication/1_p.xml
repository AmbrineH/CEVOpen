 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The formation of the oil ring was followed by conducting a series of horizontal scans ≈10 μm above the substrate. Perylene (for oil) and rhodamine 6G (for aqueous) were added into the solution to distinguish different phases: Blue, yellow, black, and red in the confocal images of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> represent the aqueous solution, the phase-separated oil, the nanoparticles (clusters), and the substrate, respectively. Initially, the colloidal ouzo drop was dark due to the dispersion of high concentration nanoparticles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). The blue color of the solution became visible once nanoparticles started aggregating (inset Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). The nucleated oil microdroplets attach to nanoparticles (clusters) due to the preference of heterogeneous nucleation on surfaces as compared to homogeneous nucleation in the bulk of liquids. Next, after the microdroplet nucleation, further nanoparticles will attach to the oil-aqueous interface

 </sup>. Meanwhile, the nucleated oil microdroplets on the surface coalesced into an oil ring at the drop edge, which prevented the nanoparticles (clusters) from accumulating at the air-oil-substrate contact line (red-yellow boundary line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Driven by evaporation, the colloidal drop contracted radially, and the oil ring was forced to slide inwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). The drop contraction leads to nanoparticles assembly into a three-dimensional structure. Here, surface tension prevails over gravity, as the small drops have small Bond number
