<p id="Par10" class="p">The shrinkage of the oil ring causes the levitation of the colloidal drop, and the final geometry of the supraparticle is sculpted. The ridge of the oil ring rounds the edge of the colloidal drop (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). The inner ridge of the oil ring acts as the lower half of the dynamical mold for the self-assembly of nanoparticles, while the liquid-air interface makes the upper half. Consequently, the developing supraparticle is shaped by the oil wetting ridge. Therefore, by adjusting the oil concentration in the mixture, which results into different sizes of the oil wetting ridge, we are able to obtain different configurations of the mold and thus the different morphologies of the generated supraparticles (illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d, e</xref>).
