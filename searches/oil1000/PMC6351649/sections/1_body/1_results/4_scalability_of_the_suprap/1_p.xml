<p id="Par17" class="p">An engineering benefit of this method is the ease of scalability of the supraparticle fabrication. To give a demonstration to this advantage, we built a setup in our laboratory (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>), which enables the automatic production of drops of similar size on trichloro(octadecyl)silane (OTS) or OTMS surfaces at rates of 20 drops per minute (Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). Few minutes after the drop being deposited, the supraparticles synthesis achieved. The supraparticle harvest was carried out by merely immersing the supraparticle-attached surface inside ethanol, and shaking them off with ease (Supplementary Movies 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). As a result, we had the supraparticles stored in liquid for future usage, and the surface was clean and ready for the next fabrication process. After several cycles, the supraparticle suspension was available. The self-lubricant layer and the complete detachment of the supraparticles increase the flexibility of supraparticle fabrication. Masses of supraparticles without controlled sizes could be fabricated through spraying the colloidal ouzo solution on the surface (Supplementary Movie
