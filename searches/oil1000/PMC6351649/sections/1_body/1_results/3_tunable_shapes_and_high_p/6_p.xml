<p id="Par16" class="p">The inner structure of the supraparticles verified the above explanation to the high porosity feature. To reveal this high porosity on all length scales in the interior of the supraparticle, we used the focused ion beam cutting technique (FIB) to investigate the supraparticle: Slide-by-slide cuts reveal the inner structure (Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3i</xref> displays an exemplary cross-section of the supraparticle. It presents a multi-scale, fractal-like interior structure, and clearly shows that around half of the particle volume is made with micron-size holes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3j</xref>). The rest contains many smaller holes of sub-micron size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3k</xref>). Nanoparticles are joint together forming nanoparticle branches and mesopores (nanometer size) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3l</xref>). These holes of (sub-) micron size originated from the nucleated oil microdroplets in the colloidal ouzo drop, as the nucleated oil microdroplets act as cells, being devoid of (clusters of) nanoparticles during the supraparticle development (Supplementary Movie
