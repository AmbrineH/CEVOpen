<p id="Par12" class="p">The experimental results reveal that the oil-to-nanoparticle ratio determines the supraparticle shapes. When the volume fraction of oil greatly exceeds the volume fraction of nanoparticles, a more spherical supraparticle forms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3h</xref>). For less oil, the supraparticles assume more flat, oblate shapes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d–g</xref>). Although the oil wetting ridge and the configuration of the water-air-oil contact region determine the supraparticle shape, the nanoparticle aggregation and rearrangement during the supraparticle development have an effect on the final shape of the supraparticle as well. Data points a, b (

 <sub class="sub">oil</sub> = 0), and c (
 <italic class="italic">χ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">NP</sub> = 0) represent the oil and nanoparticle concentrations in the three cases displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a–c</xref>, respectively. If the amount of separated oil is not enough to form a complete oil ring, the repeatability of the supraparticle generation is not good (four data points in the grey region of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>).
