<p id="Par15" class="p">The obtained very high porosity of 90% and beyond is another prominent feature of the supraparticles. We calculated this porosity based on the initial volume of the colloidal drops, with the known nanoparticle concentrations and the final size of the supraparticles. The calculated porosity data shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref> range from 77 to 92% and monotonically increase with the oil-to-nanoparticle ratio. The nucleated oil microdroplets existing in the bulk of liquids provide a significant contribution to the porosity. Due to capillary forces, nanoparticle network forms among the nucleated oil microdroplets

 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>. After all the liquids (also oil) have diffused out, as a consequence, empty cells are left behind, dramatically increasing the porosity of the generated supraparticles. Increasing the oil-to-nanoparticle ratio increases the volume of those empty cells, so the porosity of the supraparticles rises (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). The limitation of the porosity (92%) is that, during the contraction of the developing supraparticle, the oil microdroplets merge up gradually and parts of them are absorbed into the oil ring
