<p id="Par20" class="p">The purchased nanoparticles, titanium(IV) oxide (Aldrich, nanopowder, 21 nm, ≥99.5%), silicon dioxide (Aldrich, nanopowder, 10–20 nm, ≥99.5%), iron(II,III) oxide (Aldrich, nanopowder, 50–100 nm, 97%) were burned at 400 °C for 1 h to remove surfactants or contaminants attached on the particles before use. After that, the cleaned particles were added to specific amounts of Milli-Q water (produced by a Reference A+ system (Merck Millipore) at 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C) to make nanoparticle suspensions. Trans-anethole oil (Aldrich, 99%) and ethanol (Boom BV, 100% (v/v), technical grade) were used as received. Ethanol-oil (anethole) solutions were prepared separately beforehand and then mixed with the nanoparticle suspensions to make the final colloidal ouzo solutions with the required compositions for the experiments. We performed each mixing step in an ultrasonic bath for around 20 min.</p>
