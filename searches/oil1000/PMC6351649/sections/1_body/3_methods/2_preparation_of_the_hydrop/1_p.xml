<p id="Par21" class="p">The chemicals used for the hydrophobic substrate preparation, trimethoxy(octadecyl)silane (Aldrich, 90%), toluene (Aldrich, 99.8%), tetrahydrofuran (Aldrich, ≥99.9%), and ethanol (Boom BV, 100% (v/v), technical grade) were used as received as well. In our experiments, the microscope glass slides (Thermo Scientific) were used as solid substrates for the octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) layer coating. We first carefully wiped the glass slides with ethanol wetted tissue for mechanically removing contaminants from the surfaces. Then the slides were successively sonicated in fresh acetone, ethanol, and Milli-Q water, each for 15 min, to remove organic contaminants from the surfaces. We repeated this step once and dried the slides by nitrogen flow. Then the slides were cleaned by plasma cleaner for 10 min. After that, the cleaned glass slides were immersed into the coating mixture of 1 vol% octadecyltrimethoxysilane and 99 vol% toluene for 3 h. After that, the coated slides were removed and then put into fresh toluene and tetrahydrofuran successively to dissolve the unlinked octadecyltrimethoxysilane above the surfaces. Finally, we dried the slides by nitrogen flow and put them in a clean Petri dish for temporary storage. The preparation of octadecylsilanes(OTS)-treated substrate follows the same process.</p>
