<p id="Par19" class="p">In conclusion, our new method of mass production of self-lubricating, self-assembled supraparticles is a dramatic improvement over evaporation-driven supraparticle self-assembly on super liquid-repellent surfaces and lubricant-impregnate surfaces. With our technique, commonly used planar hydrophobic surfaces are sufficient for the supraparticle fabrication, which improves flexibility, operability, and cost-efficiency of the fabrication. Besides that, the shapes of the generated supraparticle are tunable by varying the oil-to-nanoparticle ratio of colloidal solutions. Combing our method with piezoacoustic inkjet technology can dramatically scale-up fabrication, as there is no limitation on supraparticle collection. The generated highly porous supraparticles with multi-scale, fractal-like inner structures are suitable for many practical applications, such as catalysis, photonics, chromatography, environmental pollution management, and material science

 </sup>. The self-lubrication effect, in conjunction with the easy detachment of the three-dimensional particle aggregates after the evaporation of particle-laden drops, implies a potential application in surface self-cleaning as well. We also note that the nucleated oil microdroplets in the colloidal drop can act as a carrier phase for different purposes. Additionally, by controlling the composition and temperature of the ouzo solution, different morphological features of the nucleated oil microdroplets—size, number, distribution—are tuneable as well

 </sup>. Therefore, we expect more complex and exciting supraparticles created through this route.
