 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), P-aminophenol (PATP), sodium citrate, and Rhodamine-6G (R6G) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Furfural and transformer oil (Karamay 25#) were purchased from Chuan Dong chemical company of Chongqing, China. Transformer oil was used as a solvent to prepare the sample solution. In order to avoid the influence of the initial state of new oil on the experimental results, degassing and drying of the new oil were carried out before experimentation. Twenty-five milligrams of furfural were fully dissolved in 225 mL of transformer oil, and 100 mg/L standard sample solution was obtained. In order to prevent the change of mass fraction caused by the decomposition of furfural under visible light, the prepared solution was quickly sealed in a brown reagent bottle and stored in the dark. Furfural transformer oil solution of 100 mg/L could be diluted with new transformer oil proportionately to obtain furfural samples with different concentrations dissolved in the oil. The standard sample solution was diluted proportionately to obtain different concentration samples. Using the magnetron sputtering technique, a gold shell with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited on the silicon chip. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized using the sodium citrate reduction method according to Lee-Meisel [

The gold film was washed in water and ethanol solution for 20 min each, then immersed in PATP solution for a period of time, removed with tweezers, and washed repeatedly to remove the surface of the unbounded PATP molecules. The pretreated gold film was dried with nitrogen and soaked in silver sol for a certain time, then washed several times alternately with ethanol and deionized water and dried with nitrogen at room temperature for storage. All of the SERS experiments in this work were measured by a commercial Micro-Raman spectrometer (ANDOR, SR-5000i-C, Oxford, England), and 532 nm lasers were chosen to be the illuminating sources. The integral time of the spectrometer was set at 10 s, and the accumulated integral was 3 times. In addition, the 1200 L/mm grating and the 100-m slit width of the spectrometer were used to detect the sample. The morphology and sizes of the silver nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN Mira3 LMH, Brno, Czech Republic). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo-Fisher-Scientific ESCALAB250Xi, Shanghai, China) was used to analyze the chemical valence states of elements on the surfaces of the substrates.
