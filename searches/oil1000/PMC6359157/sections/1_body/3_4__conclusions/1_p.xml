<p class="p">In order to realize in situ detection of furfural dissolved in transformer oil, silver nanoparticles were self-assembled on the surface of gold film with P-aminophenylthiophenol (PATP) as a coupling agent. R6G was used as the probe molecule to test the enhancement effect. In the process of preparing enhanced substrates, the effects of PATP concentration, deposition time in PATP, and immersion time in silver sol on the reinforcing properties of substrates were studied. By optimizing the molecular concentration, molecular deposition time, and silver sol deposition time of PATP, the nanoparticles were made more uniform and compact, and an enhanced substrate with rich hot spots was obtained. The optimum substrate was developed, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy detection of trace furfural dissolved in transformer oil was realized. The results showed that the substrate prepared under the conditions of 0.1 mol/L PATP, 5 h deposition in PATP, and 12 h immersion in silver sol had the best reinforcement effect, which was uniform and compact particle arrangement and no particle clusters. By use of this substrate, the minimum detectable concentration of furfural in transformer oil was about 1.06 mg/L, which provides a new method for fast and nondestructive detection of transformer aging diagnosis.</p>
