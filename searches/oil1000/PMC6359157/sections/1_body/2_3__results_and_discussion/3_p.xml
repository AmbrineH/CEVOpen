<p class="p">As a kind of mineral insulating oil, transformer oil mainly consists of alkanes, cycloalkanes, and unsaturated hydrocarbons, so its Raman spectrum is more complicated and there is some fluorescence interference. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a, black lines represent part of the spectrum of transformer oil, and red lines represent the Raman spectra of the 100 mg/L furfural in transformer oil. The comparison results show that the Raman signal of furfural was completely submerged by transformer oil, and the reason was the complex composition of transformer oil. Furthermore, blue lines represent the SERS of 100 mg/L furfural concentration in transformer oil. This shows that the Raman signal of furfural could be enhanced effectively by a substrate. To further determine the Raman signal characteristic peaks of furfural on the substrate, the Raman spectra of pure furfural and substrate are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b. Preliminary comparisons show that the SERS spectra mainly came from the signal of the substrate itself, that is, the Raman peak of the PATP molecule. As shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the characteristic peaks of 1072, 1139, 1183, 1386, 1431, and 1570 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> belonged to the characteristic peaks of the coupling molecules of PATP. The reason was that PATP was used to connect silver nanoparticles with gold film, and it was affected by electromagnetic coupling and enhanced the Raman signal. Therefore, PATP molecules appeared as strong Raman signals in the spectrum. At the same time, we found that these Raman signals overlapped severely with the Raman spectrum peaks of furfural, which brought serious interference to furfural detection. The Raman spectra of 1229, 1272, 1570, and 1662 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were from furfural, which corresponded to 1224, 1281, 1569, and 1670 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of pure furfural. This meant that the self-assembled surface-enhanced substrates on the gold film could effectively enhance the Raman signal of dissolved furfural in transformer oil, and the Raman wave number shift appeared in these four Raman spectra peaks. This was because the Raman vibration of furfural was affected by the molecule of transformer oil and the surface-enhanced substrate. In addition, the Raman-shift of these four Raman peaks was different, mainly due to physical enhancement and chemical enhancement, so the enhanced substrate had different effects toward the molecule in various modes of vibration. Among these furfural-enhanced Raman signals, the Raman peaks at 1662 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were enhanced, which may have been due to the fact that furfural molecules adsorbed mainly on the surface of silver nanoparticles through oxygen atoms, and the Raman peaks at 1662cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were related to the vibration of oxygen atoms. Therefore, it could be preliminarily determined that furfural existed in transformer oil.
