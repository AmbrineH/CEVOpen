<p class="p">In this paper, the internal standard method was used for quantitative analysis. In SERS spectra of the sample solution, the furfural peak at 1662 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was taken as a quantitative peak, and the substrate peak at 1469 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was taken as the internal reference peak. The calibration curve equation was established by the least square fitting method, and then the substrate concentration to be measured was calculated on the basis of the ratio of the Raman peaks area. Selecting the Raman peak of substrate as the internal peak could not only avoid errors in quantitative analysis, but could reduce the interference of adding materials. After removing the baseline with baseline correction, a Savitzky–Golay polynomial was used to smooth out the noise, as shown in

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> reduced with the decrease in furfural concentration. By using the least square method, linear regression was performed on the ratio of the furfural characteristic peak area at 1662 cm

It is seen from the graph that there was a good linear relationship between the ratio of the Raman peak area and the concentration of furfural in the range of measured concentration, and the goodness of fit was 0.98. The linear regression equation was:
