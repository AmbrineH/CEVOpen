<p class="p">Using a magnetron sputtering technique, a gold shell with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited on a silicon chip, and then PATP molecules with special functional groups were modified on the metal membrane. Finally, the prepared silver nanoparticles were deposited on the surface in order to obtain the SERS-enhanced substrate of the sandwich structure. A schematic diagram of the specific process is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a. The main reason for choosing gold film as a substrate was to format a dense PATP molecular membrane on the surface. Sulfhydryl compounds and gold films can be well bonded to form S-Ag bonds. Silver nanoparticles rely on N-Ag bonds formed by adsorbed PATP functional groups, which can avoid an agglomeration effect. It was necessary to observe the deposition of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the gold film by scanning electron microscopy, considering the uneven distribution of common deposition methods. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b, the gold film was basically covered by silver nanoparticles, which was very important for testing data stability. Due to the gold film being covered with silver nanoparticles, this indicated that adsorption of PATP molecules effectively avoided the aggregation of silver nanoparticles. It was beneficial to enhance the uniformity of the distribution of hot spots, which was particularly an important point for later experimental tests. In addition, the size and the shape of the particles had a great influence on the enhancement of the substrate. The preparation of silver nanoparticles was susceptible to the influence of temperature and external environment, which needed to be avoided as much as possible. By calculating the particle size distribution of silver nanoparticles in electron micrographs by using software (Nano Measure), it was found that the particle size was mainly concentrated in the range of 50–60 nm (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>c, black line (Au4d
 <sub class="sub">5/2</sub> and Au4d
 <sub class="sub">3/2</sub> represent the presence of gold)), the characteristic lines of elemental carbons (C1s) and nitrogens (N1s) appeared, which indicated that the PATP molecules had been effectively adsorbed on the surface of the gold films. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>d shows the N1s’ narrow spectrum of modified gold film. It is obvious that the characteristic peaks only appeared at 398.7 ev, which indicates that the amino groups on the PATP molecule did not react with the gold film. The reason was that new characteristic peaks appeared at 400.7 ev when the dehydrogenation of amino group occurred. This confirmed that the sulfhydryl group on the PATP molecule formed an Au-S bond with the gold film, while the amino group was far away from the gold film.
