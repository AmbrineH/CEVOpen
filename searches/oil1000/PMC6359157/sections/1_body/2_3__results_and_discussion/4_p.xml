<p class="p">It was necessary to know the characteristic Raman peaks of each substance and select the corresponding characteristic Raman peaks for the accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis of each substance. According to the selection principle of Raman characteristic peaks, the characteristic Raman peaks of selected substances should not overlap with the peaks of other components and should have high intensity, and should be within the detection range of a Raman spectrometer. The Raman peaks at 1570 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> overlapped with the base self-Raman signals. The Raman peaks at 1229, 1272, and 1662 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were relatively independent, but the intensity of the Raman peaks at 1662 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was higher. In order to obtain better detection sensitivity, 1662 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was selected as the characteristic peak of dissolved furfural molecule in transformer oil for further analysis. There overlapped between 1662 and 1570 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and Lorentzian fitting was used to separate the peaks. The goodness of fit was 0.9984, as shown in

When using the Raman spectroscopy technique to quantitatively analyze the sample solution, the concentration difference of the sample solution, the influence of solvent noise, laser intensity, and other factors interfere with the Raman signal. The absolute peak intensity of the Raman signal fluctuates with the measurement environment, so there is a big error in quantitative analysis this way. While the internal standard substance and the sample are under the same experimental conditions, it can effectively decrease some environmental factors to use the internal standard method for quantitative analysis of the Raman spectra.
