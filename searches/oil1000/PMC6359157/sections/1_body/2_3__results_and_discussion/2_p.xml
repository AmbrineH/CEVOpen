<p class="p">The enhancement effect mainly came from the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) produced by metal nanostructures under laser irradiation, and was mainly related to the metal material, morphology, substrate, particle size, and spacing. Previous studies have shown that the surface enhancement effects basically disappear when nanoparticle spacing is greater than 10 nm. Therefore, the substrate must satisfy the characteristics of high sensitivity and homogeneity, not only to meet the tight arrangement between particles, but also to avoid large area agglomeration effects. In the process of substrate preparation, PATP molecular concentration, molecular deposition time, and silver sol deposition time directly affect the final aggregation state of silver nanoparticles. Therefore, it was essential to further study the optimal experimental conditions. In

The distribution of silver nanoparticles on the substrate surface was more uniform and compact with increasing concentration. In order to evaluate the enhancement effect of the three substrates, the SERS properties of the substrates were tested for 1 × 10

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a. It is seen that the prepared substrate had an obvious enhancement effect on R6G. The SERS intensity of R6G on the substrate prepared at a PATP concentration of 0.1 mol/L was the strongest, which means that the substrate prepared at a PATP concentration of 0.1 mol/L had the highest SERS activity and the best enhancement effect, and these consequences were consistent with the above characterization results. This may have been due to the strong local electromagnetic field generated when the nanoparticles were close enough to form a “hot spot”, which greatly enhanced the Raman scattering signal of the probe molecules located at the “hot spot”. In addition, the deposition time of the substrate in the solution also affected the experimental results. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b gives the SEM of five substrates prepared in the deposited solution for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 h, respectively. The graphs show the silver nanoparticle coverage on the surface of the gold film increased and became more uniform, from 1 to 5 h. When the substrate was deposited in solution for more than 5 h, the coverage of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the gold film increased further, but the partially agglomerated particles appeared. R6G was used as a probe molecule to test the substrate properties in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b. The results showed that the substrate enhancement effect was the best when deposited for 5 h. This may have been because with the increase of deposition time in PATP ethanol solution, the coverage of particles on the substrate surface became higher and higher, and the spacing between particles decreased, forming a large number of “hot spots”. However, with the increase in deposition time, the agglomeration of metal nanoparticles occurred, which led to a decrease in the reinforcement effect. The immersion of the substrate in solution was of great significance due to the diffusion, collision, adsorption, and binding process of silver nanoparticles under various forces. Under the action of gravity and thermodynamics, the metal particles diffused and collided, and reacted with the gold film by the adsorption of amino groups near the substrate. Thus, it was particularly important to select the best soaking time. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00017-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d shows SEM images of six substrates prepared in silver sol for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h, respectively. It is seen from the graph that the coverage of particles on the substrate surface under 4 h of deposition time was small, while the spacing of particles was large, so it could have been difficult to form an effective “hot spot”. With the increase of the soaking time of the substrate in silver sol, the coverage of particles on the substrate surface increased and the spacing of particles decreased, so the number of “hot spots” increased. However, as the soaking time became longer, the coverage of particles on the surface increased slowly. The main reason was that the surface coverage of particles increased as time went by during the initial adsorption. However, after a period of time, the surface coverage of the particles was almost saturated due to electrostatic repulsion between particles, so it could not be increased if the depositing time was too long. In addition, the results indicated that the enhancement effect of substrate on R6G increased with time added at a range from 4 to 12 h, but the enhancement effect was no longer obvious after 12 h. This may have been because the coverage of particles on the substrate surface was getting higher and higher, and the “hot spot” was getting richer, so the reinforcement effect on R6G was getting better and better. After 12 h of deposition, the coverage of particles on the surface was close to saturation, and the enhancement effect was barely changed. Hence, silver nanoparticles ought to have been uniformly and tightly arranged on the surface-enhanced substrate prepared by immersing in silver sol for 12 h, which had a good reinforcing effect and shortened the experimental period. According to the analysis based on the above experimental results, it could be found that there was a direct relationship between the coverage of silver nanoparticles on the substrate surface and the enhancement effect of the substrate. The aggregation state of silver nanoparticles on the substrate surface could be changed by changing the self-assembly parameters (e.g., PATP concentration, deposition time in PATP, immersion time in silver sol), and different SERS substrates with different enhanced effects could be prepared. The substrate with the best enhancement effect could be prepared by use of this method, which needs no special equipment, is simple to operate, has a low cost, and can be used to control the morphology of the substrate by various means. In subsequent experiments, we prepared the gold film as substrate for surface-enhanced Raman analysis of trace characteristics dissolved in transformer oil, under the conditions of 0.1 mol/L PATP concentration, 5 h deposition in PATP, and 12 h immersion in silver gel (More details of the substrate were included in the
