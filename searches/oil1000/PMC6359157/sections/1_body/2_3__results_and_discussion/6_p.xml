<p class="p">The furfural concentration in transformer oil could be obtained using this equation. Therefore, the minimum concentration of dissolved furfural in transformer oil was about 1.06 mg/L according to the established detection method. After the concentration of furfural was determined, the degree of polymerization of insulating paper in transformer according to the following formula could be calculated, so the aging state of a transformer could be determined according to the following (
