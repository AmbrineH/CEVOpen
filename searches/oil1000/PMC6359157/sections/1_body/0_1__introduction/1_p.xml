<p class="p">Power transformers are indispensable equipment in a power system. Transformer failures occurring during service cause heavy economic losses and serious casualties to power suppliers. Therefore, regular diagnosis of transformer health is of great importance, especially for aging transformers [

 <xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The effects of temperature, electric field, water, and oxygen on the long-term operation of a transformer results in the breakdown of cellulose chains in insulating paper and produces furan derivatives dissolved in transformer oil [
 <xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. It is generally believed that glucose monomers that break the ends of cellulose chains are unstable and easy to break away from cellulose chains in the process of cellulose degradation. The disintegrated glucose monomers are easily decomposed by heating, causing five furan compounds including furfural, acetyl-furan, methyl furfural, furaldehyde, and 2,5-hydroxyl-methyl-furan formaldehyde. Among them, the content of furfural is the highest [

 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Thus, it is one of the most commonly used indexes to evaluate the insulation aging of oil paper. The aging of insulating oil does not produce furfural, which is produced only by the breakage of cellulose chains in the aging process of insulating paper. Furfural in oil is determined by insulating paper. Therefore, furfural in oil exclusively reflects the aging degree of insulating paper [
 <xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. This is a great advantage (furfural analysis in oil) in evaluating the aging of insulating paper. In addition, some study results have shown that furfural production is directly related to the aging of insulating paper under normal or overheated conditions compared to four other furan compounds, so furfural content could target the characteristics of the aging of insulating paper [
 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,

 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. At the same time, another advantage of furfural detection is easy to measure. According to field transformer data, the content of furfural in oil is usually much higher than four other furan compounds, which makes it easy to accurately detect. In 1996, the content of furfural was considered to be one of the necessary testing items in document DL/T596â€”1996. It pointed out that the aging level of a transformer is in the middle stage of life when the concentration of furfural dissolved in oil reaches 0.5 mg/L, and the aging level of the transformer is in late life when the concentration of dissolved furfural in the oil reaches 4 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Therefore, the analysis of the dissolved furfural content in transformer oil is of great significance to the correct evaluation of the aging state of a transformer. At present, the detection methods of furfural content in oil mainly include spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography [
 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. These detection techniques have high detection accuracy, but they all need to extract transformer oil samples and other pretreatment. They require high requirements for operators and the detection environment, complex operation processes, and long detection cycles, which can only be completed in laboratory operations. A new detection method is an urgent need for in-site and rapid detection of dissolved furfural concentration in transformer oil. Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic method used to detect the vibration of molecules. The main principle of Raman spectroscopy is inelastic scattering of light irradiated on matter. In inelastic collisions, energy exchange occurs between photons and molecules. Photons not only change the direction of motion, but also transfer part of the energy to molecules. The vibrational energy of a molecule is transmitted to the photon, changing the frequency of the photon. This scattering process is called Raman scattering. Raman spectroscopy, as a single wavelength laser detection technology, has the advantages of no sample pretreatment, no loss of samples, and fast detection speed [

 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In 2015, Somekawa et al. measured the content of dissolved furfural in oil by laser Raman spectroscopy, and realized the measurement of furfural with a minimum detection concentration of 14.4 mg/L in oil [
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In 2016, Gu et al. realized the detection of furfural in 0.1 mg/L by using confocal Raman technology and extraction technology, and achieved a maximum detection error of not more than 12.04% [
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, it is difficult to detect the low concentration of small molecules due to smaller molecular cross-sections. Fleischmann et al. found that pyridine molecules adsorbed on roughened Ag electrodes exhibited a large Raman scattering phenomenon [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In addition, the selective adsorption molecules on the active carrier surface inhibit the fluorescence emission, which greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio of laser Raman spectroscopy. This surface enhancement effect is called surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The SERS mechanism mainly includes electromagnetic field enhancement and chemical enhancement, in which electromagnetic field enhancement is dominant. This enhancement is produced by a surface plasmon resonance effect (that is, free electrons in metals have a collective oscillation effect under the action of optical and electrical fields [

 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In addition, a large number of new methods for fabricating enhanced substrates have been studied. Sergio et al. prepared uniform gold nano-octahedron structures combined with the use of a microfluidic technique based on micro-evaporation [
 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Jeong et al. prepared silver nanoshells with magnetic and SERS properties, which have been used to detect trace amounts of organic molecules [
 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-00017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is pretty meaningful to apply SERS technology to the detection of furfural in transformer oil.
