<p class="p">In this paper, the effects of P-aminophenylthiophenol (PATP) concentration, deposition time in PATP, and immersion time in silver sol on the reinforcing properties of substrates were studied. The surface morphology of the substrate was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Rhodamine-6G (R6G) was used as the probe molecule to test the enhancement effect. By optimizing the PATP molecular concentration, PATP molecular deposition time, and silver sol deposition time, the nanoparticles were more uniform and compact, and an enhanced substrate with rich hot spots was obtained. The low concentration and in situ detection of dissolved furfural in transformer oil were realized, which provides a new method for fast and nondestructive detection of transformer aging diagnosis.</p>
