<p class="p">An important discovery in our study is that MOL‐fed groups had lower sperm abnormality rates than the control group. Sperm abnormalities have long been associated with male infertility and sterility in most species (Saacke, 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Up to date, there is little published data concerning the effect of MOL on sperm abnormalities in animals. Cajuday and Pocsidio (
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) reported that male mice administered with the hexane extract of MOL showed increased spermatids in their seminiferous tubules by testicular histology. Additionally, 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf extracts could ameliorate electromagnetic radiation or cyclophosphamide induced sperm damage in rat and mice (Bin‐Meferij &amp; El‐Kott, 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Nayak, Vadinkar, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The exact mechanism for the decrease in the frequency of abnormal sperm is not clear. It was suggested that lower sperm abnormality resulted from lower chromosome abnormality and less minor alterations in testicular DNA and point mutation.
