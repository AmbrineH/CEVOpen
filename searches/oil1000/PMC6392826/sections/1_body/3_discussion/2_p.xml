<p class="p">In this study, MOL was adopted for the first time to identify the effect on long‐term (six consecutive gestations) reproductive performance of mice. Our results indicated that dietary MOL was able to improve litter size, litter birth weight, and litter survival. Litter size and litter survival are important indicators for reproduction performance (Rothschild,

 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) showed that rabbits receiving 100% Moringa diet had higher litter size, litter weight at birth and litter weight at weaning than those receiving 100% Centrosema. Additionally, it was also reported that in combination with hormone supplementation, MOL improved the rate of maturation of sheep oocytes and could act as a promoter to induce mRNA expressions and synthesis of essential proteins for the maturational processes (Barakat et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). They concluded that improvement of fertility by MOL administration might be due to its chemical compositions in the leaves as an excellent source of nutrients. Moreover, MOL contains beta‐carotene and other strong antioxidative phytochemicals (kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, and caffeoylquinic acids), essential antioxidative micronutrients (selenium and zinc as explained) and antioxidative vitamins (C, E, and A), that have regulative effects in fertility performance (Jaiswal, Rai, Kumar, Mehta, &amp; Watal,

 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In agreement with the above findings, the current study showed an improvement in reproduction performance of mice fed with MOL diet. Moreover, mice fed with 8% MOL diet did not work as well as the mice fed with 4% MOL. A possible reason is that 8% MOL feed contain higher alkaloids.
