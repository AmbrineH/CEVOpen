<p class="p">It is well known that mouse reproduction is regulated by a few crucial genes. AR and ERβ are essential for normal fertility efficiency of mice (Krege et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Shiina et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Pgk2 and Prm2 are crucial for maintaining the sperm motility, sperm chromatin integrity, and male fertility (Cho et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Danshina et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In the present study, the gene expressions of AR, Pgk2, and Prm2 in testis and ERβ in ovary seemed unchanged after feeding dietary MOL. The possible reason for this result is that all group mice are under normal and health condition and maintained normal physiological status while the functions of these key genes are to maintain normal reproduction processes. This result also demonstrated that MOL had no harmful effect on animal reproduction physiology. We also determined the expressions of Bcl‐2 and Bax, which are related to cell apoptosis. Interestingly, dietary MOL decreased the expression of Bax in testis tissue, proved both by qRT‐PCR and Western blot. A previous study demonstrated Bcl‐2 protein was an inhibitor of apoptosis, while Bax was an accelerator (Misao et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). The pre‐set ratio of Bcl‐2/Bax seemed to determine the survival or death of cells following an apoptotic stimulus (Albamonte et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Our results suggested that MOL may suppress testis cell apoptosis by down‐regulating Bax expression. Meanwhile, it has been reported that Bcl‐2/Bax was closely connected with antioxidative pathway (Yang, Wang, Xie, Sun, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Therefore, the antioxidative phytochemicals in MOL may change the expression of Bax. However, the exact mechanism has not been explored yet.
