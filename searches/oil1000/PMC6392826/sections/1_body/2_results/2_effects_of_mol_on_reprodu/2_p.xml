<p class="p">We measured the reproductive performance of mice for six consecutive gestations, and found that average birth weight, litter wean weight, and average wean weight were not significantly different among the control and MOL groups (

We measured body weight and organ weight of male mice and pregnant female mice, and results showed that MOL had no significant effects on body weight or organ coefficients (
