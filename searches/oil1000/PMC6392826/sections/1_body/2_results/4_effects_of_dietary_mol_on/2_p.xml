<p class="p">The sperm abnormality rate of male mice was also determined to examine the effect of MOL on semen quality. The microscopic observation of sperm morphology is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A–C. Interestingly, MOL‐fed groups had lower sperm abnormality rate than control group (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>D). These observations demonstrated that MOL could improve semen quality of mice. We determined the expressions of genes related to spermatogenesis in testis tissue. The expression levels of androgen receptor (AR), phosphoglycerate kinase2 (Pgk2), protamine2 (Prm2), and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) in testis remained unchanged after feeding dietary MOL (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>E–G). Importantly, Bcl2‐associated X protein (Bax) was reduced in the MOL groups male mice relative to the control group (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>I), which was further confirmed by Western blot (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3918-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>A,B). These results indicated that MOL may boost mice reproduction by improving sperm quality and inhibiting testicular apoptosis.
