<p class="p">Mice sperm abnormality test was performed as described by Wyrobek and Bruce (
 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1975</xref>). Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and their cauda epididymides were removed. Two sperm suspensions were prepared, each from two cauda epididymides by mincing in 2 ml of phosphate buffered physiological saline, pipetting the resulting suspension and filtering it through an 80‐μm synthetic fiber mesh bag to remove tissue fragments. A fraction (30 μl) of each suspension was then pipetted and smeared at a load fragment to be allowed to dry at room temperature. Then, the load fragments were soaked in methyl alcohol for 5 min for fixation, and stained with 1% Eosin Y, and 60 min later, washed with water. The stained samples were again dried at room temperature. For each suspension, 500 sperms were examined at 400‐fold magnifications; a total of 1,000 sperms were thus examined for each mouse. Abnormal sperms include those with no hook, no head, vacuolar head, amorphous, tail fold, double heads, double tails, etc.
