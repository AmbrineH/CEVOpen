<p class="p">Litter size, litter birth weight, average birth weight, litter survival until weaning age (21 days), litter wean weight, and average wean weight were recorded for each pair of mated mice. After the seventh successful pregnancy of female mice, all male mice were sacrificed for the examination of sperm abnormality rate, blood samples, and testis tissues. For female mice, in order to exclude the effect of estrus cycle on the experiment, female mice were sacrificed to collect blood samples and ovary tissue on the 14th day after pregnancy. Observable pessus was regarded as a successful pregnancy (Liu et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3918-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Pessus is a white mixture of male seminal vesicle secretion and female vaginal secretion after mating in mice. Generally, it is formed at the vaginal orifice of female mice within 2–4 hr after mating, and can remain at the vaginal orifice for 12–24 hr. Testis or ovary tissues were quick‐frozen by liquid nitrogen. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1,000 ×
