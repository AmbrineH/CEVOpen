<p class="p">Thirty male and 30 female NIH Swiss mice at 4 weeks of age were obtained from the Animal Experiment Center of Guangdong Province (permission number: SYXK [Yue] 2016‐0136). The mice were acclimated for 3 days before the experimental period and maintained under a photoperiod of 12/12 hr (day/night) at a temperature of 24°C ± 2°C and relative humidity of 60% ± 10% throughout the experimental period. The mice had free access to food and drinking water. The mice were randomly assigned to the control group (diet without MOL), 4% MOL group (diet supplemented with 4% MOL), or 8% MOL group (diet supplemented with 8% MOL). All the mice were fed with our experiment feed until sacrificed. At age of 60 days, mice (one female and one male) were mated in one mouse cage and reproduced for six consecutive gestations. MOL powder was purchased from Yunnan Province of China. The chemical compositions of the MOL powder are in Table
