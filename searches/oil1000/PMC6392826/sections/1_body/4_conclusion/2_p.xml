<p class="p">In summary, we have investigated the beneficial effects of MOL on animal reproduction. Our studies showed that dietary MOL improved reproductive performances of mice. Dietary MOL decreased serum MDA in both male and female mice, and more importantly, MOL reduced the rate of sperm abnormality in male, and the expression of Bax. Our findings provided a basis for the further understanding of MOL supplementation and animal reproduction. Further studies are necessary to search for the active constituents of MOL and its specific mechanisms.</p>
