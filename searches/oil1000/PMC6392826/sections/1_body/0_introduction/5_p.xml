<p class="p">However, there is little information on whether dietary MOL could improve reproductive performance in animals. Thus, in this study, we investigated the effects of dietary MOL powder on the reproductive parameters, serum hormones, serum antioxidant indicators, and expressions of essential genes in mice, thereby determining its role in animal reproduction. Not only could these results provide a series of significant data, but also enhance and enlighten the knowledge on development of MOL or its bioactive components in the field of animal reproduction.</p>
