  <p class="p">Inhibition percentage (IP) of local lesion number (LLN) on the half-leaves of 
   <italic class="italic">Chenopodium quinoa</italic> plants inoculated with 
   <italic class="italic">Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> containing associated satellite RNA (CMVsat). Prior to inoculation, the virus was incubated for a short time (0 h), 1 h, 2 h or 3 h with essential oil (EO) of 
   <italic class="italic">Micromeria croatica</italic> from the localities Bojinac (Boj), Bačić kuk (Bk) and Stupačinovo (St), β-caryophyllene (β-C) and caryophyllene oxide (CO). Control half-leaves were inoculated with virus inocula without EO or oil components. Ten to fifteen experimental plants (four leaves per plant) were inoculated in each group. Values are expressed as the mean value + SD calculated based on the three independent evaluations (n = 3). The asterisk (*) denotes significant inhibition of LLN compared to the control (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
