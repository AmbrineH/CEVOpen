  <p class="p">Relative expression of the alternative oxidase (
   <italic class="italic">Aox1a</italic>) gene in upper leaves of CMVsat infected 
   <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants determined with qRT-PCR. Plants were: uninoculated, buffer-treated (Mock); infected with 
   <italic class="italic">Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> containing associated satellite RNA (Virus infected); sprayed with essential oil (EO) of 
   <italic class="italic">Micromeria croatica</italic> from the localities Bojinac (Boj), Bačić kuk (Bk) and Stupačinovo (St) or with β-caryophyllene (β-C) and caryophyllene oxide (CO) three consecutive days prior to inoculation of the virus. Error bars represent standard deviation calculated from three biological replicates. Normalisation factors were calculated as the geometric mean of the expression levels of the reference genes (F-box and EF 1α). Uninoculated (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) or virus-infected (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) sample was used as the calibrator (=1). Leaves were harvested on the third day after inoculation. The asterisk (*) denotes a significant change in the expression of the 
   <italic class="italic">Aox1a</italic> compared to the control (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> ˂ 0.05).
