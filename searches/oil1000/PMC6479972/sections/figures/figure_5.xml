  <p class="p">Inhibition of CMVsat (satellite associated 
   <italic class="italic">Cucumber mosaic virus</italic>) concentration (Ic) in 
   <italic class="italic">Nicotiana megalosiphon</italic> plants following: Simultaneous inoculation (si) of virus inocula with essential oil (EO) of 
   <italic class="italic">Micromeria croatica</italic> from the localities Bojinac (Boj), Bačić kuk (Bk) and Stupačinovo (St) or with β-caryophyllene (β-C) and caryophyllene oxide (CO); treatment prior to inoculation (pt) with EO of 
   <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> from the localities Boj, Bk and St or with β-C and CO; continuous treatment (ct) prior and after inoculation with EO of 
   <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> from the localities Boj, Bk and St or with β-C and CO, all related to CMVsat concentration in control plants. All experimental groups consisted of about 50 plants. Leaves were harvested on days 1, 3, 4 and 7, post inoculation (p.i.). Values are expressed as the mean value ± SD calculated based on three independent experiments.
