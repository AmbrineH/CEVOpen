 <p> Inhibition percentage (IP) of local lesion number (LLN) on the leaves of Chenopodium quinoa plants inoculated with Cucumber mosaic virus containing associated satellite RNA (CMVsat). Prior to inoculation, plants were sprayed with essential oil (EO) of Micromeria croatica from the localities Bojinac (Boj), Bačić kuk (Bk) and Stupačinovo (St), β-caryophyllene (β-C) and caryophyllene oxide (CO) for 1, 2 or 3 consecutive days. Control plants were inoculated with virus inocula without EO or oil components. Ten to fifteen experimental plants (four leaves per plant) were inoculated in each group. Values are expressed as the mean value ± SD calculated based on three independent evaluations (n = 3). The asterisk (*) denotes significant inhibition of local lesions number compared to the control ( p &lt; 0.05). </p>
