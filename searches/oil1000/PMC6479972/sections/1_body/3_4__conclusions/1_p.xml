<p class="p">β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were the main oil components in investigated samples of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria croatica</italic> from the localities Bojinac, Bačić kuk and Stupačinovo (Mt. Velebit, Croatia). An antiphytoviral assay showed that simultaneous inoculation of CMVsat with essential oil or the dominant components of the oil, or treatment of plants with essential oil or the dominant components of the oil prior to virus inoculation resulted in a reduction of the number of lesions on the leaves of local host plants, and a reduction of the virus concentration in systemically infected plants. Antiviral activity of the essential oil was correlated with the antiviral activity of the main oil component, demonstrating the role of β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide in the activity of the essential oil in plant defence against viruses. At least one part of the defence response mediated by essential oil involves a change in the level of expression of the alternative oxidase (
