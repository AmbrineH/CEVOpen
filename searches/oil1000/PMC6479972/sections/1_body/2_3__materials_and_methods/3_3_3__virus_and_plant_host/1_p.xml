<p class="p">Cucumber mosaic virus with associated satellite RNA (CMVsat), previously described by Škorić et al. (1996) [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], was propagated in a systemic host, 
 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana megalosiphon</italic> Van Heurck &amp; Müll. Arg. A voucher specimen of this plant virus is deposited at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb. Systemically infected leaves were homogenised in phosphate buffer (0.06 mol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, pH 7.0), briefly centrifuged at 5.000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was used for inoculation. Prepared inoculum was diluted with the same buffer to give a suitable number (10–30) of discrete local lesions on test plants. Leaves of the host plants were dusted with silicon carbide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) prior to inoculation.
