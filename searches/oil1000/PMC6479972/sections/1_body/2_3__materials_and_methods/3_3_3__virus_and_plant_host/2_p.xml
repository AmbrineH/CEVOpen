<p class="p">Seeds of host plants 
 <italic class="italic">Chenopodium quinoa</italic> Willd and 
 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana megalosiphon</italic> were sown in trays in a growth chamber (RK-900, Kambič, Semič, Slovenia) at a temperature of 26 °C under a 16:8 h light/dark cycle, with watering as required. Seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh. ecotype Col-0 were stratified at 4 °C in the dark for two days prior to sowing and after sowing transferred to a growth chamber at a temperature of 23 °C under a 12-h photoperiod. Experimental plants were selected three to four weeks after sowing. Care was taken to ensure that the experimental plants were as uniform in size as possible.
