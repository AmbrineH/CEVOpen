 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants were divided into eight groups: uninoculated plants, plants rubbed with phosphate buffer, plants inoculated with virus inocula, and plants sprayed with distilled water containing separately EO Boj, EO Bk, EO St, β-caryophyllene or caryophyllene oxide, at a final concentration adjusted to 500 ppm, for three consecutive days prior to virus inoculation. Upper leaves harvested on day 3 post inoculation (day 0) comprised the upper rosette leaves, excluding flower stalks. Three biological replicates from all experimental groups were analysed for 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene expression. Each group consisted of about 30 plants that were harvested, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried for 24 h in the freeze dryer LIO-5P (Kambič, Semič, Slovenia). Freeze dried tissue was powdered with a mortar and pestle and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.
