 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic>1a) (Assay ID: At02278012_g1) was measured using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in an optical 96-well plate using a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The average CT values calculated from triplicate samples were used to determine the fold expression relative to the controls. Data were normalized to the expression level of
