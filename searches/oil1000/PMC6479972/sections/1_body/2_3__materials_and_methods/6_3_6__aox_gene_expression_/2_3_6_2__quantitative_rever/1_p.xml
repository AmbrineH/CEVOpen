<p class="p">Total RNA was purified from the collected plant material of 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> using TRI Reagent Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For Dnase treatment, 10 μg purified total RNA from each sample was used and processed with 2U TURBO Dnase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 10 μg total RNA treated with DNase was used for cDNA synthesis and was mixed with oligo d(T)16 and random hexamer primers, both in the final concentration of 0.1 μmol L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. To that mixture, dNTPs (2.5 mmol l
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were added, incubated for 10 min at room temperature and subsequently cooled on ice. For reverse transcription, a master mix (12 μL, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) containing 5 μL of 25 mmol l
