<p class="p">EO Boj, EO Bk, EO St, β-caryophyllene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and caryophyllene oxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were added separately to virus inocula at a final concentration adjusted to 500 ppm. Prepared inocula were incubated at room temperature for a short time (0 h), 1, 2 or 3 h. Inoculation on the half-leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">C. quinoa</italic> using a sterile glass spatula (0.1 mL amount per leaf half) followed. The corresponding opposite (control) half was rubbed with the control virus inocula to which distilled water was added instead of essential oil or oil compounds. Inoculated leaves were washed thoroughly with distilled water 1 min after inoculation. Ten to fifteen experimental plants (four leaves per plant) were inoculated in each experiment. Local lesions were counted by developing clear and well-visible symptoms (5–6 days after virus inoculation) and the inhibition percentage was calculated by comparing the number of viral lesions on the two leaf halves according to the formula: IP = [(C − T)/C] × 100, where IP = inhibition of local lesions in %, C = mean number of local lesions on the control leaf-half; T = mean number of local lesions on leaf-half inoculated with virus inocula containing essential oil, β-caryophyllene or caryophyllene oxide.
