<p class="p">The aboveground parts of several dozen randomly selected plants were harvested from plants on a dry day and mixed to obtain a randomly selected sample. Samples were air-dried for ten days in a well-ventilated room at 60% relative air humidity and room temperature (22 °C), single-layered and protected from direct sunlight. Dried aerial parts (100 g) from each locality were subjected to hydro-distillation for 3 h in a Clevenger type apparatus. Essential oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored at −20 °C for further experiments. The essential oils (EOs) were named according to abbreviation of the locality of collection (EO Boj, EO Bk, EO St). Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed on a gas chromatograph (model 3900; Varian Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), mass spectrometer (MS) (model 2100T; Varian Inc.), non-polar capillary column VF-5ms (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm) and polar CP Wax 52 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm; Varian Inc.). Chromatography conditions were as described by Kremer et al. (2012) [
