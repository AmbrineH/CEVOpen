 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana megalosiphon</italic> plants were: (i) inoculated with virus inocula in which EO Boj/EO Bk/EO St/β-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide were added at a final concentration adjusted to 500 ppm (simultaneous inoculation); (ii) three consecutive days prior to virus inoculation, plants were sprayed with distilled water in which EO Boj/EO Bk/EO St/β-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide were added at a final concentration adjusted to 500 ppm (pretreatment); and (iii) three consecutive days prior and seven consecutive days after virus inoculation, plants were sprayed with distilled water in which EO Boj/EO Bk/EO St/β-caryophyllene or caryophyllene oxide were added at a final concentration adjusted to 500 ppm (continuous treatment). The same number of control plants were rubbed with virus inocula (control for simultaneous inoculation) or were sprayed with distilled water and rubbed with virus inocula (control for pretreatment and continuous treatment). Uninfected plants were used as negative controls. All experimental groups consisted of about 50 plants. The virus was purified from young, uninoculated leaves of systemically infected plants collected at on days 1, 3, 4 and 7 post inoculation (day 0). Leaves were homogenized in chilled 0.01 M Na/K-phosphate buffer (1:1,

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and 0.05 M EDTA. Following clarification with ¼ volume chloroform-
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-butanol (1:1), the virus particles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (60,000 g, 140 min) and resuspended in 0.01 M homogenization-buffer without additives. The purity and concentration of the virus preparation was measured by a spectrophotometer (BECKMAN DU 530, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) according to the formula: C = (A

 <sub class="sub">260</sub> = absorption (λ = 260 nm), R = dilution.
