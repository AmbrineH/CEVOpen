<p class="p">The inhibition percentage was calculated by comparing the virus concentration in the essential oil-treated and control groups according to the formula: 
 <italic class="italic">Ic</italic> = [(
 <italic class="italic">Cc</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">Ct</italic>)/
 <italic class="italic">Cc</italic>] × 100, where 
 <italic class="italic">Ic</italic> = decrease of virus concentration in %, 
 <italic class="italic">Cc</italic> = virus concentration in the control group, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ct</italic> = virus concentration in the essential oil-treated group. The results are presented as the average from three repeated experiments.
