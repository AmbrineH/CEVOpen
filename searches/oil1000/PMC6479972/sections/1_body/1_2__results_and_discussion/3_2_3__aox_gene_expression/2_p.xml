<p class="p">The results presented here provide new insight into the antiphytoviral activity of essential oils. Understanding the defence response mechanisms at the molecular level will improve our understanding of the plant defence responses and enhance our knowledge about the antiphytovial potential of essential oils and their use in the prevention of viral plant diseases. The above presents several directions for future research that should aim to clarify the mechanism of antiviral activity of essential oils.</p>
