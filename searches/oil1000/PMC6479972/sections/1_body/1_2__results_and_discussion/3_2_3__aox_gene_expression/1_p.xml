<p class="p">In order to better elucidate the plant defence pathways against viruses at the molecular level, 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> was used as a plant that is a well-known model system susceptible to CMV infection. The aim was to study the effects of EO/DC of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> oil on the expression of one of the important genes in plant defence against pathogens. Changes in the expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene in different biotic and/or abiotic stress conditions, such as infection by a pathogen, suggests that AOX belongs to the proteins involved in defence against biotic and abiotic stress [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The enzyme AOX reduces the formation of new reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria and, under stress conditions, can prevent an increased accumulation of ROS molecules [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Our experimental results showed that virus infected plants increased 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> expression compared to healthy, untreated plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a). Literature reports show that plants exposed to stress conditions, biotic or abiotic, synthesise ROS molecules, and the virus defence response directs the flow of electrons to the enzyme AOX that acts as negative regulator of ROS synthesis [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Another study found that increased expression of 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> in the Arabidopsis plant is accompanied by an enhanced spread of the virus CMVsat throughout the plant and decreased expression with a slowing of the systemic spread of the virus [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. We found that plants treated with EO Boj/EO St/β-caryophyllene prior to virus inoculation decreased 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene expression compared to untreated infected plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b). In accordance with the literature data, it can be assumed that the EO treated plant, rather than the virus, silences the expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene, thereby protecting the plant by slowing the spread of CMVsat. Lower expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene and increased concentration of mitochondrial ROS molecules protects the plant through the appearance of induced resistance to CMV and a deceleration of the spread of the virus [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. On the contrary, plants treated with the both essential oil from the locality Bk and caryophyllene oxide showed increased 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene expression compared to untreated infected plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b). Another study found that AOX induction also occurs in response to other pathogen infections [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], and hence may be a general consequence of pathogen infection rather than a specific resistance response to the virus. These results lead to the conclusion that one part of defence response mediated by EO involves a change of expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene. This is consistent with Murphy et al. (2004), who suggested that the enzyme AOX could be a regulator of the ROS molecule mediated signalling in plant defence response to viruses [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The involvement of EO constituents in plant defence was also described by Hong et al. (2012), who examined the emission of volatile terpenes by 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic> flowers, which may function in plant–insect interactions [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The same authors state that 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> MYC2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, directly binds to promoters of the sesquiterpene synthase genes, TPS21 and TPS11, and activates their expression. Expression of TPS21 and TPS11 can be induced by the phytohormones GA and JA, and both inductions require MYC2. The induction of TPS21 and TPS11 results in increased emission of sesquiterpene, especially (E)-β-caryophyllene. These results indicate that the production of these sesquiterpenes is integrated with the GA and JA signalling pathways involved in plant defence [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Accordingly, it can be concluded that exogenously applied EOs and sesquiterpene constituents of the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> are involved in plant defence against CMVsat infection.
