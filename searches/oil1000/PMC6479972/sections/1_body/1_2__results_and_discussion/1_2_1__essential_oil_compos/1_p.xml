<p class="p">The EO of the endemic 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria croatica</italic> from Mt. Velebit, Croatia (localities Bojinac (Boj), Bačić kuk (Bk), and Stupačinovo (St)) was subjected to detailed GC and GC-MS analysis to determine chemical composition and the similarity and variability in oil composition depending on locality. The chemical composition of EOs, the percentage of identified components and their retention indices are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01342-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, where all the components are arranged in order of their elution from the VF-5ms capillary column [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The overall composition of EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> is characterized by a high percentage of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01342-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In the oil from Boj, sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene (25.2%) is the dominant component, followed by oxygenated sesquiterpene caryophyllene oxide (10.1%). In the oil from Bk, the cumulative amount of monoterpenes is substantially higher than sesquiterpenes, although the oxygenated sesquiterpene caryophyllene oxide (21.1%) is a major component of this oil. In the oil from St, caryophyllene oxide (20.2%) is the major compound, followed by β-caryophyllene (10.2%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01342-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Minor qualitative and quantitative differences in the annual oil composition at the localities Boj and Bk were observed in comparison to previous results presented by Kremer et al. (2012), though the major components in oil composition remained unchanged [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Namely, β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were also identified as the dominant components of oil at the described localities [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Due to their high content in the composition of oil, β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were also subjected to n antiphytoviral assay to investigate their role in antiviral activity of the oil. The composition of oil at the St locality (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01342-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) presents new data and consequently was not comparable to previous results at the annual level. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to provide an overview of the capacity to distinguish essential oil components based on GC-MS data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The common components of EO composition at the localities Boj, Bk and St clustered in the middle of the diagram. The EO components grouped at the periphery of the diagram show qualitative discrepancies in oil composition among the localities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Based on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the EO composition in the studied populations of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> can be considered to be quite uniform. A somewhat more pronounced degree of specificity was observed in the composition of oil from St (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Cluster analysis classifies the number of samples studied into groups according to the chemical composition of essential oil by ‘magnifying’ their similarities. Multivariate analysis of the samples differentiated two well-defined clusters of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), in which one cluster included the localities Boj and Bk, and the locality St was isolated in its own cluster, indicating the specificity of its EO composition.
