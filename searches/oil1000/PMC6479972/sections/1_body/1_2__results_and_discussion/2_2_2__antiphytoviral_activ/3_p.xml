<p class="p">Based on this promising antiviral activity of EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> in local host plants, several additional parameters were examined to further clarify its antiviral activity. According to our knowledge, the effect of EOs on virus replication in systemic host plant has not yet been tested. With the aim of determining whether the above treatments affect the spread of the virus in systemic host plants, virus concentrations were compared in upper, new-grown leaves of EO-treated and untreated 
 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana megalosiphon</italic> plants continuously over seven days post inoculation (p.i.). In that sense, systemic host plants were: 1. simultaneously inoculated with virus and EO/DC of oil; 2. treated with EO/DC three days prior to virus inoculation; or 3. continuously treated with EO/DC three days prior and seven days after virus inoculation. The virus concentration was determined in systemically infected upper leaves collected at 1, 3, 4 and 7 days p.i. to provide complete information on viral dynamics possible influenced by the EO.
