 <italic class="italic">M. croatica.</italic> Thus, the EO/DC of oil was rubbed onto leaves of local and systemic host plants simultaneously with virus inocula, or the EO/DC of oil were introduced into host plants prior to virus inoculation. The aim was to gain insight into the antiphytoviral activity of the oil by providing data on EO-plant-virus interactions using a variety of inoculation methods of local and systemic host plants. In simultaneous inoculation on the leaves of local host plants, the virus was incubated with EO/DC of oil for 0, 1, 2 and 3 h prior to inoculation. When inoculation was carried out after a short incubation period (0 h), EO Boj and β-caryophyllene were most effective in reducing the number of local lesions compared to the control (33.9% and 38.3%, respectively) (

EO St and caryophyllene oxide were most effective during the experiment with two-hour preincubation with the virus in comparison to the control (34.5% and 33.4%, respectively), while EO Bk was the most effective after one-hour preincubation (33.6%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Three-hour preincubation was statistically ineffective for reduction of local lesions in all experimental groups, with the exception of β-caryophyllene, which inhibited lesions by 25.3% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Based on these results, Pearson’s correlation coefficient established a positive correlation of the antiviral activity of EO Boj with β-caryophyllene. Antiviral activity of EO Bk and EO St positively correlated with the antiviral activity of caryophyllene oxide.
