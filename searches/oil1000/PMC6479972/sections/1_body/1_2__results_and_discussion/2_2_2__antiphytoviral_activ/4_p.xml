<p class="p">In simultaneous inoculation with the virus, both EO Boj and β-caryophyllene reduced virus concentrations on day 1 p.i. by 23.8% and 25.0%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Inhibition of virus concentration had a decreasing tendency in later stages of infection in all experimental groups in this experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). A positive correlation of the antiviral effect of EO Boj with β-caryophyllene was established by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Pretreatment with EO/DC of oil was more successful in reducing virus concentration than simultaneous inoculation in all experimental groups. Namely, EO Boj and β-caryophyllene reduced virus concentrations on day 1 p.i. by 26.3% and 21.8%, respectively, EO Bk and caryophyllene oxide were the most effective on day 4 p.i. with inhibition of 28.3% and 28.6%, respectively, while pretreatment with EO St reduced virus concentrations on day 3 p.i. by 25.0% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficient established a positive correlation of the antiviral activity of EO Bk with caryophyllene oxide. Continuous treatment of systemic host plants with EO/DC prior to and after inoculation did not improve the antiphytoviral effect over treatment prior to inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Based on the overall results of inhibition of viral infection by EO, it can be concluded that the antiphytoviral activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> EO in local host plants positively correlated with the activity of the main oil components. The observed discrepancies from this rule in the systemic host plants provide the answer to the question of whether antiviral activity is constant given the differences in oil composition. Since both the PCA and cluster analysis showed that composition of the oil from locality St was specific (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), it is possible that this slightly different oil composition affects its antiviral activity. It is possible that aside from the main components, other components in this oil or their synergistic effects contributed to the antiviral activity of oil from St. A similar conclusion was reported in previous studies [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and is supported here by new evidence involving multiple treatments and different hosts (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the effect of these treatments on virus concentrations in systemically infected plants supports the conclusion about the defence response as the mode of antiviral activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> EO. The results of the inhibition of CMVsat (satellite associated 
 <italic class="italic">Cucumber mosaic virus</italic>) infection in local and systemic host plants by EO/DC of oil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01342-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>) leads to the conclusion that the antiphytoviral effect is more affected by the method of EO application and the EO-virus-plant host combinations studied than by the described variations in the oil composition.
