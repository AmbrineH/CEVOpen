<p class="p">The next aim of this study was to determine whether different methods of EO/DC application affect antiviral activity in local host plants and whether EO/DC has the ability to activate the defensive response of local host plants against viruses. Thus, local host plants were treated with EO/DC for one, two and three consecutive days prior to virus inoculation. Although all pretreatments significantly reduced the number of local lesions, the strongest antiviral effect was manifested after three days of treatment in all experimental groups. Reduction of local lesion numbers ranged between 66.8% and 71.4% (

This part of the study led to the conclusion that simultaneous inoculation of virus inocula and EO/DC of oil is less effective for the reduction of local infection than treatment prior to inoculation (
