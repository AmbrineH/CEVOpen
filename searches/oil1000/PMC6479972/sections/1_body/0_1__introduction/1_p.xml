<p class="p">Essential oils (EOs) have become a subject of interest due to their numerous biological effects, attributed primarily to prooxidant effects at the cellular level [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Significant quantitative and qualitative variations of essential oil components have been observed within and between species, but also within populations and even within individuals, with strong implications for plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions. The defensive action of essential oils can be direct, through toxicity, while some volatile organic compounds released upon chewing act as specific cues to attract parasitoids [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. While many individual compounds are toxic to herbivores, others act as antifungal, antibacterial or allelopathic agents, or for priming of systemic defences in both the host and neighbouring plants [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. A recent area of research is the antiphytoviral activity of EOs. Although limited, the results to date indicate that these plant metabolites can trigger a response to viral infection [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Qualitative differences in EO composition of different plant species do not exhibit a uniform response that would explain the mechanism of antiphytoviral activity. Previous studies on the EOs of different plant species have led to the conclusion that sesquiterpene-rich oils can reduce viral infection in local host plants [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Synthesis of certain 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> sesquiterpenes, including β-caryophyllene, are induced by the phytohormones gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA), indicating that the production of these sesquiterpenes is integrated within the GA and JA signalling pathways [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Sesquiterpenes are the main oil components of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria croatica</italic> (Pers.) Schott described by Kremer et al. (2012) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], and this study aimed to determine its antiphytoviral potential for the prevention of diseases caused by plant viruses. As endemic Illyric-Balcanic species with small isolated populations, 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> (Lamiaceae) has been explored insufficiently to date. The EO composition of certain species can display annual variations, and variations in composition between populations. Genetic factors, evolution, geographic variation, environmental conditions (i.e., harvest date, planting time), physiological variations (i.e., organ and leaf position), and developmental stage are known to affect the biosynthesis of EOs [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Thus, the first objective of this study was to analyse the chemical composition of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> collected at three localities on Mt Velebit (Croatia), and to establish annual variations in oil composition, comparing the present results with those of a previous study [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The second objective was to analyse the uniformity of oil composition between 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> populations and to statistically analyse the results to clarify variations in the EO profile. The effect of these variations in the EO profile on the antiphytoviral activity of oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> was examined to determine whether this activity is independent of oil composition. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) was selected for determining the antiphytoviral activity of EO due to its wide host range of some one thousand plant species, including many of the most important crops. Some strains of CMV are associated with satellite RNA (satRNA), which depends on their helper virus for replication and movement [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and can have pronounced effects on host plant symptoms [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>].
