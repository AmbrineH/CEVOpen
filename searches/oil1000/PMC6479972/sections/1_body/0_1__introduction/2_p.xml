<p class="p">With the exception of our study dealing with the antiphytoviral activity of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria graeca</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], no other literature reports on the antiphytoviral activity of EOs within the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria</italic> were available. In this sense, the aim of this study was to provide answers to the following questions: (i) do the EO and the dominant components of oil (DC) of 
 <italic class="italic">M. croatica</italic> have antiphytoviral activity; (ii) do different application methods of EO/DC affect antiviral activity in local host plants; (iii) does an extended incubation time of the virus with EO/DC reflect on the antiviral activity in local host plants; (iv) do EO/DCs have the ability to activate a defensive response of local host plants against viruses; (v) does the prolongation of treatment with EO/DC prior to inoculation reflect on the antiviral activity in local host plants; (vi) do the above treatments affect virus concentrations in systemic host plants; (vii) is there a correlation between the antiviral activity of the EO and the antiviral activity of the DC of oil; and finally, (viii) is the antiviral activity constant due to differences in oil composition?
