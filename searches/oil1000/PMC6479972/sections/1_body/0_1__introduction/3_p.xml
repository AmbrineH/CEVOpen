<p class="p">The next step was to establish the antiviral activity of EOs by testing the expression of one of the genes important in plant defence against pathogens. Alternative oxidase (AOX) is the terminal oxidase of the cyanide-resistant alternative respiratory pathway in plants and has been implicated in resistance to viruses [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. While AOX abundance and alternative pathway activity are low in unstressed plants, both increase when plants are subjected to suboptimal conditions, such as chilling [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] or pathogen attack [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The AOX limits the formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in all plant species [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], and in stress conditions, AOX reduces ROS formation and has an active role in the adaptation of Arabidopsis to cold conditions [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Different species under similar stress conditions have a different response to the synthesis of AOX, though several Arabidopsis studies have described 
 <italic class="italic">Aox1a</italic> as the most stress responsive 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01342" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Based on the above, we proposed that at least one part of defence response mediated by EO involves a change of expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene. Since CMV is able to infect 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, we took advantage of this model system to investigate the correlation between essential oil treatment, 
 <italic class="italic">Aox</italic> gene expression and the development of viral infection.
