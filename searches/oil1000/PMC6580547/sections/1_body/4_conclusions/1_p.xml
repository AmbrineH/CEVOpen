<p id="Par31" class="p">In conclusion, this study shows that hemp sample from Benin republic is deficient in cannabinoids. It also shows that this hemp sample improves semen parameters by reducing plasma prolactin and enhancing plasma anti-oxidant status. It was opined that the pro-fertility effect of the Benin republic hemp sample could be due to its deficiency in the widely known gonadotoxic cannabinoids. This study has cautioned us from making a generalized claim that hemp is gonadotoxic. It shows that the origin of hemp samples might determine their composition and their ethno-pharmacological effects on the body functions.</p>
