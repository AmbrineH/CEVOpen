<p id="Par9" class="p">Thirty-six (36) adult male Wistar rats (weight range: 160–180 g) were obtained from the Department of Biochemistry, University of Ilorin, Nigeria. They were housed in wooden cages maintained under standardized conditions (12-h light/dark cycle, 27–30 °C, 50–80% relative humidity), and were acclimatized in the laboratory for 2 weeks before the commencement of the study. The rats were fed with standard pelletized rodent diet (Ace Feeds, Ibadan, Nigeria) and water ad libitum. All the animals were well-catered for according to the criteria outlined in the ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’ prepared by the National Academy of Science and approved by the Ethical Research Committee of the University of Ilorin, Nigeria.</p>
