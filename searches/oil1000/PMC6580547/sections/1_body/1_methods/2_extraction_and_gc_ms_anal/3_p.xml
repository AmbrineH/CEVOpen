<p id="Par12" class="p">The MS scanning was performed from M/Z85 to M/Z380. The GC-MS solution software provided by supplier was used to control the system and to acquire the data. The separation of the injected samples was carried out on an HP capillary column (HP-5MS). Identification of the compounds was carried out by comparing the mass spectra obtained with those of the standard mass spectra from National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) library (NIST II). Identification was based on the molecular structure, molecular mass and calculated fragments. The fatty acids and other organic compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of the standards. The quantity of each compound present was expressed as percentage of the total compounds.</p>
