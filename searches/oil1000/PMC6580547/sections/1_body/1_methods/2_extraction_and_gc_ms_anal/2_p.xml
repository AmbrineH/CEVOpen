<p id="Par11" class="p">A gas chromatography (GC) from AgilentCo. USA, hyphenated to a mass spectrometer (MS, 5975C) with triple axis detector equipped with an auto-injector (10 μl syringe) was used. Helium gas was used as a carrier gas. All chromatographic separation was performed on capillary column having the following specifications: length- 30 m, internal diameter- 0.25 μm, thickness- 250 μm, treated with phenylmethylsilox. Other gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) conditions are: ion source temperature (EI)- 250 °C, interface temperature- 300 °C, pressure- 16.2 psi, cut time- 1.8 min, 1.0 μL injector in splitless mode with split ratio 1:50 and injection temperature of 300 °C. The column temperature started at 35 °C for 5 min and changed to 150 °C at the rate of 4 °C/min for 2 min. The temperature was raised to 250 °C at the rate of 20 °C/min and held for 5 min.</p>
