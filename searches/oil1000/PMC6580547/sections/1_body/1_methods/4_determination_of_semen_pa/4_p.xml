<p id="Par18" class="p">The principle for determination of sperm morphology was based on the ability of morphologically normal sperm to appear white in color as the plasma membrane will prevent the dye to enter, while abnormal sperms take up the dye and stain dark color. The microscope slides and the eosin stain were pre-warmed to room temperature. One milliliter of the sperm suspension – normal saline solution was transferred to a test tube and 2 drops of 1% eosin were added and mixed gently for agitation. This was incubated for 45–60 min to allow its proper staining and then re-suspended with a Pasteur pipette. A clean grease-free glass slide was used. Potential damage to the sperm cells should be avoided. One or 2 drops of the stained sperm were placed approximately 1 cm from the end of the slide lying on a flat surface. A second slide was held with the slide’s long edge gently touching across the width of the sperm slide and pulled across to produce a sperm smear. After air-drying the slide, using a microscope at 100X objective, the sperm cells were examined. The sperm along the periphery was normally excluded from the examination because there is a greater tendency for artifacts to occur in these regions. At least, five fields were viewed covering the whole slide. Examples of morphological abnormalities are double-headed, elongated head, pyriform head, bent head, bent tail, bent mid-piece, coiled tail, double tail, headless, tailless, etc. All those with normal morphology were recorded as N while the total number of the counted spermatozoa was recorded as T. The percentage sperm morphology was calculated as (N/T × 100%).</p>
