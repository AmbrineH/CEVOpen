<p id="Par16" class="p">The testes from each rat were carefully exposed and one of them was removed together with its epididymis. For each separated epididymis, the caudal part was removed and placed in a beaker containing 1â€‰ml of normal saline solution. It was macerated with a pair of sharp scissors and left for few minutes to liberate the sperm cells into the normal saline. Semen drops were placed on a clean grease-free glass slide and two drops of warm 2.9% sodium citrate were added. The improved Neubauer counting chamber was charged with the semen solution and the number of sperm cells, appearing as black dots, was counted in 25 small squares within the central counting area of the counting chamber.</p>
