<p id="Par17" class="p">The sperm suspension was diluted in 1 ml of normal saline solution. About 10 L was pipetted onto a clean grease free glass slide. A cover slip was lowered onto the sample on the slide, avoiding air bubbles, and the slide was examined using a microscope with a 40X objective. At least, six widely spaced fields were examined to provide an estimate of the percentage of the progressively motile sperm cells. The sperm cells with progressive motility were estimated and recorded as (N) while the total number of all the sperm cells counted was recorded as (T). Sperm motility (%) was calculated using (N/T × 100%).</p>
