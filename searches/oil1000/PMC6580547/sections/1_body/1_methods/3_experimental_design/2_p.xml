 <italic class="italic">im</italic>). Thereafter, they were dissected in order to collect blood by cardiac puncture. Whole blood for the determination of the biochemical markers were collected in heparinized sample bottles which were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for about 10 min at -4 °C using a cold centrifuge (Model 8881, manufacturer: Centurion Scientific Ltd., United Kingdom). The separated plasma samples were collected into separate plain bottles and were stored at -20 °C prior to the biochemical analyses.
