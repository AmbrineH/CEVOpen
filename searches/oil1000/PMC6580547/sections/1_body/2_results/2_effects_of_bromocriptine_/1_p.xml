<p id="Par22" class="p">Bromocriptine-treated rats had higher sperm count but unchanged sperm motility, morphology and viability when compared to control. Both doses of BHE increased the sperm count, morphology and viability but not sperm motility when compared to control. Rats that were co-administered with either dose of BHE and bromocriptine had lower sperm count but higher sperm morphology and viability when compared to rats that received bromocriptine alone (Fig.Â
