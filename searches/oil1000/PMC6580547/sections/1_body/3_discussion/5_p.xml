<p id="Par29" class="p">The release of prolactin from adenohypophysis is under tonic inhibition of dopamine, which is delivered to adenohypophysis from the hypothalamus via the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system. Dopamine decreases prolactin secretion by binding to the dopamine D2 receptors on the surface of lactotroph and diminishing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level. We have previously shown that increase in the plasma prolactin level is one of the mechanisms through which Nigerian hemp induces male gonadotoxicity [

Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that has been used for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Administration of bromocriptine alone increased sperm count but did not significantly affect other semen parameters. However, it synergizes with hemp extract to enhance sperm morphology and viability (though there were decreases in sperm count), which tends to involve the FSH and testosterone. Moreover, the plasma level of prolactin was decreased by both doses of the hemp extract and/or bromocriptine, while there were no significant changes in the plasma GnRH, gonadotropins (FSH and LH), and testosterone in hemp-treated rats. Similarly, previous studies have reported normal serum levels of gonadotropins but elevated serum prolactin in azoospermic or oligospermic patients, providing evidence for the sole role of prolactin on spermatogenesis independent of gonadotropins [

Our current data also suggest that the pro-fertility potential of Benin republic hemp is partly mediated through inhibition of endogenous prolactin but independent of HPT axis. This is different from the Nigerian hemp that induces gonadotoxicity through hyperprolactinemia and down regulation of HPT axis [
