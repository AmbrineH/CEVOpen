<p id="Par26" class="p">Because about 35% of the available oil has been reported to remain in the seed cake following pressing process while supercritical carbon dioxide extraction has been documented as a better alternative to pressing or organic solvent methods for extraction of lipids such as PUFAs from fish lipids and vegetable oils [

However, this possibility is annulled by their previous observation that there was no difference between the fatty acid composition obtained from hempseed oil following Soxhlet apparatus or by supercritical carbon dioxide method of extraction [
