<p id="Par30" class="p">Apart from hyperprolactinemia and down-regulation of HPT axis, we have further previously shown that the gonadotoxic effect of Nigerian hemp is also mediated through oxidative stress [

In the current study, we investigated if the pro-fertility effect of Benin republic hemp will be related to an enhanced plasma anti-oxidant status. We observed that the hemp extract enhanced the TAC, which is accounted for by SOD and catalase but not GPx. This agrees with a previous study that observed that hemp seed oil has free radical scavenging potential even more than olive oil [

Like the pattern observed for the sperm morphology and viability, there was a synergistic relationship between bromocriptine and hemp extract to enhance the plasma anti-oxidant status.
