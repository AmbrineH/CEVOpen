<p id="Par25" class="p">Hemp seeds have been developed into numerous products for food, cosmetic, therapeutic, functional food and nutraceutical industries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. The presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in hemp seed oil has been extensively documented. It contains α-linolenic acid (omega-3 PUFA) and linoleic acid (omega-6 PUFA), both of which are essential fatty acids required to prevent cardio-metabolic disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. It also contains γ-linolenic acid, which makes it as an ideal ingredient for cosmetics (lipid-enriched creams, light body oils, etc.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Though the present study did not identify PUFAs (α-linolenic and linoleic acids) in BHE as reported by authors that analyzed hemp from other sources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], we however observed that it is a rich source of saturated (palmitic and stearic acids) and monounsaturated (oleic acid) fatty acids [
