<p id="Par28" class="p">The beneficial effect of lipids on semen parameters has been well-documented. Cholesterol has been reported to increase cell membrane stability and decrease the transition temperature from the fluid to the gelatinous phase [

We have also recently observed that THC inhibits the hyper-activated motility of capacitated rat sperms by reducing sperm velocities (average path, curvilinear, and straight-line), amplitude of lateral head displacement, and beat cross frequency [

The improvement in semen parameters by BHE could thus be partly associated with its fatty acid constituents and its comparative deficiency in cannabinoids, while the abundant proportion of cannabinoids in Nigerian hemp could have superimposed its fatty acids and lead to gonadotoxicity as previously reported by us [
