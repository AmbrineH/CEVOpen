<p id="Par6" class="p">There have been evidences that the hyperprolactinemia-induced infertility is reversible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. A simple medication like bromocriptine or cabergoline, which normalizes serum prolactin levels, has been consistently shown to restore gonadal functions, reverse infertility caused by hyperprolactinemia, and reduces prolactinoma size in majority of patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Thus, we also speculated that the hemp-induced gonadotoxicity mediated through hyperprolactinemia and down-regulation of HPT axis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] might be reversed or prevented by inhibiting endogenous prolactin secretion with bromocriptine.
