<p id="Par7" class="p">The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) of Nigeria, through series of online and print media publications, has recently observed that most of the illegal hemp users in Nigeria have been preferentially obtaining hemp from Benin republic. The NDLEA also observed that users now compress this imported hemp and soak it with ethanol prior to its use; and that the “high” and euphoria felt by users of Nigerian and Benin republic hemp are comparatively different. It is not yet known whether there is difference in the quality of both hemp samples or not. The present study determined and compared the compositions of Benin republic hemp ethanol extract (BHE) and Nigerian hemps.</p>
