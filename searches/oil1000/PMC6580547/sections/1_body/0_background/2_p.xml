<p id="Par5" class="p">Hyperprolactinemia has been reported to have a definite role in male infertility. It causes infertility in about 11% of oligospermic males [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] by inhibiting gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatile secretion
 <bold class="bold">,</bold> which impliedly decreases gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]) and testosterone secretion. This prolactin-induced down-regulation of HPT axis ultimately leads to spermatogenic arrest, altered sperm quality, impaired sperm motility, and later produces secondary hypogonadism and male infertility. In addition to this indirect effect, hyperprolactinemia also directly influences steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis by acting on prolactin receptors present in Leydig and Sertoli cells in the testes to produce primary hypogonadism and male infertility [
