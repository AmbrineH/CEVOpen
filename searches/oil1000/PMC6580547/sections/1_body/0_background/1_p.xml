 <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic> (hemp), the most widely abused recreational drug worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], is becoming globally legalized due to its medicinal use by patients with epilepsy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>], inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>], cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>], pain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], etc. Furthermore, many synthetic compounds that act on the endocannabinoid system have been extensively studied in recent years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>], germ cell proliferation and reproductive organ weight [
