  <p id="Par1" class="p">Nigerian 
   <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic> (hemp) causes male gonadotoxicity by inducing hyperprolactinemia, down-regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, and oxidative stress. Benin republic hemp has been preferred by illicit users in Nigeria but its effect on male fertility is not understood. This study determined and compared the compositions of Benin republic hemp ethanol extract (BHE) and Nigerian hemp. The effects of BHE on semen parameters, reproductive hormones, and anti-oxidant status, and the possibility of bromocriptine (prolactin inhibitor) to abolish hemp-induced toxicities in rats were also investigated.

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">Thirty-six male Wistar rats were blindly randomized into 6 oral treatment groups (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6 each). Groups I (control) and II received normal saline and bromocriptine (3 mg/kg) respectively. Groups III and IV received 2 mg/kg of BHE alone and in combination with bromocriptine respectively, while groups V and VI received 10 mg/kg BHE alone and in combination with bromocriptine respectively. Comparisons among the groups were done by one-way analysis of variance, followed by 
   <italic class="italic">post-hoc</italic> Tukey multiple comparison test. Statistical significance was considered at

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">The BHE has no cannabichromene and tetrahydrocannabinol but a very small quantity of cannabinol and higher quantity of fatty acids when compared to Nigerian hemp. Both doses of BHE increased sperm count, morphology and viability but not motility. Co-administration of BHE with bromocriptine lowered sperm count but increased sperm morphology and viability. Bromocriptine and/or BHE caused reduction in the plasma prolactin level, increase in the plasma superoxide dismutase activity, but no significant change in the plasma gonadotropin releasing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (except for the increase in rats that received bromocriptine+ 10 mg/kg BHE), luteinizing hormone, estradiol, malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase. The 10 mg/kg BHE or bromocriptine+BHE (both doses) increased total anti-oxidant capacity and catalase.</p>

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">The BHE improves semen parameters by reducing plasma prolactin and enhancing plasma anti-oxidant status. Its pro-fertility potential might be associated with its deficiency in the widely known gonadotoxic phytocannabinoids.</p>
