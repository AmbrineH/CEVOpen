 <xref rid="B26-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. To improve the extract dispersion in oil, the EVOOCar sample was sonicated for 2 min and then shaded for 10 min. Finally, the sample appeared homogeneous and without particulate matter. EVOO and EVOOCar were immediately analyzed and represented the sample at time zero.
