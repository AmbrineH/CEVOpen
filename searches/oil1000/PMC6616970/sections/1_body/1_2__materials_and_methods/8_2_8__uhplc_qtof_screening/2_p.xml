<p class="p">Afterward, the phenolic compounds in EVOO samples collected after 0, 20, and 28 weeks of storage were screened through UHPLC/QTOF-MS, using a 1290 liquid chromatograph coupled with a G6550 mass spectrometer detector, via a Dual JetStream Electrospray Ionization System (all from Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). UHPLC/QTOF-MS analytical conditions for the analysis of phenolic compounds in EVOO samples were optimized in previous experiments [
