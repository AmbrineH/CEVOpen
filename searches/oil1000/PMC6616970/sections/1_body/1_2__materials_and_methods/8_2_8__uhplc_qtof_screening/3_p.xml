<p class="p">The raw data were then processed using the Agilent Profinder B.07 software, according to the ‘find-by-formula’ algorithm. Monoisotopic accurate mass was used together with the whole isotope pattern (isotopic spacing and isotopic ratio) to achieve a higher confidence for identification. The database exported from Phenol-Explorer 3.6 was used as a reference for identification, adopting a 5-ppm tolerance for mass accuracy. Recursive identification and filter-by-frequency were applied as post-acquisition processing: features that were not present in 100% replications within at least one treatment were discarded. This processed dataset was finally used for statistics and chemometrics purposes. Furthermore, polyphenols annotated were ascribed into classes and sub-classes and then cumulative intensities were calculated. Methanolic standard solutions of individual phenolics (starting from pure compounds, purity &gt; 97% and provided from Extrasynthese, Lyon, France) were then injected. Sesamin (lignans), ferulic acid (hydroxycinnamic acids and other phenolic acids), luteolin (flavones and other remaining flavonoids), and tyrosol (hydroxytyrosols and tyrosol-equivalents) were used as representative of their respective classes. With this purpose, a linear fitting (not weighed and not forced to origin) was built and used for quantitative purposes. The abundance for each class was expressed as mg/kg equivalents of the reference compound within the same class.</p>
