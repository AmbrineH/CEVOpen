<p class="p">Aliquots of EVOO and EVOOCar samples were stored in 30-mL amber glass bottles, in the dark at 20 °C for 28 weeks. Three 30 mL aliquots of EVOO and three 30 mL aliquots of EVOOCar have been prepared for each storage time, including the samples at time zero. The samples were analyzed every 4 weeks up to 28 weeks; the samples were also stored at −20 °C to complete the analyses. Oil stability was evaluated by measuring acidity value (AV), peroxide value (PV), specific absorptivity at 232 and 270 nm, fatty acid (FA) composition, and carotenoid and α-tocopherol contents. Furthermore, comprehensive phenolic profiling, based on UHPLC/QTOF-MS, was used.</p>
