<p class="p">Carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin dipalmitate, and α-tocopherol were eluted using a C30 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Nomura Co., Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a C30 guard column (20 × 4.6 mm) using mobile phases consisting of methanol and MTBE. The conditions for the analysis and the validation of the method were reported in a previous work [
