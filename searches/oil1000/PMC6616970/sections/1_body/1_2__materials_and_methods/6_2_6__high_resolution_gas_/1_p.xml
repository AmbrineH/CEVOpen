<p class="p">The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of triacylglycerols (TAG) were prepared by transesterification as reported in a previous work [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The analysis of FAME was carried out using a Dani GC1000 gas chromatograph (Norwalk, CT, USA) equipped with a split/splitless injector port and a Flame Ionization Detector. The fused silica WCOT capillary column CP-Select CB for FAME (50 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm f.t., Varian, Superchrom, Milan, Italy) was used. The chromatograms were acquired and processed using Clarity integration software (DataApex Ltd., Prague, Czech Republic). The chromatographic conditions were the following: The injector and detector temperature was 250 °C; the oven temperature was 180 °C, held for 6 min then increased to 250 °C at 3 °C/min; the final temperature was held for 10 min. The carrier gas (He) flow rate was 1.0 mL/min.
