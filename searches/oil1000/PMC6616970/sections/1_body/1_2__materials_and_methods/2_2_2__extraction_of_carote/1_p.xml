After that, the extracted fractions were pooled and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The final residue was weighed, dissolved in MTBE, and immediately analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry chromatography-diode array detector-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS), as described in
