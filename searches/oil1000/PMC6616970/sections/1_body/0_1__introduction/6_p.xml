<p class="p">In a previous work [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], it has been reported that the addition of a carotenoid-rich extract from 
 <italic class="italic">Lycium barbarum</italic> L. can help to improve the oxidative stability of EVOO during a frying process. In recent years, the interest in 
 <italic class="italic">L. barbarum</italic> fruit increased, due to its high amount of bioactive compounds including polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], phytosterols [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], minerals, and carotenoids [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], but also simple sugars [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The main object of this work was to study the effect of EVOO enrichment with a carotenoid-rich extract from 
 <italic class="italic">L. barbarum</italic> in terms of chemical-physical change and heat stability during long-term storage. Besides the known chemical parameters typically considered in oil thermal stability assessments, our work aimed to investigate the changes of the main phenolic classes by applying a metabolomic approach based on untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QTOF-MS).
