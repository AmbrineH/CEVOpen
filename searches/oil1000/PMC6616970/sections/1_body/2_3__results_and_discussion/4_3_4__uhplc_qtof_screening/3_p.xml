<p class="p">Afterward, the multivariate supervised orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was carried out in order to investigate the chemical changes induced by the long-term storage. In particular, the OPLS-DA model was built considering three time points, being 0, 20, and 28 weeks of storage. The OPLS-DA score plot obtained by using this multivariate approach is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00179-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. This OPLS model was characterized by excellent model parameters, being R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>Y = 0.99 (goodness of fit) and Q
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>Y = 0.88 (goodness of prediction). Besides, the model was cross-validated and inspected for outliers, as reported in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-08-00179" class="xref">Table S2</xref>. Looking at the output obtained, great discrimination among the two group of samples (i.e., EVOO and EVOOCar) could be observed, likely due to the addition of Goji carotenoid extract. In this regard, the major differences could be outlined in EVOOCar after 28 weeks of storage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00179-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, a second model was built to exclusively compare EVOO and EVOOCar at 28 weeks of storage (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-08-00179" class="xref">Table S2</xref>) in order to confirm the changes promoted by the addition of carotenoid extract at this time-point. The VIP selection method was used to evaluate the importance of the variables in the projection of the OPLS-DA model, and then to outline the phenolic classes most affected by the addition of the Goji carotenoid. Interestingly, the VIP approach identified 70 compounds able to discriminate the two different groups of samples, belonging to the subclasses of phenolic acids, flavones, and tyrosol equivalents. These VIP markers are reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00179-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> together with their individual score (&gt;1), log fold-change (FC) values, and the corresponding up/down-regulation. As can be observed from 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00179-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the majority of flavones equivalents were characterized by an overall up-regulation (75%) when considering the comparison EVOOCar vs. EVOO during 28 weeks of storage. In particular, 10 compounds were characterized by logFC values higher than 15, such as naringin 6â€™-malonate and neodiosmin. When considering the other VIP markers for the same comparison (i.e., EVOOCar vs. EVOO), tyrosol equivalents (i.e., 81%) showed the same up-regulation trend. In fact, only a few compounds were down-regulated, with 10 compounds possessing logFC values higher than 10 (such as
