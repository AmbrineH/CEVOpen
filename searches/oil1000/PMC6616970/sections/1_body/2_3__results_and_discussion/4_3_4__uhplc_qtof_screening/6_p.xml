<p class="p">Some researchers investigated the evolution in the phenolic composition of oils during 21 months of storage at room temperature, finding that the reduction of total phenolics ranged from 43% up to 73% and was higher in samples whose initial phenolic contents were greater [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In particular, storage can affect the phenolic profile of oil through oxidative stress phenomena and the consequent formation of oxidized phenolics [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. For example, 3,4-DHPEA and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-HPEA-EA are reported to increase during long-term storage, and therefore the ratio fresh/oxidized phenolics has been proposed as a marker of the freshness/aging of different oils, while hydroxytyrosol concentration is reported to decrease and closely correlated with the oxidative stability of the olive oil [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that 3,4-DHPEA-EA and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-HPEA-EA increased two-fold in EVOOCar after 28 weeks of storage, while hydroxytyrosol showed a decreasing trend of âˆ’25% (
