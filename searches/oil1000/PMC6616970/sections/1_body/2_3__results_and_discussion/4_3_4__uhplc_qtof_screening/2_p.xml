<p class="p">In this regard, the phenolic acids class was characterized by 25 hydroxybenzoics, 68 hydroxycinnamics, and 5 hydroxyphenylacetics. Among hydroxybenzoics, isomeric forms of dihydroxybenzoic acid were very frequent, followed by syringic and vanillic acids. Besides, looking to the hydroxycinnamics subclass, an abundance of isomeric forms of coumaric and ferulic acids was noticed. According to the phenolic composition reported for EVOO, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid were the most represented among the hydroxyphenylacetic acids (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-HPEA-EDA were particularly abundant in the EVOO samples, followed by oleuropein, ligstrosides and their aglycones, and tyrosols and hydroxytyrosols. Interestingly, the distribution of these compounds was in compliance with the EVOO composition reported in Phenol-Explorer. Moreover, with respect to the class of flavonoids, the flavones apigenin and luteolin (together with their glycosidic forms) were the most frequent compounds annotated. Finally, in our experimental conditions, two of the most reported lignans in EVOO were also detected, being pinoresinol and 1-acetoxypinoresinol (
