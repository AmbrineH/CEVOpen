<p class="p">The semi-quantitative analysis of the major phenolic classes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00179-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>) clearly depicted the impact of Goji carotenoids on the entire phenolic profile during long-term storage. In fact, the phenolic acids content in EVOOCar remained between 4.70 and 4.35 mg/kg, almost stable during the entire time of storage. Instead, EVOO showed deep changes during storage, recording a 39% reduction after 28 weeks. Similarly, the tyrosol equivalents content of EVOOCar moved from 480.0 to 463.0 after 20 weeks, then presented a slight decrease at 28 weeks (−19%). In contrast, EVOO sample was characterized by a general decrease in tyrosol equivalents content, reaching 290.00 mg/kg after 28 weeks (−40%). When considering the other phenolic classes investigated by exploiting the metabolomics-based approach, the flavone content showed clear semi-quantitative differences between EVOOCar and EVOO, particularly marked after 20 weeks, at 35 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Finally, lignans were found to be the most affected class of compounds during storage. In fact, after 20 weeks, the abundance of these compounds drastically decreased in EVOO sample when compared to EVOOCar, at −55% vs. −7% reduction, respectively.
