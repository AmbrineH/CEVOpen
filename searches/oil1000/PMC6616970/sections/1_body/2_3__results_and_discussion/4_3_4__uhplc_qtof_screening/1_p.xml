<p class="p">The changes of the polyphenol profiles during long-term storage of EVOO and EVOOCar were investigated by means of a UHPLC/QTOF mass spectrometry approach. In particular, this high-resolution method annotated (i.e., according to a Level 2 of accuracy, as set out by the COSMOS Metabolomics Standard Initiative) more than 400 compounds, consisting of 71 anthocyanins, 95 flavones, 93 flavonols, 29 lignans, 14 alkylphenols, 65 tyrosols, 100 phenolic acids, and 10 stilbenes. The polyphenols annotated with this approach are reported in the

However, considering the typical EVOO phenolic composition, as set out in both Phenol-Explorer 3.6 (i.e., the most comprehensive database on polyphenol content in foods) and the literature [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], we highlighted the changes of the most important phenolic classes, being flavones, phenolic acids (i.e., hydroxybenzoics, hydroxycinnamics, and hydroxyphenylacetics), lignans, and tyrosol equivalents.
