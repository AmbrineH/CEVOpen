<p class="p">In this work, we demonstrated that the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. barbarum</italic> carotenoids to EVOO during long-term storage could preserve from oxidation processes its main polyphenol composition (i.e., flavones, lignans, phenolic acids, and tyrosol equivalents). In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the prediction/evolution of antioxidant compounds characterizing EVOO during storage [

 <xref rid="B47-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. However, it is important to emphasize that results from different studies on EVOO polyphenols are difficult to compare because of the variety of methods proposed for their determination. For example, most works used spectrophotometric methods, such as Folin-Ciocalteu, to determine changes in polyphenols during EVOO and VOO storages [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]; however, these methods are not only specific for phenols, thus hindering the comparability between similar studies. That is why LC-MS are now recommended to quantify antioxidant compounds in food matrices [
