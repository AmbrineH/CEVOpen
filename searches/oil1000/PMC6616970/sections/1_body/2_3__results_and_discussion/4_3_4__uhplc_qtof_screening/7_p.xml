<p class="p">In a previous work [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], we evaluated the changes of the main polyphenol classes in EVOO added with Goji carotenoids during frying; in particular, we demonstrated that the decrease of phenolics was lower in EVOOCar than in EVOO during thermal processing, thus postulating the exploitation of a carotenoid extract from 
 <italic class="italic">L. barbarum</italic> to improve the oxidative stability of EVOO. In recent years, different sources of natural bioactive ingredients and extraction conditions have been described for the development of novel functional virgin olive oil [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In this regard, the most exploited sources derived from the same olive tree (mainly leaves or olive pomace) and from the use of plants and vegetables, mainly herbs and spices. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work highlighting the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">L. barbarum</italic> carotenoids as a valuable tool to preserve the phenolic profile of EVOO during long-term storage. In a previous work, it has been demonstrated that carotenoid-rich extracts from microalgae added to VOO can help in improving the oxidative stability and, as a consequence, olive oil shelf-life and nutritional value [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, the same authors concluded that the assessment of the stability of these enriched-oils represents a challenge, thus requiring further studies. In particular, scientific research must also focus on determining the exact amount of protective extracts that should be incorporated to not alter oil quality parameters and to improve its health-promoting properties [
