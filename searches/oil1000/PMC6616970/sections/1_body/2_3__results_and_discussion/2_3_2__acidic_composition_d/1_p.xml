<p class="p">In EVOO and EVOOCar samples, the content of saturated fatty acids (SFA), mainly represented from palmitic, stearic and arachidic acids, was 14.6%. Both oils showed a high percentage of MUFA (78.6%), essentially represented by oleic acid, typical of EVOO. A lower percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 6.8%), represented by the essential FA linoleic and α-linolenic acids, was found. In details, the FA% compositions of EVOO and EVOOCar at different storage times are shown in the

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in EVOOCar, for the presence of antioxidants naturally present in EVOO and of carotenoid-rich extract. On the contrary, in a previous paper it has been reported that, during EVOO frying, MUFA (oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic and α-linolenic acids) showed a significant percentage loss, while they remained constant or slightly changed in EVOOCar [

Other researchers reported that the addition of sesame seed oil caused a significant change in the fatty acid composition in EVOO, as a function of mixture levels and storage period. Other literature data, regarding the effects of long-term storage on vegetable oils, are in agreement with our results [
