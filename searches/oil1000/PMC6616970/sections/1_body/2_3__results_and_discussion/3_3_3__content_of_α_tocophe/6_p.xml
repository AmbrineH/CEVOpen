<p class="p">In this research, a low concentration of Goji carotenoids has been added to EVOO to avoid the pro-oxidant effect [

 <xref rid="foods-08-00179-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the content (mg/100 mL) of lutein, β-carotene, and zeaxanthin dipalmitate, during the storage of EVOO and EVOOCar. The main pigment of EVOO is the lutein (3,3′-dihydroxy-α-carotene), followed by β-carotene. The content of lutein observed in the starting EVOO was around 1.0 mg/100 mL, a considerably high value in respect to the values reported in the literature for other EVOO samples [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. At the end of the storage, the content of β-carotene and lutein in EVOO and EVOOCar showed slight decreases in respect to time zero. Zeaxanthin dipalmitate, the most abundant carotenoid compound of Goji berries [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], decreased slightly in EVOOCar until the end of the storage, showing statistical differences in respect to time zero (
