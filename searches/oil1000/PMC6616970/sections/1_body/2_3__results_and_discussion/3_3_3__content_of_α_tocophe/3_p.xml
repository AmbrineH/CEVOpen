 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00179-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the trend of α-tocopherol content in EVOO and in EVOOCar during the storage. The initial α-tocopherol levels were fairly constant for both oils up to the 12th week. After this time, the α-tocopherol content of EVOO decreased significantly (

Different results have been obtained monitoring α-tocopherol content in EVOO and EVOO during frying [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In fact, a significant decrease of α-tocopherol was observed both in EVOO and EVOOCar, already after 20 min of frying. Other researchers also reported that tocopherol content markedly decreased in sunflower oil during accelerated storage and coriander essential oil addition significantly limited this loss [

On the contrary, the results of this research are in agreement with those reported by Montesano and collaborators, which observed that the addition of lycopene to EVOO, in suitable concentrations, preserved the major part of α-tocopherol initially present in the oil [
