<p class="p">Lipid deterioration in oils/fats may proceed essentially by enzyme-catalyzed hydrolytic cleavage, chemical hydrolytic cleavage, and atmospheric oxygen-driven oxidative lipid (autoxidation). Hydrolysis process results in the formation of free fatty acids (FFA) and partial esters of glycerol from triacylglycerols (mono- and diacylglycerols). Hydrolysis products decrease the stability of oils/fats and can be used to evaluate oil storage shelf-life, for example, measuring the AV. These types of alterations can be due to the presence of enzymes and water, as commonly happens with cloudy oils that are freshly obtained in oil mills.
