<p class="p">During storage, food lipids can undergo oxidative phenomena, affecting the nutritional value of foods. Particularly deleterious for EVOO quality is the autoxidation process, enhanced by oxygen, light, heat, and heavy metals. Peroxides are intermediates of this type of reaction, so the PV determination is the official method, approved to evaluate the entity of oil primary oxidation, according to the European regulation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00179-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the trend of PV of EVOO and EVOOCar during long-term storage. The PV of EVOO and EVOOCar remained fairly constant up to the 16th week, after which both oils showed an increasing trend of PV until the end of the storage (14 and 12 meqO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg for EVOO and EVOOCar, respectively). In any case, the PV of both oils remained within the maximum legal value acidity limit (20 meqO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg for EVOO) established by European Regulation [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. At the end of the storage, the PV both for EVOO and EVOOCar were significantly different (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in respect to time zero. Furthermore, significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) were also observed between the PV of the two different oils after the 28th week, in fact, the PV of EVOOCar was lower than the PV of EVOO. These results indicate that the carotenoid-rich extract is able to provide antioxidant protection against primary lipid oxidation. These results are in agreement with other literature data. For example, some researchers showed that during the first 13 weeks no remarkable variations were observed between oils added with lycopene and non-added oil. The authors also reported that at the end of the storage the PV was lower the maximum allowed by law for enriched oils, while it was around 40 meqO
