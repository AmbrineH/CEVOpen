<p class="p">The determination of specific extinction values (K232 and K268) is the official method, established by European Regulation [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-08-00179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], for the evaluation of the degree of degradation of oils, linked to the production of peroxy radicals, unsaturated hydroperoxides, carbonyl conjugated compounds, and conjugated double bonds. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00179-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the trends of K232 (A) and K268 (B) of EVOO and EVOOCar during long-term storage. During the storage, an increasing trend of K232 up to 2.50 and 2.40 was observed for the EVOO and EVOOCar, respectively, while K268 remained almost constant. The increasing trend showed for K232 was similar to the increasing trend of PV values at the same time, in fact, a good correlation between PV and K232 values (0.8532 and 0.8577, respectively for EVOO and EVOOCar) was found.
