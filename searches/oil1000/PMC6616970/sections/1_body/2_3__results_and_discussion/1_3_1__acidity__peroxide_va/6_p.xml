<p class="p">This aspect could be linked to the fact that K232 is due to the absorbance of primary oxidation products (i.e., peroxy radicals, hydroperoxides, conjugated double bonds), and that PV is the index of primary lipid oxidation. The values of K of both oils (EVOO and EVOOCar) remain within the maximum limit set by the European regulation 2016/2095 (2.50 for K232 and 0.22 for K268). At the end of the storage of EVOO and EVOOCar, significant differences (
