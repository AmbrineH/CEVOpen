<p class="p">The results of this work suggest that the addition of a Goji carotenoid-rich extract to EVOO could be useful to produce novel nutraceutical oil, with improved oxidative stability, shelf-life, and nutritional value in respect to the original one. The addition of natural antioxidants, for example, Goji carotenoids with well-known healthy properties, opens the way to the market of enriched oils with a nutritional-added value. To this aim, in a successive phase of the research, a wider EVOO sampling should be considered, taking into account the variability of EVOO composition. The UHPLC/QTOF-MS-based metabolomics analysis of EVOO and EVOOCar was highly informative, allowing the discrimination between the two series of oils (added and not added), during long-term storage. The results of this work suggest that UHPLC/QTOF-MS-based metabolomics analysis is a suitable approach to detect biomarkers, including phenolic compounds, useful in the field of food quality/safety, that indicate degradation resulting from the long-term storage of EVOO.</p>
