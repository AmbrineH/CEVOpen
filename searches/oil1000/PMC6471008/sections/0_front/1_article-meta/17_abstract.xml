 <p class="p">In recent years, people have become more conscious about the side-effects of fluoride toothpastes and herbal products have drawn attention as alternatives in the struggle against caries. Studies have focused on the benefits of essential oils obtained from herbs because of their antibacterial effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of 
  <italic class="italic">Origanum dubium</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> oils combined with herbal toothpastes against 
  <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic>. The antibacterial activity of the test materials was determined using the agar well diffusion method before and after the addition of essential oils. We tested the efficacy of Splat Organic and Splat Biocalcium against 
  <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> (12 mm and 11 mm, respectively) doubled in combination with 
  <italic class="italic">Origanum dubium</italic> (23 mm for both toothpastes) and tripled with 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> (38 mm and 36 mm, respectively). Jack Nâ€™ Jill toothpaste, which did not initially show any antibacterial effect, exhibited the largest inhibition zones after the addition of the essential oils (38 mm for 
  <italic class="italic">Origanum dubium</italic> and 39 mm for 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic>). The results of this study pointed out that herbal toothpastes exhibit statistically higher antibacterial activity against 
  <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than their initial forms after the addition of essential oils.
