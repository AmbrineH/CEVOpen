 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest antibacterial activities were observed with the 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> essential oil and its combination with Jack N’ Jill and Splat Organic, and there was no statistical difference between them (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> combination with Splat Biocalcium showed lower antibacterial activity than the other 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.05), but higher antibacterial activity than all the other groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The lowest antibacterial activities were observed for distilled water, which was the negative control group of this study, and Jack N’ Jill, with no statistical difference between them (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Regarding the toothpastes and control groups, 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> showed higher antibacterial activity than 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> in combination with Jack N’ Jill showed higher antibacterial activity than the combination with Splat Organic and Splat Biocalcium (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), where there was no statistical difference between these two groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). After the addition of essential oils, the antibacterial activity of the toothpastes was observed to be higher than Colgate Total, which was the positive control group of this study (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In addition, there was no statistical difference between Colgate Total, Splat Organic, and Splat Biocalcium (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
