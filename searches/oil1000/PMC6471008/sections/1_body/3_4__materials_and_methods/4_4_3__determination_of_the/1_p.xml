<p class="p">The antibacterial effects of toothpastes were determined using the agar-well diffusion method. Mueller-Hinton Agar plates (90 mm in diameter) with 5% defibrinated horse blood and 20 mg/L β-NAD (BioMerieux SA, Marcy-l’Etolle, France) were used. Up to three wells were created in the agar of each plate by removing plugs cut with a sterile 6 mm diameter stainless steel biopsy punch. 45 milligrams of each toothpaste used in this study was diluted with 45 µL distilled water and homogenized in a vortex mixer (Combi-Spin, BioSan, Riga, Latvia) for 3 min. The sonicator (Gen-probe, San Diego, CA, USA) was applied for 5 min in the finalizer to complete the dissolution. Distilled water was used as a control group.</p>
