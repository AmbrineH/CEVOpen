 <xref rid="B75-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Sterile filter paper disks, 6 mm in diameter, were impregnated with 45 µL of each essential oil directly and discs was left to dry for 15 min. The plates were inoculated with 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> ATCC 35668 (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) to examine the antibacterial activity. Bacteria were cultured on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood (BioMerieux SA, Marcy-l’Etolle, France) and were grown anaerobically at 37 °C for 24 h (EC 160 CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Incubator, Nuve, Ankara, Turkey). Several colonies of cultured bacteria were transferred in inoculum saline (MicroScan Inoculum Saline, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA) and the density was adjusted to McFarland Standard 0.5 (MicroScan Turbidity Meter, Siemens, Deerfield, IL, USA). A total of 0.1 mL bacterial suspension in inoculum saline taken by sterile ecuvion was spread to the Mueller-Hinton Agar plates (90 mm in diameter) with 5% defibrinated horse blood and 20 mg/L β-NAD (β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) (BioMerieux SA, Marcy-l’Etolle, France). Then, the paper discs impregnated with essential oils were placed on inoculated agar plates and were grown at 37 °C for 24 h (EC 160 CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> Incubator, Nuve, Ankara, Turkey). Antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ) of the tested bacteria.
