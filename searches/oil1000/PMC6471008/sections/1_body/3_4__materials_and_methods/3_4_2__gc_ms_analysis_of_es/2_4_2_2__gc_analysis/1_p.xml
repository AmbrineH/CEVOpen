<p class="p">The GC analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6890 N GC system. The FID (Flame Ionization Detector) detector temperature was 300 Â°C. To obtain the same elution order with GC-MS, simultaneous auto-injection was carried out on a duplicate of the same column applying the same operational conditions. The relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were calculated from FID chromatograms. The analysis results are provided in
