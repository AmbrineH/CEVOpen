<p class="p">The same procedure as used for the determination of the antibacterial effect of the toothpastes was applied to grow the bacteria and spread them to the agar plates containing the toothpastes and measure the diameter of the inhibition zones. The diameters of each area of growth inhibition were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm by viewing the bottom of the agar plate. A total of 15 replicates were performed for each agent. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) of the tested bacteria.</p>
