<p class="p">The antibacterial effects of the experimental and control groups were determined using the agar-well diffusion method. For this purpose, Mueller-Hinton Agar plates 90 mm in diameter with 5% defibrinated horse blood and 20 mg/L β-NAD (BioMerieux SA, Marcy-l’Etolle, France) were used. Up to three wells were created in the agar of each plate by removing plugs cut with a sterile 6 mm diameter stainless steel biopsy punch. Each plate contained one well of toothpaste–oregano oil mixture, 100 µL of toothpaste–cinnamon oil mixture, and 100 µL of toothpaste–distilled water mixture for the control. A total of 100 µL fluoride toothpaste and 100 µL of distilled water were also tested with three replicates on two different plates. The process was carried out in triplicate for the herbal toothpastes with oregano oil or cinnamon oil.</p>
