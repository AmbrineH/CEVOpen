 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Natural products obtained from medicinal plants are the basis of a large number of active biological components that can lead to the development of new chemicals for medicines. The antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activity of herbal products has found its way into dentistry. Some studies have examined the effects of plant extracts and plant products on specific oral pathogens and other researchers focused on the inhibition of biofilm formation, reducing the microbial adhesion that is primarily responsible for dental plaque formation [

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Plant extracts, essential oils, and phytochemicals have been explored in terms of their ability to prevent or cure bacterial adhesion [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Essential oils can be used due to their antibacterial activities against several bacteria [

These bactericide or bacteriostatic effects of essential oils can be explained by their components, such as terpenes and terpenoids, which are all characterized by a low molecular weight, and aromatic and aliphatic constituents [
