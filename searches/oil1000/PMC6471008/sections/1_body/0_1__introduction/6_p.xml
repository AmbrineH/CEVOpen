<p class="p">There are some studies in the literature comparing fluoride-containing toothpastes and herbal toothpastes [
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Due to their antimicrobial effects, essential oils may be used to prevent dental caries. There are studies in the literature about the effect of essential oil-containing mouthrinses and mouthwashes against different oral bacteria [
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. There is only one study that examined the effect of the 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic>, evaluating the colour, odour, and general appearance of a test toothpaste containing 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This study aimed to develop a new toothpaste formulation. However, there is no reported study about the anticariogenic effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum dubium</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic>) oils combined with herbal toothpastes. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of various herbal toothpastes against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> before and after adding 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oils obtained from oregano and cinnamon plants.
