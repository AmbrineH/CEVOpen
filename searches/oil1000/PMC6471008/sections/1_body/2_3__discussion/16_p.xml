<p class="p">The herbal toothpastes with added 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oil exhibited larger inhibition zones against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> compared to the herbal toothpastes with the combination of oregano oil. The inhibition zones of Jack N’ Jill toothpaste and Splat Organic were similar in combination with 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oil. However, the Splat Biocalcium and 
 <italic class="italic">C. Cassia</italic> oil combination was found to be less effective against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> compared to these two herbal toothpastes. The data obtained cannot be compared with other studies because there is no study on the antibacterial activities of the tested toothpastes and essential oils in the literature. These findings may not correspond to the actual toothpaste behaviour and clinical potential. An experiment with extracted teeth will provide additional data to support the validity of the toothpaste–essential oil combinations in in vitro conditions. Despite the importance of in vitro studies, long-term, clinical trials show the best scientific results regarding treatments and the true response of treatments should be determined with independent clinical trials.
