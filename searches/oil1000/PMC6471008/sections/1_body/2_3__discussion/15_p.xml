<p class="p">Bhattacharjee evaluated the antibacterial activity of toothpastes with different properties and reported that herbal toothpastes are more effective than fluoride- and triclosan-containing toothpastes [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. According to the comparison of antibacterial activity of the toothpastes tested, Splat Organic and Splat Biocalcium without essential oil addition showed similar diameter inhibition zones to Colgate Total against

 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00020-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This result shows that fluoride is not the only ingredient that causes antimicrobial activity in toothpastes. In this study, particularly oregano oil extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic>, a native plant from the Yeşilırmak region in Cyprus, and the oil extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> were added to the herbal toothpastes to investigate their antimicrobial potential against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans.</italic> Although Splat Organic and Splat Biocalcium without any essential oil addition showed some antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, their efficacy doubled in combination with 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> oil and tripled with 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00020-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Jack N’ Jill toothpaste, which showed no antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, surprisingly gained statistically significant efficacy in combination with 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> oil and 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00020-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). This result may be due to the synergistic interaction of calendula in the content of the toothpaste, with the high concentration of cinnamaldehyde in the added 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oil. According to the results obtained from the “test of between subject effect”—which tested the interactions between the toothpastes, essential oils, and toothpaste–essential oil combinations—there were statistically significant differences among all groups (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> ≥ 80). Although the type of essential oil and the interactions between the toothpastes and the essential oils had higher effects on the results (99% and 98%, respectively), the type of toothpaste had a lesser effect on the results (77%).
