<p class="p">The results of this study are consistent with previous research that reported that the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> is related to its high carvacrol content [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. According to the GC/MS analysis in this study, carvacrol was found to be the major component (88.3%) of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum dubium</italic> oil. Therefore, the antibacterial effect of oregano oil in the present study may be related to the carvacrol that it contains. Previous studies on the antibacterial mechanisms of action of plant essential oils including the 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> essential oil have shown that hydrophobic bioactive compounds may cause cell damage, increase cell membrane permeability, affect ATP production and protein synthesis, cause cellular pH deterioration, and cause cytoplasmic changes [

 <xref rid="B60-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Hence, its use is limited due to its highly volatile character and undesirable organoleptic properties [
 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, the essential oils were not used in their pure form.In scientific studies, essential oils are diluted in ethanol, tween, or DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) [
 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Ethanol has been shown to alter the activity of the material due to its antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B65-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, DMSO was preferred to reduce side effects and allow the oils to dissolve homogeneously in the toothpaste. The safety of the formulations was evaluated through the determination of the DMSO additions that would not affect the antibacterial activity of the materials in the literature [
