<p class="p">The agar-disc diffusion method was preferred to prevent the volatilization and dispersion of oils in the evaluation of essential oils, but this method was not suitable for the evaluation of the toothpaste–oil mixtures. Thus, the agar-well diffusion method was chosen to determine the antibacterial activity of the toothpastes and the toothpaste–oil mixtures. The implementation of the agar-disc diffusion method is also limited in some countries because the discs are very expensive. Magaldi [

Several researchers used this method to evaluate the antibacterial effects of some materials [
