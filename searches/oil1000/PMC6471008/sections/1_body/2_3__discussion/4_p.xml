<p class="p">There are several methods for obtaining essential oils. One of them is the hydrodistillation (HD) method, which is a kind of steam distillation, developed by French Pharmacopoeia, and used in the extraction and quality control of essential oils from dried plants [

The distillation time may vary depending on the plant to be extracted. Although the distillation time is long, a small amount of volatile oil is obtained. However, undesirable compound and oxidation products can be separated from the essential oils [
