<p class="p">Within the limitations of this study, the efficacy of Splat Organic and Splat Biocalcium against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> doubled with 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> and tripled with 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> combination. In addition, Jack Nâ€™ Jill gained antibacterial activity and showed the best effect against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>. Therefore, it can be concluded that there was a statistically significant increase in the antibacterial activity of herbal toothpastes with the addition of essential oils (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oil was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> oil (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Alongside these promising findings, further investigations into toothpastes with added essential oil may lead to improvements in the formulation of toothpastes to optimize their anti-caries activity.
