<p class="p">Dental caries is a multifactorial disease with high counts of cariogenic bacteria. 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> is the most frequently isolated bacteria from human dental plaque and was used in the present study because it is believed to be the major cariogenic microorganism of dental caries. The destruction of superficial tooth structures is caused by acids of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> and the by-products of carbohydrate metabolism [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The reason for the cariogenic potential of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> is due to its virulence factors, mainly adhesion capacity, acidogenicity, and aciduricity.
