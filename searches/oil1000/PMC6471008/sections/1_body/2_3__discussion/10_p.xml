<p class="p">To determine the antibacterial activity of pure essential oils, the agar-disc diffusion method was preferred in this study. The agar-disc diffusion method is a common method for evaluating the antimicrobial activities of plants or their extracts [

There are several methods to determine their antibacterial activity in the literature, such as the minimum inhibitory concentration determination method, two variants of the bioautographic method—the direct variant of the bioautographic method (chromatogram layer) and the indirect variant of bioautographic method (agar diffusion)—and two variants of the agar diffusion method (well and disc) [
 <xref rid="B76-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. As essential oils are highly viscous and have a hydrophobic structure, testing the antimicrobial activity of essential oils is not easy. The other methods have some disadvantages, as they cannot be mixed homogenously and leakage of essential oils may occur from the well into the agar. For these reasons, the agar-disc diffusion method was used in this study.
