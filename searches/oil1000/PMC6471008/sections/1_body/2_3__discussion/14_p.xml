<p class="p">Jack N’ Jill herbal toothpaste does not contain any preservatives and flavours because it is produced for infants, toddlers, and children. According to the producer, it contains 
 <italic class="italic">Calendula officinalis</italic> L. and, in the literature, the antimicrobial activity of this plant was shown in a herbal mouthrinse that contains ethanol [
 <xref rid="B94-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of the mouthrinse may also be explained by the fact that it contains ethanol, a solvent that has antibacterial effects. However, in the present investigation, as Jack N’ Jill toothpaste does not contain any solvent, like ethanol, in its content, it did not show any antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> before the addition of essential oils. Jack N’ Jill toothpaste contains xylitol. Xylitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol in most plants and has been approved for use as a sweetener in the food industry by the US Food and Drug Administration since 1963. Xylitol cannot be fermented by oral microorganisms and has been shown to reduce 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> levels in plaque and saliva and markedly reduce tooth decay. The antibacterial effect of xylitol have been evaluated by various studies [

 <xref rid="B96-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], but the amount added to the materials may change the efficacy. According to a study, it was found that it did not show any antibacterial effect under a certain level [
 <xref rid="B97-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. The reason that Jack N’ Jill toothpaste did not exhibit any antibacterial activity in the present study may be due to its low xylitol content.
