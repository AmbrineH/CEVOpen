<p class="p">The comparison of the pure essential oils demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> oil had a larger inhibition zone (38 mm) than 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> oil (30 mm). The inhibition zone of the pure essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C. cassia</italic> against clinically isolated human 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> was measured as 19 mm in a previous study by Chaudhry and Tariq [
 <xref rid="B77-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. This variation with our results may be due to the differences in the active ingredient ratios of the essential oils.
