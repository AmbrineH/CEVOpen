<p class="p">Due to the cariogenic potential of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, oral hygiene measures are used to reduce its accumulation on oral biofilm. Professional care with tooth brushing methods is capable of reducing caries, gum inflammation, and periodontal disease. When looking at the increase in the prevalence of such oral diseases worldwide, it can be stated that only brushing is not enough to prevent tooth decay. For this reason, chemotherapeutic adjuncts may be added to the routine brushing process [

Although the use of fluoride and triclosan-containing toothpastes has benefits, the excess use of these chemical and synthetic products also has negative effects. On this basis, it is wise to prefer herbal toothpastes rather than toothpastes containing harsh chemicals. It has been reported that herbal toothpastes and plant extracts exhibited significant results to cure various diseases, like gingivitis, gum bleeding, bad breath and dental caries, besides their anti-cancerous properties. However, there are no studies comparing herbal toothpastes with added essential oils and fluoride toothpastes. The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the inhibitory efficacy of three herbal toothpastes against the cariogenic bacteria, 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, before and after adding two essential oils. Colgate Total was used as the positive control group in this study, because it is considered as the gold standard for combating dental caries.
