<p class="p">Oregano is a term that describes several species that contain carvacrol as a main component in their structure [
 <xref rid="B47-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Phytochemical and biological studies of the 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species have proved that it is a rich source of compounds with insecticidal, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and anti-carcinogenic activities [

 <xref rid="B49-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. There have been a number of studies on the antibacterial activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species. Previous studies investigated the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species included 
 <italic class="italic">O. dubium</italic> on different bacterial strains, such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>,

 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species are defined according to the types of phenolic compounds they contain [

 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The main components of oregano oil are carvacrol and thymol. They are monoterpenic phenols and are byosynthesized from γ-terpinene [
 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] through 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-08-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Sivripolou et al. showed in their study that the essential oils obtained from the 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species have antibacterial properties because of their phenolic compounds, such as carvacrol, thymol, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, and γ-terpinene [
