<p class="p">In the past many health benefits have been argued by motivating the strong in vitro antioxidant potential, although the relationship between those data and the redox status measurable in vivo is very weak. Furthermore, this approach ignores other biological effects, that perhaps could be related to compounds which may not be detected by an in vitro assay, but, thanks to a good bioavailability, can activate/deactivate an oxidative-related metabolic pathway or interfere with gene regulation or with other signaling pathways, etc. [
