<p class="p">It is important to specify that “microgreens” in their commercial definition (see also 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-nutrients-11-00421" class="xref">Section 1</xref>) do not include the consumption of radicles, so that they are considered as fresh cut vegetables, and microbiological risks can be managed with the existing technologies and packaging, prior and during commercialization [
