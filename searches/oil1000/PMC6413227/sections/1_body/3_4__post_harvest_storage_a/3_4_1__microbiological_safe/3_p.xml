It can be utilized also as dioxide gas treatment, as demonstrated by studies on mungbean sprouts artificially inoculated by Salmonella which was better controlled than by aqueous chlorine wash in reducing microbiological contamination [
 <xref rid="B206-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. These differences could be attributable to the capability of chlorine dioxide gas to penetrate and inactivate cells that are attached to inaccessible sites and/or are within biofilms on the sprouts surface [

In addition, since chlorine compounds can be inactivated by organic materials present on fresh products and may form various carcinogenic organochlorine compounds, most liquid solutions of organic acids such as lactic, acetic and malic acids have been introduced as alternatives to control pathogenic microorganisms. For example, in soybean sprouts, the application of lactic acid (
