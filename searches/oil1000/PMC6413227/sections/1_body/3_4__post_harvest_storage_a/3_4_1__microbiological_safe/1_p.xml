<p class="p">Microbiological contamination of sprouts can be attributable to many potential pre-harvest and post-harvest sources of contaminants, which include seed material, germination medium and soaking water as well as transport, handling and storage of seedlings. It follows that the production process should be optimized starting from seeds treatments. All the employed strategies to reduce health risks include physical, biological and chemical applications, which are well-detailed and reviewed in Yang et al. [
