<p class="p">In common buckwheat sprouts, Chun and Song [
 <xref rid="B207-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">207</xref>] have evaluated the effects on the microbial quality of the combined treatments with aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), fumaric acid and ultraviolet-C (UV-C). Authors found that 100 ppm aqueous ClO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 0.31% fumaric acid and 1.9 kJ/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> UV-C represented the optimal combination condition providing reductions on the populations of total aerobic bacteria, yeast and mould, and coliform, and also maintaining an acceptable sensory quality. The combinate effect of a sanitizer mixture (100 mg/L aqueous ClO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and 0.3% fumaric acid), UV-C (2 kJ/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and modified atmosphere packaging (air and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> gas) on buckwheat sprouts stored for 8 day at 4 Â°C, also reduced the initial inoculated counts of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium, without affecting color parameters [
