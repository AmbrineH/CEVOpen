<p class="p">Some studies have considered the effect of sprouts addition in the formulation of different products focusing on their technological properties. However, food technologies are not examined in detail here, because beyond the scope of this review. We just mention the rheological and baking properties of wheat flour fortified with fermented/germinated cowpea flour [
 <xref rid="B227-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">227</xref>], the functional properties of wheat flour and the shelf-life of bread supplemented with sprouted wheat [
 <xref rid="B228-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">228</xref>], the higher total sugar content of breads from recipes containing sprouts [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] as well as the higher phenolic content and antioxidant activity of enriched breads with wheat sprout powder [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], the quality characteristics of bakery products following the addition of dried barley sprout powder [
 <xref rid="B229-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">229</xref>], the cooking of germinated brown rice [
 <xref rid="B230-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">230</xref>,
 <xref rid="B231-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">231</xref>], the size and acceptability of tortillas obtained from sprouted wheat flour [
 <xref rid="B232-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">232</xref>,
 <xref rid="B233-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">233</xref>]. Some rheological characteristics such as elasticity, water absorption index and viscosity of doughs supplemented with sprouts derivatives could be negatively affected and imply complications and higher production costs.
