<p class="p">At the very least, the effect of light exposure on quality and phytochemical concentrations of freshly sprouts could be considered, since they are usually displayed under light in grocery stores. Indeed, light exposure could cause detrimental effects on products quality. For example, in radish seedlings (without radicles) light exposure (continues fluorescent light; intensity of about 30 µmol/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s) accelerated quality deterioration and weight loss, while dark storage (intensity of about 0.1 µmol/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s) helped preserve quality, prolong shelf life and maintain higher levels of β-carotene and lutein/zeaxanthin ratio during 16 days of storage. On the other hand, no significant differences in α-tocopherol concentration, total phenolics concentration and antioxidant capacity were observed [
