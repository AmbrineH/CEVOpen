 <xref rid="B213-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">213</xref>]. However, the selection of optimum storage temperature plays a key role, depending on species-specific sensibility to chilling and natural decay rates. For example, Berba and Uchanski [
 <xref rid="B200-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>] investigated on the respiration rates and shelf life of arugula, radish, and red cabbage seedlings (without radicles), observing a higher shelf life, based on visual analysis, in radish than in the other species, either at 4 °C (21 vs. 14 days on average) or at 10 °C (14 vs. 7 days on average) storage temperatures. Anyway, their level of acceptance also in relation to quality traits (biochemical composition) also needs to be considered [
