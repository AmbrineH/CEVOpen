 <xref rid="B220-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>] evaluated the effects of UV- irradiation (10 kJ/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in laminar flow chamber for 1 h), pulsed electric field (50 Hz, 10,000 V pulses for 10 s), hot water dip (50 °C for 2 min) and ethanol vapors (in a glass chamber saturated with ethanol vapors for 1 h) on the quality and storage life of mung bean sprouts. Authors have concluded that both ethanol and hot water dip treatments inhibited decay development on the surface, without affecting color and sensory quality during storage (120 h at 7 ± 1 °C); moreover, hot water dip increased the total soluble solids and acidity of bean sprouts [
