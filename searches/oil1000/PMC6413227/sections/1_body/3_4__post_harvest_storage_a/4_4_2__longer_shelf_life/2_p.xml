<p class="p">Of course, the effect of storage temperatures must be evaluated in combination with the atmospheric composition during packaging and with washing treatments on sprouts before packaging, which synergistically contribute to the shelf life (hurdle technology). For example, modified atmosphere packaging effectively prolongs the seedlings shelf life by decreasing O
