<p class="p">Nowadays consumer lifestyle has shift towards “healthy living and healthier foods”, consequently food demand is more oriented towards diets rich in fruits and vegetables, characterized by high content of bioactive molecules. A particular role is played by ready-to-eat vegetables harvested at the initial and very earliest plant growth stages, which are commonly known as sprouted seeds. The term “sprouted seeds” involves different types of products obtained from seeds, depending on the part of the plant collected and consumed—in particular whether the seed is comprised or removed—and on the growing substrate and environmental conditions during sprouting. For each of these products several ambiguous commercial definitions occur (i.e., microgreens, shoots, babygreens, cress, wheatgrass), widespread even in the scientific literature, and the same term could refer to different types of product.</p>
