<p class="p">Beside malting—which represents a special kind of germination used for the production of alcoholic beverages—cereal seedlings might be consumed in the form of ready-to-eat sprouts or further processed, e.g., dried or roasted [

However, the high accumulations of enzymatic activity under uncontrolled germination conditions may adversely affect the physical properties of dough and the resulting baking performance, making the use of sprouted cereals for baking more challenging [

Indeed, cereals contain water-soluble fiber, oligosaccharides and resistant starch, and thus have been suggested to fulfill the probiotic formulations. At least, wheatgrass is mostly consumed as fresh juice or as tablets, capsules and liquid concentrates [
