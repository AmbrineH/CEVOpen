<p class="p">Basically, it is essential to clarify that: (i) shoots are intended to come from the germination of seeds in water, to produce a green shoot with very young leaves and/or cotyledons—the final product does not include the seed teguments and the root [

 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]; (iii) microgreens is the most common and equivocal market term, it may be referred to as seedlings at fully expanded cotyledon stage [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], or at the first true leaf stage, sold with stem, cotyledons, and first true leaves [

 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In general, wheatgrass refers to shoots of 
 <italic class="italic">Triticum aestivum</italic> Linn. [
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] but it could be extended to other species of 
 <italic class="italic">Triticum</italic> genus as well as to species from 
 <italic class="italic">Poaceae</italic> family, although several authors have utilized specific terms such as “ricegrass” [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and “barleygrass” [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. For this reason, the generic term “cereal grass” could be utilized. In this review we mainly consider sprouted seeds (sprouts and cereal grass) obtained from whole grains of the 
 <italic class="italic">Poaceae</italic> family, including the 
 <italic class="italic">Triticeae</italic> (barley, rye, wheat and triticale), 
 <italic class="italic">Oryzeae</italic> (rice varieties), 
 <italic class="italic">Aveneae</italic> (oats), and 
 <italic class="italic">Andropogoneae</italic> (sorghum and maize), as well as minor grains such as millet [
 <xref rid="B10-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Pseudocereals such as quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat are also considered whole grains, as they are nutritionally similar to the
