 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a four-carbon non-protein amino acid that is produced primarily by the 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-decarboxylation of L-glutamic acid, catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). It acts as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian cortex [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. As far as cereals are concerned, GABA production has been deeply studied in brown rice, although several researchers have observed a variation in GABA content also during germination of wheat and barley [

 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Regardless of species, GABA dramatically increases during sprouting. In brown rice, GABA content in seedlings was enhanced by 2- to 5-fold depending on varieties [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], up to 8- to 12-fold when sprouted for 2 to 4 days at 27 to 35 °C [

 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], supported by the increased GAD activity and reduced glutamate content during germination [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. However, GABA content in cereal seedling is greatly affected by both environmental conditions during sprouting (i.e., temperature or abiotic stress) and grain treatment before germination (i.e,. steeping or soaking).
