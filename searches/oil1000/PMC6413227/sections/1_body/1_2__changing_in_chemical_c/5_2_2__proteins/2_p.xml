<p class="p">It is well known that prolamins content decreases as time of sprouting increases, as observed in triticale, barley, rye, oats [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and wheat [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. On the other hand, several authors have reported an increase in crude proteins in barley [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], waxy wheat [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], brown rice [
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] and oats [
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], as a result of the proteins and amino acids stored in the cereal being decomposed by water absorption, changed into transportable amides, and supplied to the growing parts of the seedlings [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. However, the protein content depends on the balance between protein degradation and protein biosynthesis during germination [
