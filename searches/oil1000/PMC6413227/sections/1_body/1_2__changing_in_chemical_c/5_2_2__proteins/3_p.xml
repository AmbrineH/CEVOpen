 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], significant alterations in free amino acid composition have been observed. In particular, germinated whole grains contain higher quantities of essential amino acids, which take part in protein production in human body. Grain type and germination time have the greatest influence on the amino acid composition. In waxy wheat, the essential amino acids isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine and valine reached maximum levels after 36 h of germination, while other essential amino acids (i.e., threonine and methionine) were highest after 24 and 48 h [
