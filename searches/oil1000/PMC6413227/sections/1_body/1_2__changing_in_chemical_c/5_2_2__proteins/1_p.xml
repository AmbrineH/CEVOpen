<p class="p">Whole grains major storage proteins of most cereals are classified according to their solubility properties into albumins (water-soluble), globulins (salt-soluble), glutelins (alkali-soluble), and prolamins (alcohol-soluble). During grain germination, the storage proteins are hydrolyzed into peptides and amino acids by proteolytic enzymes after 2â€“3 days from imbibition, thereby increasing nutrient bioavailability [
