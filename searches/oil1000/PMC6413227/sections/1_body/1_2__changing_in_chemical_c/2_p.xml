<p class="p">Briefly, during a first phase (Phase I) there is a rapid imbibition of water by the dry seeds until all of the matrices and cell contents are fully hydrated. Then, a second phase (Phase II) involves a limited water uptake (plateau phase) but a strong metabolic reactivation. The increase in water uptake associated with Phase III is associated with cell elongation leading to completion of germination [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Upon imbibition, the quiescent dry seeds rapidly restore their metabolic activity, including remobilization, degradation and accumulation, which imply important biochemical, nutritional and sensorial changes in the edible products [
