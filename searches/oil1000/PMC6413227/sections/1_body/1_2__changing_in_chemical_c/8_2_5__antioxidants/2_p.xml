<p class="p">Phenolic acids in seeds are present in both free and bound fractions, with the latter as the most representative, linked to hydrolyzable tannins, lignins, cellulose and proteins, which are mainly structural components of bran and aleurone [
 <xref rid="B79-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Generally, germination leads to a mild increase of the total polyphenols content, although different contribution from free and bound fractions is observed, depending on species and sprouting conditions [
 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. The free fraction increases and the bound one decreases as sprouting goes on, as observed in 2-day old wheat, grown under controlled conditions [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], as well as in 12-day old seedlings of emmer and einkorn cultivars [
 <xref rid="B83-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Conversely, in waxy wheat the bound fraction content dropped after 12 and 24 h of sprouting and then significantly increased after 36 and 48 h [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]; similar trend was reported for several tetraploid and hexaploid 
 <italic class="italic">Triticum</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B79-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>,

 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>], although sprouts examined in these researches were characterized by different growth stages. Indeed, ferulic and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acids, which greatly contribute to the total bound fraction, are known to be involved in cell wall structure and development [
 <xref rid="B85-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. Conversely, in brown rice both free- and bound- fractions significantly increased over germination time [
 <xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]; this is probably due to the hydrolysis of conjugated phenolic compounds and to contemporaneous de novo biosynthesis in the embryo axis [
 <xref rid="B87-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Tartary buckwheat is naturally rich in flavonoids such as rutin, quercetin and catechin; in 8-day sprouts, high rutin and catechin and lower quercetin concentrations were observed with respect to whole grains [
 <xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Interestingly, oats is unique among cereals containing avenanthramides (AVAs)—i.e., low molecular weight soluble phenolic compounds—which was reported to increase by approximately 20% during germination [
