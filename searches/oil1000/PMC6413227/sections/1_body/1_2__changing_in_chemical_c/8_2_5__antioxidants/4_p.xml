<p class="p">Vitamin C content in grains is generally very low; however, many studies have reported higher vitamin C levels in germinated barley [

 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>], probably due to its de novo synthesis [

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-+
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>- and 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-tocopherols were significantly affected by sprouting and increased by 3.59-fold, 2.33-fold and 2.61-fold, respectively [
 <xref rid="B87-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. A significant higher content of tocopherol was also reported for germinated rice [
