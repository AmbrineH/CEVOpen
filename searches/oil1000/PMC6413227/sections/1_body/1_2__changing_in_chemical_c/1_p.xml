<p class="p">By definition, germination incorporates those events that begin with the uptake of water by the quiescent dry seed and terminate with the elongation of the embryo axis, usually the radicle, which extends to penetrate the structures that surround it [

Therefore, physical and biochemical events underlie this process, i.e., weakening of seed covers, turning on of metabolic activity, activation of gene transcription, relaxation of the embryonic cell walls, and reassembly and biogenesis of organelles [
