<p class="p">As phytate content decreases, bioavailability of phosphorus and minerals increases. Germination induced a decreasing Ca concentration in barley and wheat [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] and an increasing Mg concentration in barley, oats [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], and wheat [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. In corn, the content of the main macro-elements (Na, K, Mg, Ca and P) tended to decrease after 2 days of germination and then to increase up to 6 days; trace minerals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu and Co) showed a clear upward trend over germination time [
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. For these species, an increase in HCl-extractability of both major- and trace- minerals was also observed during sprouting, despite it was greatly affected by cultivar [
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Ca, Fe and Zn extractability increased from 76.9, 18.1 and 65.3% in the whole grain to 90.2, 37.3% and 85.8%, respectively, after 96h of germination in finger millet [
 <xref rid="B76-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Lemmens et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] observed an increase in Zn and Fe bio-accessibility from 15 and 14% in sprouted wheat to 27 and 37% in hydrothermally processed sprouted wheat, respectively.
