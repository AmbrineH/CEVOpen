<p class="p">Phytases are a subfamily of the high-molecular-weight histidine acid phosphatases, involved in the hydrolysis of phytate to myo-inositol and ortho-phosphate, as well as inorganic phosphate. The phytase activity tends to increase during germination; in barley, Sung et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] found a very low phytase activity at the beginning of sprouting which, in the first couple of days, increased to 8-fold. However, the concentration of phytase in whole grains greatly varies among cereal species, with rye having the highest values and oats the lowest ones [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. As a consequence, phytate content diminishes to a different extent during germination (see also [
 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]). Sprouting of brown rice over a period of 12â€“72 h leaded to a reduction of 60% in phytate content [
 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], whereas in 4-day old sorghum seedlings, a degradation of up to 87% of phytate was observed [
