<p class="p">However, trends in sugar profile of sprouted grains mainly depend on species: rice, sorghum, and millet seem to accumulate more maltose than glucose, whilst buckwheat greatly accumulates glucose instead of maltose [

 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. 5-day old buckwheat sprouts showed a glucose to maltose ratio of 3.5:1 at germination temperature of 20 °C [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]; this ratio seemed to be linked to the levels of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-amylase released in cereals during malting [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Differential effects have also been reported in response to germination time, with sucrose as the dominant source of carbohydrate during early wheat germination phase and glucose and maltose during the later stages (3 days post-imbibition) [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]; also in rice, sucrose predominated shortly after imbibition. However, germinated rice seedlings showed high sucrose levels for a long post-imbibition period, glucose content increased more rapidly, and maltose did not appear at a significant level until much later (7 days post-imbibition) [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Sprouted grain tissue also plays a significant role: higher glucose content was located in the endosperm of wheat and rice, compared with sucrose in the scutellum [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, the dynamics in the transport mechanism for uptake of remobilized carbohydrate reserves across the scutellum from the endosperm slightly vary among these two species.
