<p class="p">The effect of germination on dietary fiber content of sprouted grains is often inconsistent and strictly depends on fiber fraction, germination time and genotypes [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In germinated wheat the increase in total dietary fibers seemed appreciable at 196 h of incubation whilst their content within the first 48 h of germination time even decreased [

 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. No significant effects were recorded for barley when sprouted for 72 h [
 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In rice, an increase in total dietary fiber after malting has been observed and could be explained with the formation of new primary cell walls [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Besides the increase in total fiber content, an upward trend has also been recorded for both soluble and insoluble fiber fractions of germinated brown rice varieties, while the ratio soluble vs. insoluble ones varied in response to genotype and processing conditions [
 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Rising in the insoluble fraction during germination has also been observed for oats [
