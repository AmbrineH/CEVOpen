<p class="p">The extent of changes in AXs content during germination has garnered much less attention than

 <xref rid="B45-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] observed a loss of up to 50% of total AXs. On the other hand, the amount of water extractable AXs can be increased during sprouting by the release of soluble AXs previously covalently bound to other cell walls, resulting in altered proportions of total to water extractable AXs [
