<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-oryzanol is the principal component of unsaponificable lipid fraction that, along with tocopherols and tocotrienols, contributes to the nutritive characteristics and health promoting properties associated to rice seedlings [

 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-oryzanol content in rough rice and brown rice increased by 1.13 and 1.20-fold, respectively [

 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-oryzanol from rice seedlings could be further investigated, since its concentration depends on cultivar-specific content in kernels [
