<p class="p">Even in cereals, where starch is the main carbon store in the endosperm, lipids are abundant in the living tissues of whole grains (i.e., embryo, scutellum and aleurone) as oil (triacylglycerols, TAG). The mobilization of TAG from oil bodies requires a coordinated metabolic activity, which is started on with germination, leading to the net conversion of oil to sugars [
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The lipases firstly release the esterified fatty acids (FAs) from TAG. Free fatty acids (FFAs) can then be degraded through the
