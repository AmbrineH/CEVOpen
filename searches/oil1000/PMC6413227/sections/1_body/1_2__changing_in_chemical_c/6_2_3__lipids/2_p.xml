<p class="p">In oats—which is unique among cereals due to its high content in oil as compared to starch and protein concentration—the degradation of oil reserves from the embryo was observed to take place earlier than that of oil reserves in the scutellum [

 <xref rid="B63-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]: the linolenic acid (18:3 n3) content increased, while the amount of cis-18:1 and cis,cis-18:2 FAs decreased. Conversely, after 3 days of germination the FAs more represented in wheat sprouts were palmitic acid, linoleic acid and oleic acid [
