<p class="p">The nutritional value of wheat grains is also influenced by the exposure of the mother plant to biotic stress (i.e., pathogens, weeds) and nutrient shortage. Many studies, focusing on the differences in nutritional values between organic and conventional cereals, have led to contradictory results [

In general, organic products have a lower content of proteins; however, old wheat varieties show a more efficient nutrient use in low-N environments compared to the modern ones, which are strictly dependent on high-level of available N [

Although phenolic compounds accumulate more under biotic stress conditions, and consequently organic crops are often thought to contain more phenolic compounds, the effect of cultivation system on secondary metabolites content is often not significant, also in terms of single phenolic acids [

The influence of different agronomic practices or environmental stresses on secondary metabolites in the field is naturally modified by the effects of other potential co-variables. Under greenhouse conditions, three Chilean landraces of quinoa exposed to two levels of salinity (100 and 300 mM NaCl) starting from 34 days after sowing showed a deep change in the amino acid composition and protein profiles of the main seed storage proteins as well as in the contents of bioactive molecules [
