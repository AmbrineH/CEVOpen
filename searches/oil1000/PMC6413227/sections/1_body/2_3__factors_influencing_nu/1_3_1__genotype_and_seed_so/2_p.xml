<p class="p">As is known, the biochemical composition of whole grains is also conditioned by the environmental condition during crop growth, especially during grain development. Bellato et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>] have investigated on the content of total polyphenols, antiradical activity and 5-n alkylresorcinols of 30 Italian commercial varieties of durum wheat, grown in two different geographical areas located in Central and Southern Italy. Results showed that the contribution of genotype (G) x environment (E) interaction to the total variability was lower than that due to the separate effects (G and E), and E accounted for the highest proportion of the variation. In particular, alkylresorcinols concentration increased in environment with dry conditions during grain filling, while high water availability during grain development was favorable to free phenols accumulation. Environment has been also indicated as the main factor contributing to the total variation in some quality parameters in the case of winter and spring wheat varieties [

 <xref rid="B105-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>] and carotenoid content [
 <xref rid="B106-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>], and contrasting effects on starch quality [
 <xref rid="B107-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. This is generally because dehydration stress shortens the grain filling period.
