<p class="p">The alteration of gas composition during germination has been investigated in several species. In particular, a GABA accumulation in seedlings, in response to hypoxia stress during sprouting, was observed in soybean [

 <xref rid="B157-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>]. Indeed, hypoxia stress is often investigated in combination to acidic culture solutions as germination substrates. The maximum GABA content in sprouted foxtail millet under hypoxia was obtained with a germination temperature of 33 °C, an air flow rate of 1.9 L/min and a pH solution of 5.8, with citrate buffer solution (10 mmol/L) being more effective than acetate one [

In germinated tartary buckwheat the optimization of GABA content was reached through the following germination conditions: culture temperature 31.25 °C, air flow rate 1.04 L/min and pH 4.21 (citric acid buffer—10 mmol/L) [
