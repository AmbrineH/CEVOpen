<p class="p">It is important to highlight that the stressful conditions during sprouting, as well as the pre-sowing grain treatments, may reduce germination percentage and/or dry matter production. It follows that the commercial use of those manipulations of environmental conditions during germination should be appropriately set up for each species, to obtain sprouts characterized by higher nutritive and health promoting values, without or slightly affecting the production levels.</p>
