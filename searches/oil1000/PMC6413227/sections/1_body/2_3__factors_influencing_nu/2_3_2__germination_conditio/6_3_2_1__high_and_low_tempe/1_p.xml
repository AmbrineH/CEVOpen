<p class="p">Few studies investigated on the effects of extreme temperatures applied during germination process on the nutritional quality of sprouted seeds; most of these researches focused on non-gramineous species like for example lentil [

 <xref rid="B124-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>], broccoli [
