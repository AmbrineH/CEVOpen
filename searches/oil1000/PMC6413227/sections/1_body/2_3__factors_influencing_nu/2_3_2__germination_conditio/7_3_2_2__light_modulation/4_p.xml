<p class="p">Supplementary red light enhanced the content of phenolic compounds in seedlings of several gramineous and non-gramineous species [
 <xref rid="B130-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>]. Red LED also increased the content of γ-tocopherol in 15-day old barley sprouts [
 <xref rid="B137-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>], and the total phenolic content [
 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>] and catechin content [
 <xref rid="B139-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>] in buckwheat sprouts. The maximum rutin concentration in buckwheat sprouts was obtained after 4 days from sowing either by red:green:blue (4:1:1) LEDs combination [
 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>] or blue light [
 <xref rid="B139-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>]. Again in buckwheat seedlings, blue light contributed also to the highest total anthocyanin content [
 <xref rid="B141-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. On the other hand, supplementary amber light (595 nm) did not significantly affect phenolic and vitamin C contents in wheat and barley sprouts [
 <xref rid="B132-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>], while supplemental green light caused a significant increase in α-tocopherol in 3-day old wheat seedlings [
 <xref rid="B130-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. The effect of UV-B (&gt;300 nm) irradiation was effective in the production of buckwheat sprouts with increased anthocyanins, rutin and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B142-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>].
