<p class="p">As far as sprout production is concerned, the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) during seeds germination seems to be the most relevant strategy to improve the nutritional quality of seedlings. LEDs are characterized by wavelength specificity and are available in the spectral range from near ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (IR). Thus, light spectra can be obtained through the selection of specific wavelengths, also in combination to each other, to maximize the accumulation of specific compounds [

Supplementary flashing amber light induced an increase by 1.6 and 1.3 times of fructose and glucose content in wheat seedlings, while enhancing the content of glucose and the concentration of xanthophylls cycle pigments (i.e., neoxanthin, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin) in barley [

In seedlings (14-day old) of two rice varieties (purple and green leaf), blue light increased Chl a/b ratio, Chl fluorescence and total proteins in leaves, while the content of anthocyanin in seedling leaves was highest in red + blue LEDs [
