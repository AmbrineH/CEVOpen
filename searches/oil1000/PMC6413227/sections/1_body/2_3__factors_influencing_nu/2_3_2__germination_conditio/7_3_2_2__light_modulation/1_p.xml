<p class="p">Light is one of the main factors affecting plant growth and development. Photoreception systems respond to light intensity and quality as well as to light duration and intermittence, thus determining plant morphogenetic changes, functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus, and trend of metabolic pathways [
