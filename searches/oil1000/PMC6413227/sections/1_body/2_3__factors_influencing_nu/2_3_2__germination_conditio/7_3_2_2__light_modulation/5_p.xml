<p class="p">The time interval of exposure to natural light periods have been investigated in common and tartary buckwheat, obtaining highest vitamin C, rutin and free amino acids contents with increasing natural light periods with respect to growing under complete darkness [
 <xref rid="B143-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>]. However, total phenolic and flavonoid contents were greater in 7 days-old sprouts of buckwheat grown in dark chamber than in 7 days-old sprouts grown in open field under natural environment [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>]. Nevertheless, in the former study the natural light periods were not continuous throughout the sprouting periods, while in the latter the germination conditions were different for other variables (i.e., substrate and temperatures). Moreover, longer growth (14-day old seedlings) under light significantly increased rutin and total flavonoid contents compared to darkness-grown sprouts [
 <xref rid="B145-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>]. This could be explained by the upregulation of some structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis under light, as observed in 2, 4, and 6-day old tartary buckwheat sprouts grown in light/dark environment compared to dark-treated ones [
