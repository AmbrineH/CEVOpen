<p class="p">Biochemical changes during sprouting occur depending on germination conditions as well as on the “seed invigoration” treatments applied to the grains in order to improve the germination and post-germination seedling growth. Seed priming is a pre-sowing treatment during which seeds are hydrated with a solution that allows them to imbibe and go through the first reversible stage of germination but does not allow radicle protrusion through the seed coat [
