<p class="p">Not always pre-sowing treatments induce a greater accumulation of bioactive compounds. During the 24 h soaking period, an increase of total phenolic compounds was observed in brown rice [
 <xref rid="B118-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>] and wheat [
 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. The pH of the soaking solution can affect the enzymatic activities in seeds allowing to enhance or reduce the phytochemical content in sprouted grains. In brown rice the optimal pH for higher GABA content ranged from 3.0 to 5.8 [
 <xref rid="B119-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>], since a lower cytosolic pH stimulates GAD activity [
 <xref rid="B120-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. GABA content of germinated barley grains after steeping in a buffer solution (pH 6.0) was slightly higher than that in water [
