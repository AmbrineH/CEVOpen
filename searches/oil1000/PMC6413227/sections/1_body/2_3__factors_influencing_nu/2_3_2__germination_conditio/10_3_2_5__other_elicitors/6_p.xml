<p class="p">Supplying some biosynthetic precursors, as well as specific phytohormones, during germination may enhance biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Several studies have been conducted on species belonging to Brassicaceae family, applying exogenous elicitors such as methionine, tryptophan, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), either as soaking solution treatment [

 <xref rid="B187-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>], in order to evaluate their effects on glucosinolate and polyphenols. Elicitation with MeJA (0.1 mM MeJA dissolved in 0.25% ethanolâ€”sprayed on sprouts) increased total polyphenols (+54.2%) and flavonoids (+61.5%) just as isoorientin, orientin, rutin, and vitexin by about 18% also in 7-day old buckwheat sprouts [

 <xref rid="B189-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">189</xref>], who observed significant increases in phenolics due to the stimulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway by MeJA treatments. In buckwheat sprouts, phenolics content were also increased by elicitation with tyrosine (+30%) and shikimic acid (+17%) [
