<p class="p">Treatments with pulse electric fields (PEF) could potentially be used to manipulate seed imbibition and germination, resulting in seedlings with different metabolite compositions. Grains of Triticum aestivum L. appropriately hydrated (water content of 45% or greater) and subsequently electrostimulated by PEF (electropriming), significantly increased glutathione levels and the activities of several enzymes associated with antioxidant metabolism in plant cells, in 7-day old seedlings [
