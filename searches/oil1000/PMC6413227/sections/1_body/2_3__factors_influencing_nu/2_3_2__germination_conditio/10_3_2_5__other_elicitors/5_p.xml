<p class="p">Among biotic elicitors, polysaccharides and oligosaccharides application during germination has been widely investigated. In particular, the effect of chitosan has been investigated in several non-gramineous species such as bean [

 <xref rid="B175-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>]. Additionally, yeast polysaccharide (YPS) has been regarded as an efficient biotic elicitor for stimulating secondary metabolite production. In tartary buckwheat, YPS applied during germination (50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/L) stimulated flavonoids production in 10 days-old sprouts [

 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], while significantly increased the levels of ferulic, p-coumaric and syringic acids in broccoli sprouts [

 <xref rid="B183-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>], glucosamine and collagen [
 <xref rid="B184-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">184</xref>] as well as tea tree [
 <xref rid="B175-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>] and Salix daphnoides bark [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] extracts. Moreover, among protein elicitors, fish protein hydrolysates (FPH)—produced from byproduct of fishery industry—seem interesting due to their high content of proline and proline precursors. In particular, FPH solutions (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/L), applied to rice grains during soaking for 24 h at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C), stimulated phenolic contents in ricegrass via proline-linked pentose phosphate and shikimate pathways [
