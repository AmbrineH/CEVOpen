<p class="p">Several other abiotic and biotic elicitors as well as plant hormones have been evaluated as potential factors for improved nutritional quality. In general, literature data refer to different elicitation treatments applied to the same species, also in combination to each other, thus highlighting the species-specific response to elicitors. Treatments applied to non-gramineous species, reported in this section, could be usefully transferred also to gramineous ones, properly modulating the experimental conditions (i.e., concentrations and application time). Moreover, all the reported “pre-harvest” elicitation treatments referred here either as seed priming treatments or germination in water solution contain the elicitors, as well as spraying elicitors solution on cotyledons. Therefore, deeper investigations on standardized and species-specific elicitation protocols are still needed.</p>
