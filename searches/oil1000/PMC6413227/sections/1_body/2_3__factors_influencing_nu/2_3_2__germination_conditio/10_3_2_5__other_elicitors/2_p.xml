 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>] on 8-day old lentil sprouts. The stressful condition, imposed from 2 days after sowing, gave the highest amounts of phenolics in seedling tissues, especially in terms of chlorogenic, ferulic, o-coumaric and salicylic acids, as well as in terms of ability to protect lipids against peroxidation, which approximately raised up 12-fold and 8-fold. In 3-day old quinoa sprouts, treatments with H

Oxidative stress significantly enhanced total polyphenols and flavonoids contents, whilst the phenylpropanoid pathway feedings were effective only in flavonoids accumulation; all the investigated treatments significantly improved antioxidant capacity, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) activities, although to different extents, depending on elicitors combinations [
