<p class="p">The application of artificially produced mineral-rich water for sprouts cultivation did not influence the content and composition of dietary fiber in wheat seedlings, while significantly decreased total dietary fiber and catechin and increased quercetin in tartary buckwheat [

At the same time, trace element water (provided by Shimanishi Kaken Co., at the concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ppm), as spraying treatments (4 h intervals) during germination, did not affect rutin, quercitrin and quercetin contents in buckwheat sprouts (about 5â€“7 cm length), while 300 ppm trace element water induced higher radical scavenging, ion chelating and superoxide anion scavenging activities [

In germinated brown rice, the effects of electrolyzed oxidizing water (pH, 3.0; oxidation reduction potential, 1079.0 mV) were effective in inhibiting microbial growth during germination as well as in enriching GABA content in seedlings by 1.7-fold on average [
