<p class="p">Sub-optimal conditions during germination process can lead to an accumulation of phytochemicals in seedlings due to the activation of secondary metabolism [
 <xref rid="B121-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. Rehydration involves high levels of oxidative stress, so that abiotic stress induced during seed germination can intensify the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could damage the structures of DNA, protein, lipid, and other macromolecules in the seeds. Therefore, ROS scavenging is pivotal for seed germination under stress conditions and comprises non-enzymatic components, mainly linked with overproduction of antioxidants (e.g., phenolics) [
