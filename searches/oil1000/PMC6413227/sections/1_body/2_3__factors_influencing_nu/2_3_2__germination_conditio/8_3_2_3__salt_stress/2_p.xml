<p class="p">In buckwheat sprouts, the amount of phenolic compounds, in particular isoorientin, orientin, rutin, and vitexin, as well as carotenoids increased with NaCl solution treatments (10, 50, 100, and 200 mM), regardless of the growth stage [

In einkorn, an increase in total bound-phenolics fraction, until 50 mM NaCl solution was observed, due to the induction of p-coumaric and trans-ferulic acids in their bound form, while durum wheat coped with salinity by increasing the total free-phenolics and reducing the bound ones [

Also, the total phenolic content, reducing power, superoxide radical scavenging and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances production inhibition were measured in raw and denatured aqueous extracts from sprouts and wheatgrass of einkorn and emmer at increasing salinity levels [
 <xref rid="B150-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. For these genotypes the best compromise between quality traits (increased with increasing salinity levels) and growth (reduced at increasing salinity) was 25â€“50 mM NaCl, i.e., the salinity level which maximized the polyphenol and antioxidant yield [
