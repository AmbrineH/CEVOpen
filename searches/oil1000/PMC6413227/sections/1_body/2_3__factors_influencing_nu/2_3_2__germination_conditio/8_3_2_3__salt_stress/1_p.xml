<p class="p">Salinity causes one of the most important abiotic stresses in plants, especially during the early seedling growth, which is a very salt-sensitive phase. However, to date, little is known about the effect of salinity on the phytochemical accumulation in edible sprouts since the impact of salt stress has been principally evaluated in terms of germination rates and physiology. Studies on grains are limited, so that an accurate analysis of the current literature over this topic needs to include evidences from some non-gramineous species.</p>
