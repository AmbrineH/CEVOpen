<p class="p">Germinated whole grains would be a promising vehicle for food biofortification programs. In brown rice, a recent research by Wei et al. [
 <xref rid="B191-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">191</xref>] has shown the possibility to increase Fe concentration in germinated grains (24 h of sprouting) by soaking kernels in solutions of FeSO

 <xref rid="B192-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">192</xref>], as well as Fe solubility, which was nearly 4-fold higher than in non-fortified sprouts [
 <xref rid="B191-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">191</xref>]. However, the relatively low permeability of some seed coats does not allow obtain fortification with Fe enriched solutions. This was the case for broccoli and radish soaked with Fe(III)-EDTA and Fe(III)-citrate solutions [

Conversely, the same authors observed significantly higher iron concentrations in 5-day old alfalfa sprouts obtained from Fe-soaked seeds. This increase was associated with a significant decrease in Ca, Mg, Na and/or Mn concentrations, due to the leakage during imbibition, and with a significant induction of phenolic compounds concentration [
