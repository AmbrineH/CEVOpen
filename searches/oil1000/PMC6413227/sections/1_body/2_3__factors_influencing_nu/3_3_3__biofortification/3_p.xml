<p class="p">Fortification programs can also be applied during crop cycles, representing a suitable approach to ameliorate the concentration of macro- and micro-elements in whole grains, thus influencing their dynamics during the subsequent germination process. Foliar Zn fertilization, applied over panicle initiation and grain filling stages, represents an effective agronomic practice to promote rice grains Zn concentration, especially when supplied as Zn-amino acid and ZnSO
