<p class="p">Plant seeds are able to accumulate Se and to transform it from inorganic to organic form (i.e., Se-containing proteins) during germination. In this way, Se-biofortification during sprouting could represent a valid strategy to improve Se concentration in seedlings [

 <xref rid="B194-nutrients-11-00421" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>]. In brown rice, both total Se and protein-bound Se contents in seedlings significantly increased with increasing external selenite concentration (up to 60 μmol/L Na
