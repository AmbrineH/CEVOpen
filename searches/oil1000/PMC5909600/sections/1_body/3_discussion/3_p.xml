<p class="p">Both breast meat and abdominal fat are edible parts of the chicken body. Information on the effects of FAs on human health is extensive [

 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown that dietary FAs strongly influence the tissue FA composition [

 <xref rid="pone.0196035.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. As expected, the FA profiles in the breast meat and abdominal fat reflected the FA composition of the fat supplement. The effect of rapeseed oil, which is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, on the content of unsaturated FAs in the breast meat was more pronounced than that of lard and palm oil. The concentrations of linoleic and arachidonic acids were highly correlated (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.908; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting a significant conversion of linoleic acid by Î”6-desaturase. This result also suggests a significant activity of FA elongase because the addition of two carbons was also necessary.
