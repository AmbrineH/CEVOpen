 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196035.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> presents data on the relative mRNA expression of six hepatic genes related to lipid metabolism measured as RQ (2
 <sup class="sup">-ΔΔCT</sup>). The relative expression of carnitine-palmitoyltransferase was low in chickens fed diets supplemented with lard and high in chickens fed rapeseed or palm oil. The highest relative expression of HMG-CoA reductase was observed in chickens fed palm oil, while this expression was similar in chickens fed rapeseed oil or lard. Rapeseed oil reduced the expression of FA synthase. The three fat sources differed in their effects on the relative expression of desaturase genes. The highest expression of all desaturases was observed in chickens fed palm oil. All fat sources reduced the expression of Δ9-desaturase in comparison with that in the control.
