<p class="p">Based on traditional
 <italic class="italic"> quilombola</italic> medicinal use information, formulations containing
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> essential oils were developed and evaluated for their antinociceptive and sedative activities. The final concentration of essential oil in the formulations (0.1â€‰g/mL) was established based on the amount of
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> used in burning and inhalation by
 <italic class="italic"> quilombolas</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] as well as the mean yield of essential oil in the
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> samples [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Although the traditional mode of use of
 <italic class="italic"> breu</italic> by the
 <italic class="italic"> quilombola</italic> communities involves burning and subsequent inhalation of the smoke produced, the chamber developed for this study does not foresee this procedure.
