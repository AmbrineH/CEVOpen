<p class="p">Intraplantar administration of formalin produces nociception, which is characterized by two distinct phases [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The early phase (neurogenic phase) occurs in the first five minutes and is associated with direct chemical stimulus of the afferent fibers, mainly C-fibers [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], with activation of TRPA1 channels [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], and reflects centrally mediated pain. The late phase (inflammatory phase) occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after formalin injection and is mediated by the release of a combination of inflammatory mediators and sensitization of central nociceptive neurons [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. It is well-known that centrally acting drugs, such as opioids, inhibit nociception in both phases, while peripheral-acting drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid, inhibit only the second phase [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In addition, the activity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also observed in the second phase [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>].
