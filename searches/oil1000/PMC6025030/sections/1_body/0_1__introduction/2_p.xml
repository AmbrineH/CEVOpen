<p class="p">Electrospinning is an electro-hydrodynamic process that allows the extrusion of polymer fibres by the application of an electric force [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. By adjusting the operational parameters and the rheological properties of the material to be spun, fibres with desired size, chemistry and surface properties (fibres decorated with pores, papillae or knots) can be produced. It has been demonstrated that electrospun mats containing essential oils, such as cinnamon [

 <xref rid="B13-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], are promising as advanced wound dressings and smart food packaging systems. Rieger et al. have demonstrated the electrospinning of cinnamon EO in a chitosan matrix, obtaining nanofibres with an inactivation rate higher than 70% for bacteria responsible for skin infections (

 <xref rid="B9-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. T. Uyar and collaborators have proposed nanofibres that incorporate cyclodextrin inclusions (CD-ICs) of volatile compounds from essential oils, such as linalool and thymol, for their antibacterial efficiency against

 <xref rid="B11-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In vivo studies on mice showed that the nanofibrous dressings promoted wound closure and enhanced granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization of the injured tissue. Those and other studies have established that EOs impart bioactivity to electrospun fibres by making them, for example, effective for the treatment of bacterial colonisation and skin inflammations, and for the inhibition of oxidative processes [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, the effects of EOs on the morphology of electrospun mats have not yet been investigated.
