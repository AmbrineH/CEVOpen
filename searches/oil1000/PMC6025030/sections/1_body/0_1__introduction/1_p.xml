 <xref rid="B4-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In recent years, the encapsulation of essential oils into polymeric nanofibres produced by electrospinning has gained increasing interests, because of the possibility of achieving a longer and more controlled release of those bioactive agents if compared with other delivery methods [
