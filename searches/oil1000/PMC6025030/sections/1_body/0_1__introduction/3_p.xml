<p class="p">Here, the role played by the chemical composition of clary sage and black pepper essential oils on the topography of electrospun poly(lactic acid) fibres is discussed. Particular attention is given to phase separation phenomena happening during the electrospinning process as a consequence of the evaporation of the most volatile components of EOs and their poor miscibility with the polymer. Morphological investigations of the electrospun mats are combined with chemical and thermal analysis of the essential oils, in order to identify the chemicals mainly responsible for the structural changes observed. Antibacterial tests using two model microorganisms confirm that the ability of both clary sage and black pepper EOs to inhibit bacteria growth is not affected by the electrospinning process.</p>
