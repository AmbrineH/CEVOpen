<p class="p">The investigations conducted have demonstrated that the complex chemical composition of essential oils can be used to control the morphology of electrospun PLA mats, and nano-textured fibres can be produced by selecting oils rich in volatile compounds, like black pepper EO. Despite the evaporation of some chemical constituents of EOs during electrospinning, both the oils retained their antibacterial activity, as demonstrated by antibacterial tests on two model microorganisms: 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00923-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a, after 24 h of incubation at 30 Â°C, a high number of colony-forming units (CFU) of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> were found for PLA fibrous mats without any essential oils. On the contrary, a limited number of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> colonies and no colonies of 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> (clear agar gel plate) were detected for PLA/CS-EO mats. No growth of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> was visible (clear agar gel plates) for PLA/BP-EO fibres. The calculated loss of bacteria viability confirmed that neat PLA mats did not possess antibacterial properties, with inactivation activity of 0% for both microorganisms. Instead, PLA/CS-EO mats were characterised by inactivation activity of 76% for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 100% for 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> (

 <italic class="italic">.</italic> PLA/BP-EO fibres were highly effective against both bacteria with viability losses of 100%. The limited inactivation efficiency of clary sage EO against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> can be explained by taking into consideration that Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>) are less susceptible to the action of essential oils than Gram-positive ones (
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>). The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is characterized by an outer membrane that is formed by diverse proteins and lipopolysaccharides [

 <xref rid="B42-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The structure of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, instead, allows hydrophobic molecules to diffuse inside the cells and affect the action of enzymes and proteins. They can cause disruption of the cell wall with leakage of ions, reduction of membrane potential, depletion of proton gradient and disruption of adenosine triphosphate, eventually resulting in the death of the microorganism [
