The formation of junctions between fibres and the inter-fibre bonding was attributed to the low glass transition temperature of the composite fibres and to the chemical composition of clary sage EO (as it will be discussed later) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00923-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>d). Each single PLA/BP-EO fibre was covered with pores elongated along the main axis of the fibre, which is the direction of polymer stretching during the electrospinning process. An average of (17 ± 3) pores per μm
