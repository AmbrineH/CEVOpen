<p class="p">By considering the Hansen solubility parameters of the chemicals used in this study, only acetone could be regarded as a good solvent for PLA (

The other compounds (clary sage EO, black pepper EO, linalyl acetate, α-pinene, limonene and β-caryophyllene) were instead non-solvents for PLA. The insolubility of the polymer in the essential oils, together with the diverse evaporation rates of the chemicals constituting the EOs, affected the morphology of the PLA/CS-EO and PLA/BP-EO fibres produced. Fibres electrospun from PLA acetone solutions containing 10%

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00923-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b). The surface was either slightly wrinkled (PLA/linalyl acetate) or smooth (PLA/β-caryophillene), and fusion occurred. This morphology can be explained taking into account that, during electrospinning, the rapid evaporation of acetone and the insolubility of PLA in linalyl acetate or β-caryophillene caused thermally- and non-solvent induced phase separation, respectively. Polymer-rich and polymer-lean domains were formed but the slow evaporation of the non-solvents, due to their low vapour pressure, resulted in the fibres being not completely solid when they reached the collector [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Consequently, the fibres fused and connected to one another. The effect of the glass transition temperature of the composite fibres was negligible in this case, because
