<p class="p">The chemical compounds identified as main constituents of clary sage and black pepper EOs possess different evaporation rates, which predominantly governed the morphology observed for PLA/CS-EO and PLA/BP-EO fibres [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00923-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a show that CS-EO had a linear evaporation profile, with a mass loss of circa 40% after 1200 min. A similar linear behaviour was reported for linalyl acetate but with a weight loss of 90% after 1200 min (vapour pressure of 0.005 mmHg at 20 °C). Instead, BP-EO exhibited a two-stage mass loss profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00923-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b): 50% weight was lost in the first 200 min; whereas a mass loss of circa 15% was recorded in the remaining 1000 min. The immediate evaporation of BP-EO was correlated to the presence of volatile components. Both α-pinene and limonene evaporated completely in less than 200 min (vapour pressure of 4.5 and 3.3 mmHg at 20 °C, respectively). On the contrary, 70% of β-caryophyllene was still present after 1200 min (0.003 mmHg at 20 °C, respectively).
