 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-00923-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>d), with well-defined and elongated pores uniformly distributed onto their surface. Here, the proposed mechanism of pore formation still includes phase separation events due to rapid evaporation of acetone and non-solubility of PLA in α-pinene and limonene. However, for those mats, the evaporation of the non-solvents transformed the polymer-lean regions in surface pores and significantly increased the concentration of polymer in the ejected filaments [

 <xref rid="B40-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The restrained mobility of the polymer chains in the polymer-lean phase prevented the pores from closure. In addition, the stretching of the polymer jet by the electric force caused the elongation of the nano-features.
