<p class="p">Since linalyl acetate is the main constituent of clary sage EO, it can be assumed that it played a crucial role in defining the morphology of the PLA/CS-EO mats. For PLA/BP-EO fibres, instead, α-pinene and limonene contributed to the surface porosity much more than β-caryophillene, probably due to their abundance in BP-EO.</p>
