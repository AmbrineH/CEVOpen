<p class="p">According to the TGA data, it is expected that, during the electrospinning process, BP-EO will evaporate more quickly than CS-EO, resulting in the formation of highly porous fibres. Studies in the literature have demonstrated that porosity can be generated onto polymer fibres by phase separation phenomena during electrospinning, which are associated with the use of high vapour pressure solvents [

 <xref rid="B38-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Two mechanisms of phase separation are possible during fibresâ€™ spinning: thermally and non-solvent induced phase separation. In the first situation, the fast evaporation of the solvent determines a temperature reduction of the ejected solution, resulting in polymer-rich and polymer-lean regions. After the complete evaporation of the solvent, the polymer-lean domains will originate pores onto the surface of the fibre. Thermodynamic instabilities can also be induced by the addition of a non-solvent to the polymer solution, leading to the formation of polymer-rich and solvent-rich regions.
