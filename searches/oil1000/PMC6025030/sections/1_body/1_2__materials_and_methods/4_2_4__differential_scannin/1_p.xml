<p class="p">The glass transition temperature (
 <italic class="italic">T
  <sub class="sub">g</sub>
 </italic>) of the electrospun mats was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, TA Instruments Calorimetric Analyser, Elstree, UK) in the temperature range between −20 °C and 100 °C. The samples (5 mg) were tested at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min in three scans: heating, cooling and heating. The onset point of the temperature step change of each sample from the second heating run was obtained as glass transition temperature.
