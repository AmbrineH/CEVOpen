<p class="p">The antibacterial properties of the electrospun mats were tested against two model microorganisms, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> using AATCC Test method 100–2004 (viability loss) [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. First, 2 bottles of LB broth solution (2.5 g LB broth powder was dissolved in 100 mL water) and 300 mL molten LB agar (1.2 g LB agar powder was dissolved in 300 mL water) were prepared and sterilized in autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min. After the temperature of the LB broth solution dropped to room temperature, single bacteria culture of each test strain was transferred to the prepared LB broth using sterilized inoculating loops. The bacteria culture in the broth solution was grown overnight at 37 °C in a rotary shaker (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). The broth solutions with 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> bacterial cells were then diluted to 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/mL and 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL by sterilized Ringer’s solution, respectively. The molten LB agar was poured into petri dishes and left at room temperature for 30 min to set. 20 mg of electrospun fibrous mats (PLA, PLA/CS-EO and PLA/BP-EO mats) were cut into small pieces and placed at the bottom of glass jars. The jars were filled with 1.5 mL of bacteria dilution (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> dilutions) in order to completely cover the electrospun samples. The jars were thoroughly shaken. Next, 30 μL of liquid containing bacteria were taken from the jars, spread onto the freshly prepared agar plates and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h (“0 h contact time” samples). The jars with the remaining bacterial dilutions and the electrospun fibres were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. After 24 h, 30 μL of the bacterial solution were spread onto the agar plates and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h (“24 h contact time” samples). The colony-forming units (CFU) were counted for “0 h contact time” and “24 h contact time” samples. The loss of bacteria viability was calculated according to:
