<p class="p">The morphology of the electrospun fibres was analysed by Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEGSEM, LEO 1530VP, LEO Elektronenmikroskopie GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany). Prior to observation, the fibrous mats were cut into small pieces (0.3 cm Ã— 0.3 cm), stuck on aluminium stubs by carbon adhesive tapes and then coated using a palladium/gold sputter coater for 90 s (Emitech SC7640 Sputter Coater, Polaron, Laughton, United Kingdom) to produce a conductive surface. The average diameter of the fibres was determined by processing the FEGSEM images using ImageJ (Version 1.52c, National Institute of Heath, Bethesda, MD, USA). Up to 60 fibres were analysed for each type of sample.</p>
