<p class="p">For the electrospinning process, a 1 mL syringe with a 23G needle was filled with the polymer solutions prepared (PLA/acetone or PLA/acetone/EOs) and connected to a syringe pump (New Era Pump System, NE-300, New York, NY, USA). The flow rate was set at 0.7 mL/h. The needle was clamped to the positive electrode of a high voltage power supply (S1500032-0, Linari Engineering s.r.l., Pisa, Italy), generating a voltage of 12 kV, while the ground electrode was connected to an aluminium collector (air gap distance of 15 cm). All experiments were conducted in normal environmental conditions.</p>
