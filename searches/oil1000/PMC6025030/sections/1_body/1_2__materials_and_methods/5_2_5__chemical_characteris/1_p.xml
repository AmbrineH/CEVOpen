<p class="p">The chemical composition of clary sage and black pepper essential oil was characterised by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS, Varian, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The essential oils were diluted 25 times with ethyl acetate and analysed using a Hewlett Packard mass detector and a HP-5MS column (length 30 m, inner diameter 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The injector, GC-MS interphase, ion source and selective mass detector temperature were maintained at 250, 280, 250 and 150 °C. The oven temperature for both oils was programmed as follows: 60 °C (1 min), 60–185 °C (1.5 °C/min), 185 °C (1 min), 185–275 °C (9 °C/min), 275 °C (2 min). Split injection was performed with helium as carrier gas, with a flow rate of 1.1602 mL/min. The split ratio of the column was fixed at 40:1. The pressure of the column was set at 9.4 psi. The components were identified by comparing the mass spectra obtained with mass spectra of standards obtained with the same column.</p>
