<p class="p">Previous studies have established that essential oils impart antibacterial, anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant properties to electrospun fibres. In this work, medicinal essential oils are used not only to induce bioactivity in electrospun fibres but also to control their structure and surface morphology. Essential oils of clary sage and black pepper have been selected, combined with PLA and processed by electrospinning. The inclusion of essential oils resulted in changes in the chemical, thermal and surface properties of the electrospun fibres, as demonstrated by FT-IR, DSC and SEM investigations. It was demonstrated that during the electrospinning of ternary blends of PLA/acetone/non-solvents (CS-EO, BP-EO and their main components), thermodynamic instabilities and phase separation events were generated with the consequent formation of fibres characterised by wrinkled surfaces or nano-pores. The resulting composite fibres, which also exhibited antibacterial properties, have potential biomedical applications as dressings that are able to prevent bacteria colonisation of wounds and promote skin regeneration. Particularly, the nano-topography created on the surface of the PLA/BP-EO fibres is attractive to the development of scaffolds that provide both physical and chemical cues for skin repair.</p>
