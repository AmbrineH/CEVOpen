<p class="p">Hence, in the present study, the hydrodistillation method was proved to be better than maceration method for this novel herb. The hydrodistillation method for 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> has been found to affect the quantity and quality of the essential oil obtained.[

 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] that when compared to other techniques, the quantity of the essential oil and its phytochemicals may contain higher concentration of active components. This could be the reason for the difference where essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> from hydrodistillation process showed better efficacy than extracts from maceration among 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species.
