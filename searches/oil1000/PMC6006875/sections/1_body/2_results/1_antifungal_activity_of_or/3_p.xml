<p class="p">None of the extracts from maceration technique showed zone of inhibition equivalent to zone of inhibition obtained through essential oil from hydrodistillation method (&gt;30 mm). However, ethanol extract was the nearest and was efficient against only two species of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>, that is, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, (10 mm) and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> (14 mm). Ether (8 mm) and chloroform (10 mm) were effective only against 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic>. n-butanol and methanol extracts were not effective against any 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp.
