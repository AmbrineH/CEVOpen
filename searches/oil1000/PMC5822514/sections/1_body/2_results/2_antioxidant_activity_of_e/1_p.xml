<p class="p">Employing the DPPH method, the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. macrostema</italic> showed antioxidant activity from 0.1 mg/mL, with 12.43% of free radical-scavenging [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 1a</xref>] and 25.95% by ABTS method [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 1b</xref>]. The highest antioxidant activities (53.1%) were obtained with 1 mg/mL by DPPH method [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 1a</xref>], 92.12% with the ABTS method [1 mg/mL, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 1b</xref>], and 98% of TAC with 0.1 mg/mL [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 1c</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">S. macrostema</italic> by DPPH method was higher than BHT and similar with ABTS method. The essential oil showed an antioxidant activity more efficient than ascorbic acid with TAC assay [
