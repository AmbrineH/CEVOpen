<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">S. macrostema</italic>, demonstrated by the three methods of free radical scavenging used in the present research, was attributed to the high content of terpenes. The most powerful scavenging constituent by DPPH and ABTS was found to be thymol showing 94.07% and 99.52% of activity, respectively, percentages of antioxidant activity higher than BHT (30.39% and 97.23%, respectively) at 1 mg/mL. Thymol and limonene shown the higher antioxidant activity determined by TAC method with 98.57% and 98.74%, respectively, percentages higher than ascorbic acid (62.43%) at 0.1 mg/mL.
