<p class="p">We demonstrate the use of amphiphilic poly(2-oxazoline)s to stabilize perfluorocarbon-in-water and oil-in-water nanoemulsions. The living nature of the polymerization allows for the controlled addition of functionalizable comonomers into the hydrophilic block of the polymers to facilitate covalent emulsion functionalization. Through incorporation of these functional handles, the ability to attach azide-modified dyes and neutral or charged thiols to the surface of the droplets was achieved. We prepared a set of equal-size yet differentially charged nanoemulsions, which were employed to explore the dependence of cellular uptake on zeta potential in both macrophage and non-macrophage cell lines. We found that cationic emulsions were preferentially uptaken in both cell types. Overall levels of uptake were lower with poly(2-oxazoline) amphiphiles than poloxamers, making the surfactants and emulsions reported herein promising scaffolds for biomedical applications. The use of this surfactant platform to enable controlled delivery in response to biologically relevant stimuli is ongoing. Additionally, the ability to modify the surface of nanoemulsions should extend these materials to areas of nanotechnology where control over chemical and physical properties is a prerequisite.</p>
