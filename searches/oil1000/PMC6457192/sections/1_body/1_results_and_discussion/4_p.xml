<p class="p">Surfactants that could be further functionalized were synthesized by incorporating alkene and alkyne functionality into the hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) block of POx amphiphile 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold>. Alkene and alkyne functionalities were chosen due to their ability to undergo thiol–ene and CuAAC “click” chemistries, respectively. These classes of reactions benefit from their high efficiency, modularity, and water compatibility—all desirable characteristics for the proposed post-emulsion modification route.

 <bold class="bold">15</bold>) to methyl-2-oxazoline (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>, 15 mol% alkene/alkyne) with methyl triflate. Once all monomer was consumed, nonyl-2-oxazoline (
 <bold class="bold">4</bold>) was introduced to the reaction mixture to form the hydrophobic block (

 <bold class="bold">14</bold> or 
 <bold class="bold">15</bold> may be statistically incorporated into the poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) chain.
