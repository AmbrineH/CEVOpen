<p class="p">We first synthesized a small library of amphiphilic diblock and triblock poly(2-oxazoline) amphiphiles and explored their ability to stabilize oil-in-water and perfluorocarbon-in-water nanoemulsions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The polymer surfactants were designed to mimic Pluronic F-68 (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>), with poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) replacing poly(ethylene oxide) and either poly(2-propyl-2-oxazoline), poly(2-nonyl-2-oxazoline), or poly(2-(perfluorohexyl)ethyl-2-oxazoline)
 <xref rid="cit81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref> replacing the hydrophobic poly(propylene oxide). The POx surfactants were synthesized through a controlled, living cationic ring-opening polymerization of corresponding 2-substituted-2-oxazoline monomers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>, 
 <bold class="bold">2–5</bold>). Due to the controlled nature of the polymerization mechanism, block lengths were tuned by initiator to monomer ratio.
 <xref rid="cit74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref> Hydrophilic blocks were kept at 30 repeat units of 2-methyl-2-oxazoline (
 <bold class="bold">2</bold>), while hydrophobic blocks (composed of 
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">4</bold> or 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>) were kept at 10 repeat units. Block lengths were chosen at a ratio analogous to 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>, with shorter lengths to speed surfactant migration to the interface.
 <xref rid="cit64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref> Microwave-assisted polymerization allowed for short reaction times and low dispersities (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) compared to traditional solution phase synthesis.
 <xref rid="cit84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref> Polymerizations were quenched with acrylic acid to aid determination of number average molecular weight (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and characterized them to have
