<p class="p">We then assayed the viability of A375 and RAW cells treated with the different POx emulsions as well as a Pluronic F-68 control over a 12 hour incubation period at a surfactant concentration of 7.0 mg mL

Conversely, cationic emulsions displayed significant macrophage toxicity (58% ± 1.4% viability) and less pronounced, though significant, loss of viability in A375 cells (87% ± 2.3% viability). Interestingly, the unfunctionalized POx stabilized PFC nanoemulsions resulted in substantially larger viability loss in RAW cells than the emulsions that underwent surface modification with neutral thiol 
 <bold class="bold">23</bold> (61% ± 0.6% and 79% ± 3.9% viability, respectively). Collectively, our results demonstrate that a post-emulsion functionalization approach is essential for tuning the cellular uptake and viability of these diverse, yet underdeveloped, soft nanomaterials.
