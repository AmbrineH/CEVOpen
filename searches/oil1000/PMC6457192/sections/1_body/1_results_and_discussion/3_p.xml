<p class="p">To test the ability for POx amphiphiles to stabilize nanoemulsions, polymers 
 <bold class="bold">6–11</bold> were first solubilized in dimethylformamide and then diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to a final surfactant loading of 2.8 wt%. This solution was combined with 10 vol% fluorous or hydrocarbon oil. Emulsions were formulated through ultrasonication for 15 minutes at 0 °C. For the fluorous solvent, we selected a 7 : 3 (v/v%) mixture of perfluorodecalin : perfluorotripropylamine (PFD : PFTPA, 
 <bold class="bold">12</bold> : 
 <bold class="bold">13</bold>) due to its use in Fluosol-DA, a previously FDA-approved PFC nanoemulsion stabilized by Pluronic F-68 (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>).
 <xref rid="cit95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref> Dynamic light scattering analysis of POx-stabilized PFC nanoemulsions showed size distributions that were comparable to or smaller than droplets stabilized by 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), with polydispersities ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 (Fig. S1–S6
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">†</xref>). Monitoring the size over 60 days at ambient temperature indicated that propyl-2-oxazoline-containing surfactants (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>) were inferior, exhibiting significant Ostwald ripening (&gt;300% change in size, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>), despite structural analogy to 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>. The more hydrophobic nonyl-2-oxazoline-containing surfactants (
 <bold class="bold">8</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">9</bold>) were superior to the propyl-containing surfactants with diblock 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold> performing better than triblock 
 <bold class="bold">9</bold>. Surfactants with fluorous components (
 <bold class="bold">10</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">11</bold>) displayed the best stability over time, on par with 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>. Emulsions stabilized by triblock copolymers 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">9</bold>, and 
 <bold class="bold">11</bold> resulted in smaller initial size distributions, but increased in swelling over time compared to diblock copolymers 
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold>. When employed for olive oil emulsion formation, 
 <bold class="bold">6–9</bold> resulted in sub-250 nm droplets (Fig. S10–S15
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">†</xref>). As expected, the fluorous copolymers 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">11</bold> were not effective surfactants for the formation of oil-in-water nanoemulsions. After 3 weeks, oil droplets stabilized by propyl-2-oxazoline-containing surfactants (
 <bold class="bold">6</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>) underwent phase separation. In contrast, emulsions stabilized by nonyl-2-oxazoline-containing surfactants (
 <bold class="bold">8</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">9</bold>) showed no size change (Fig. S15
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">†</xref>). These data demonstrate that the following results on PFC nanoemulsions can be extended to more conventional oil-in-water nanoemulsions. Our initial library of poly(2-oxazoline) surfactants resulted in amphiphilic copolymers that performed similarly to 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> yet could be prepared through a controlled living polymerization. Diblock copolymers 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold> stood out as the most promising, as 
 <bold class="bold">8</bold> formed emulsions of small size for both oil-in-water and PFC nanoemulsions, while 
 <bold class="bold">10</bold> formed PFC emulsions with good stability. Work toward expanding this library to elucidate the role of the surfactant's hydrophilic–lipophilic balance, block length and structure on emulsion size and stability are underway. Here, we focus on the creation of POx surfactants that allow for modification of the emulsion surface, such that size and surface charge can be decoupled.
