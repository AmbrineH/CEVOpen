<p class="p">Using the thiol–ene post-emulsification strategy, we can modulate the zeta potential of the droplets from +35 to –35 mV at pH 7.4 while keeping the size constant (Fig. S28
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">†</xref>). Notably, it is difficult to obtain emulsions with identical sizes but varied surface charges, as ionic surfactants stabilize interfacial tensions differently compared to non-ionic surfactants.
 <xref rid="cit37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref> We demonstrated that the pre-emulsion functionalization of the surfactants yielded distinct nanoemulsions when compared to post-emulsion modification. Polymers were prepared by reacting 
 <bold class="bold">16</bold> with thiols 
 <bold class="bold">18</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">23</bold>, or 
 <bold class="bold">24</bold>. After isolation, these surfactants were subjected to standard PFC nanoemulsion formation conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5A</xref>). We then compared the size and surface charge of emulsions resulting from the pre- or post-emulsification approach to emulsions stabilized by unmodified surfactant 
 <bold class="bold">16</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5B</xref>). As expected, there was no statistically significant difference in size for emulsions modified with neutral thiol 
 <bold class="bold">23</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5B</xref>, yellow). In contrast, differences were observed in the size of anionic and cationic emulsions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5B</xref>, red and blue, respectively). Overall, emulsions formed through a pre-emulsification method varied in size by up to 35 nm, while post-emulsion modification resulted in nanoemulsions with only a 5 nm variance. These results showcase that post-emulsion surface functionalization is a viable approach to decouple the zeta potential of nanoemulsions from their size.
