<p class="p">Next, we evaluated the ability of poly(2-oxazoline)s 
 <bold class="bold">6–11</bold> to act as surfactants for nanoemulsions. Poly(2-oxazoline)s have been thoroughly investigated for micellization

 <xref rid="cit83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref> and have previously been employed for chloroform-in-water macroemulsions,
 <xref rid="cit86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref> yet their use as surfactants for nanoemulsion formation is novel.
 <xref rid="cit89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref> Our main interest lies in perfluorocarbon-in-water nanoemulsions,
 <xref rid="cit90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref> as the orthogonality of the fluorous phase provides opportunities to selectively sequester fluorous-tagged payloads inside the droplets.
 <xref rid="cit94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref> Historically, perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions have been stabilized by Pluronic F-68 (
 <bold class="bold">1</bold>) for use as artificial blood substitutes;
 <xref rid="cit95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref> however, these surfactants have been associated with formulation inconsistencies and multidose toxicity.
 <xref rid="cit96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>–
 <xref rid="cit98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref> Contemporary applications of PFC nanoemulsions such as

 <xref rid="cit99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref> ultrasound contrast agents,
 <xref rid="cit45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref> photodynamic therapy,
 <xref rid="cit92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref> and intracellular sensors
 <xref rid="cit103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref> have spawned interest in new formulations. We previously looked to commercially available polymers and biomolecules for the stabilization and surface functionalization of PFC emulsions, but found these materials unsuitable due to large size and rapid degradation of the droplets, as well as limitations in post-emulsion functionalization.
 <xref rid="cit90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref> Recently, volatile perfluorocarbon droplets have been effectively stabilized by Gianneschi and coworkers through triblock poly(norbornene)s,
 <xref rid="cit45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref> and by Medina 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> through crosslinked peptides.
 <xref rid="cit44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref> However, neither of these efforts explored surface modification. Taken together, these works suggest interest and need for custom polymer surfactants that facilitate functionalizable, stable PFC nanoemulsions.
