<p class="p">Alongside verification that Cu-catalyzed click chemistry was successful at the nanoemulsion surface using a rhodamine dye, we validated that the thiol–ene reaction was a viable approach for post-emulsion modification by modulating the surface charge of the droplets. Changes in surface charge could be quantified by zeta potential analysis, which did not require a purification step. PFC nanoemulsions stabilized by

 <bold class="bold">23</bold>), mercaptoacetic acid (
 <bold class="bold">18</bold>), or 2-dimethylaminoethanethiol (
 <bold class="bold">24</bold>), which will have different protonation states at physiological pH. These solutions were irradiated with 365 nm light overnight and the zeta potential of the samples were measured (
