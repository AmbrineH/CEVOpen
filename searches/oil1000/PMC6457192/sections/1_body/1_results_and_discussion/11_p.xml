<p class="p">When the series of differentially charged nanoemulsions were incubated with the RAW macrophage cell line, the preference for cationic particles fell to 20% over the neutral emulsions and 60% over the anionic emulsions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6D</xref>). In addition, the overall uptake of nanoemulsions in RAW cells was about four-fold greater than A375 cells. Macrophage uptake appears to be particularly nanomaterial dependent as contrasting trends are apparent in the literature.

 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">†</xref>), and size of these samples are similar, yet POx-stabilized emulsions display lower uptake than Pluronic F68-stabilized emulsions in both cell lines. These results suggest that the poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) surface coverage reduces the non-specific uptake of the emulsions as compared to poly(ethylene oxide). Low levels of non-specific uptake are essential for the active-targeting of nanoparticles.
