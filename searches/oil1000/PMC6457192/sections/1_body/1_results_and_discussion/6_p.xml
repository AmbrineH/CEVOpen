<p class="p">Nanoemulsions prepared from 
 <bold class="bold">17</bold> that contained alkynes on the surface were fluorescently modified by treatment with azidorhodamine 
 <bold class="bold">22</bold> (3.0 equiv.), cupric sulfate (0.5 equiv.) and sodium ascorbate (0.3 equiv.) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4C</xref>). As a control, an emulsion stabilized by the corresponding non-functionalized surfactant (
 <bold class="bold">8</bold>) was exposed to identical conditions. Emulsion sizes were monitored before and after the reaction to confirm that the reagents did not disrupt nanoemulsion stability (Fig. S17 and S18
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">†</xref>). The rhodamine absorption of the emulsion solutions exposed to CuAAC conditions was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy before and after dialysis of the samples to confirm removal of non-conjugated dye. An increased shoulder on the emulsions with conjugated alkyne suggested aggregation of the fluorophores due to high local concentration on the surface of the droplets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4D</xref>, red lines). Covalent modification of the surface of the droplets was confirmed after dialysis purification as the alkyne-containing emulsions retain absorption from the rhodamine while the control emulsions were no longer colored (

 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR of surfactant isolated post-reaction further confirmed quantitative consumption of the alkyne chemical handles (Fig. S19 and S20
