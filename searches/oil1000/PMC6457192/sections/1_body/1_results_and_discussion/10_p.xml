<p class="p">We assayed the cellular uptake of PFC nanoemulsions in both macrophage and non-macrophage cell lines by loading a fluorous-soluble rhodamine dye (

 <xref rid="cit91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref> into the emulsion core. The resulting fluorescent nanoemulsions were incubated with A375 (human melanoma, non-macrophage) or RAW (macrophage) cell lines for 3 hours and, after washing, their degree of fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6C and D</xref>). We performed these studies on emulsions formed from 
 <bold class="bold">16</bold> either unmodified or functionalized with 
 <bold class="bold">18</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">23</bold>, or 
 <bold class="bold">24</bold>. We also employed emulsions stabilized with 
 <bold class="bold">1</bold> as a control. These experiments showed that cationic nanoemulsions were uptaken in the A375 non-macrophage cell line 250% more than the neutral emulsions and 370% more than the anionic emulsions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6C</xref>). This preference for cationic particles is consistent with other nanomaterial uptake studies.

 <bold class="bold">23</bold> resulted in cellular uptake levels similar to that of unmodified 
 <bold class="bold">16</bold>, indicating that discrepancies in cellular uptake are due to differences in the physicochemical properties of the nanoemulsions, and not a result of the chemical modification process.
