<p class="p">A scenario where both the size and charge of particles directly influence function is cellular uptake. Controlling cell–nanoparticle interactions is essential for advancements in nanomedicine. Previous work has explored the relationship between size, charge, and cellular uptake by modulating the surface chemistry of gold nanoparticles,

The custom surfactants reported herein allowed us to extend the scope of cellular uptake studies to include nanoemulsions. Through decoupling of size and surface charge, we find that macrophage and non-macrophage cells display charge-dependent cellular uptake.
