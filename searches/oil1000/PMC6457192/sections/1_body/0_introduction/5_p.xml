<p class="p">Herein, we report a panel of POx surfactants for the stabilization and functionalization of nanoemulsions, kinetically stabilized emulsions less than 500 nm in size.
 <xref rid="cit75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref> We showcase the controlled living polymerization of POx to incorporate comonomers into the hydrophilic block of the surfactants to facilitate post-emulsion functionalization. We find that thiol–ene and copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistries are successful at the liquid–liquid interface, overcoming a key obstacle in emulsion functionalization.
 <xref rid="cit11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref> We demonstrate that these chemistries can decouple emulsion properties by altering the charge of similarly-sized droplets.
