<p class="p">The role of the surfactant in stabilizing droplets has largely precluded the ability to engineer emulsion surfaces, particularly for nanoemulsions, whose interface composition is dictated by the need to impart kinetic stability. Conventional emulsion surface functionalization techniques involve modification of the surfactant prior to emulsification.

 <xref rid="cit51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref> The functionalized surfactant can be employed solely or in combination with other surfactants. Limitations to this approach are the reliance on cosurfactants
 <xref rid="cit52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref> and the inability to decouple size and surface charge. An alternative approach is the introduction of a functionalized amphiphile after emulsification that can absorb on the surface.

 <xref rid="cit35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref> Other post-emulsification strategies rely on reversible chemical interactions with the surfactant at the liquid–liquid interface. Reported approaches involve electrostatic deposition,

 <xref rid="cit59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref> These techniques are all environment-dependent, limiting their generalizability. Irreversible covalent modification of macroemulsion surfaces have previously been enabled by end-group functionalization of commercially available surfactants.

 <xref rid="cit61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref> Notably, these approaches suffer from low occupancy of functional groups on the droplet surface and did not allow access to droplet sizes relevant for biomedical applications (&lt;200 nm).
 <xref rid="cit62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref> Comparatively, nanoemulsion interfaces have much higher surface areas and provide a more challenging interface to both stabilize and functionalize, as exemplified by previous low-yield attempts reliant on cosurfactants.
 <xref rid="cit59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref> To enable robust, covalent modification of nanoemulsions, we devised a versatile, top-down approach involving custom surfactants with chemical handles that undergo covalent modification at the liquid–liquid interface.
