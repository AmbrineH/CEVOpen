 <xref rid="cit64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref> We hypothesized that chemical handles could be incorporated into the hydrophilic block without destabilizing the droplets. A popular class of polymer surfactants are poloxamers: block copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) (

Additionally, poly(ethylene oxide)-containing amphiphiles, like many surfactants employed for pharmaceutical emulsion formulations,
