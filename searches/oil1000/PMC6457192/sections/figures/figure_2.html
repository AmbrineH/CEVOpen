 <p> (A) Library of amphiphilic di- and triblock copolymers 6–11 and (B/C) their utility as surfactants for PFC nanoemulsions composed of 7 : 3 v/v% perfluorodecalin (PFD, 12) : perfluorotripropylamine (PFTPA, 13). (B) Initial size distributions of POx-stabilized emulsions. Emulsions were prepared by sonicating a solution of 2.8 wt% surfactant with 10 vol% 7 : 3 PFD : PFTPA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Emulsions were diluted 1 : 100 in MilliQ water prior to measurements by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Data represents the average of three independent samples; error bars represent the half-width at half-maximum averaged over the three independent samples. (C) Ostwald ripening of emulsions over 60 days monitored by LS, see Fig. S7–S9 † for raw data. Error bars represent the standard deviation of percent size changes for three independent samples. </p>
