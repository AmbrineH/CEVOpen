 <p> (A) Schematic of post-emulsion modification strategy with surfactants 16 and 17. (B) Dynamic light scattering data of emulsions formed from 8, 16, 17. Emulsions were prepared with 10 vol% 7 : 3 PFD/PFTPA and 2.8 wt% surfactant in PBS, diluted 1 : 100 in MilliQ water and analyzed via DLS. (C) CuAAC chemistry is employed for emulsion surface functionalization with azidorhodamine dye 22 (NaAsc = sodium ascorbate). (D) Emulsions formed from 8 and 17 were subjected to the CuAAC chemistry conditions in (C). After 12 h, the reaction mixtures were diluted 1 : 100 in MilliQ water and their absorbance was measured (pre-dialysis, solid lines; red = 17, blue = 8). The remaining solution was dialyzed in water for 24 h with 3 water changes, at which point the emulsion solution was removed and analyzed by UV/Vis at the approximate concentration as the previous measurements (post-dialysis, dotted lines; red = 17, blue = 8). All the data were normalized to emulsion 8 pre-dialysis. See Fig. S17 † for size analysis before and after reaction and dialysis. (E) Thiol–ene chemistry allows for modulation of zeta potential with thiols methyl mercaptoacetate ( 23), mercaptoacetic acid ( 18), and 2-dimethylaminoethanethiol ( 24). (F) Zeta potential of the emulsions at pH 7.4 before ( 16) and after thiol–ene modification following the conditions in (E). Black = emulsions stabilized by 16; yellow = emulsions stabilized by 16 and modified by 23; red = emulsions stabilized by 16 and modified by 18; blue = emulsions stabilized by 16 and modified by 24. The surface charge was analyzed by diluting the reaction mixtures 1 : 100 in MilliQ H 2O and measuring the zeta potential. Data is representative of five replicate measurements. Error bars represent the standard deviation of five measurements. See Fig. S21 † for raw zeta potential traces. </p>
