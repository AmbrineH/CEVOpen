 <p> (A) Surfactants dictate the size, charge, and surface chemistry of emulsions. Emulsion cores can be composed of several liquid phases ( e.g. oil, perfluorocarbon). Payloads can be solubilized in the emulsion core and functional groups can be appended on the surface. (B) Selected surfactants for emulsion formation, including poly(2-oxazoline) surfactants presented herein. </p>
