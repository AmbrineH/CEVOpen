 <p> (A) Schematic of emulsions modified through post- (top) or pre- (bottom) emulsion modification methods. (B) Thiol–ene chemistries were performed on surfactant 16 with thiols 18, 23 or 24 either before (conditions in Fig. 3B) or after emulsification (conditions in Fig. 4E). The emulsions were diluted 1 : 100 in MilliQ water and analyzed by DLS. Plotted are the size changes as determined by the absolute difference between size distributions of the resulting emulsions and control emulsions formulated with unmodified 16. Size data is representative of the average of three independent samples, with three replicate measurements; error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent samples. See Fig. S29 † for emulsion size distributions and statistical significance. </p>
