Emulsions were prepared by sonicating a solution of 2.8 wt% surfactant with 10 vol% 7 : 3 PFD : PFTPA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Emulsions were diluted 1 : 100 in MilliQ water prior to measurements by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Data represents the average of three independent samples; error bars represent the half-width at half-maximum averaged over the three independent samples. (C) Ostwald ripening of emulsions over 60 days monitored by LS, see Fig. S7–S9
   <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" class="xref">†</xref> for raw data. Error bars represent the standard deviation of percent size changes for three independent samples.
