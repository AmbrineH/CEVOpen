  <title class="title">(A) Schematic of emulsions modified through post- (top) or pre- (bottom) emulsion modification methods. (B) Thiol–ene chemistries were performed on surfactant 
   <bold class="bold">16</bold> with thiols 
   <bold class="bold">18</bold>, 
   <bold class="bold">23</bold> or 
   <bold class="bold">24</bold> either before (conditions in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>) or after emulsification (conditions in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4E</xref>). The emulsions were diluted 1 : 100 in MilliQ water and analyzed by DLS. Plotted are the size changes as determined by the absolute difference between size distributions of the resulting emulsions and control emulsions formulated with unmodified 
   <bold class="bold">16</bold>. Size data is representative of the average of three independent samples, with three replicate measurements; error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent samples. See Fig. S29
