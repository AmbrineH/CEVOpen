<p class="p">Cisplatin is clinically proven as a potent treatment for various types of cancers, including sarcomas, testicular cancers, and cancers of soft tissue, lung, bones, muscles, and blood vessels. Unfortunately, clinical use of cisplatin is limited because it accumulates in renal tubules, causing acute kidney injury and, thus, harming normal tissues (Arany and Safirstein, 
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Recent studies on the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced toxicity have revealed that cisplatin is the most frequent cause of nephrotoxicity when administered in higher doses. However, nephrotoxicity is multifactorial and involves numerous signaling pathways. Cisplatin act as oxidant stress promotes apoptosis of proximal tubule renal cells through mitochondrial dependent and independent pathways
