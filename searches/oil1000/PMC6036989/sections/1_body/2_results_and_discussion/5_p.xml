<p class="p">As previously mentioned, the predominant bioactive compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> are thymoquinone (30-48%), thymohydroquinone, dithymoquinone, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, carvacrol, Î±-pinene, thymol, quercetin, kaempferol, and quercetin-3. 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> also contains phytochemicals such as fixed and volatile oils, proteins, flavonoids, glycosides, alkaloids (mainly magnoflorine), and saponins that have strong antioxidant properties and palliative effects on inflammation (Ahmad

The observed decrease of Na, Na/K and vitamin D levels in the cisplatininduced renal toxicity PC group may be due to suppressed renal tubular reabsorption of water and electrolytes into the blood stream. Black cumin and thymoquinone synergizes the nephroprotective effect against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and methotrexate induced nephrotoxcity in rats (Benhelima 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Treatment with NSE increased electrolyte excretion, having and a greater natriuretic effect than a kaluretic effect and a similar uricosuric effect with the control. The Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>/K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> ratio can be used to predict the diuretic mechanism due to an increase of the kaliuretic effect, but mostly to a decrease of Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> excretion (Toma 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). This may be attributed to the antioxidant activity of the extracts. Polyphenols and flavonoids have been reported to be effective in reducing the oxidative stress from cisplatin, thus restoring kidney function (Kaur
