<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="table004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the PC group exhibited a significant increase in renal tissue levels of MDA and significant decrease of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, SOD, and GPX) when compared to the NC group. Administration of NSP, NSO and NSE caused significant decreases of MDA and increases of enzymes with antioxidant activity compared to the PC group however did not cause full recovery of these enzymes. Cisplatin generates free radicals such as superoxide and hydroxyl which produce oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation (Santos

 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Cisplatin induced renal toxicity decreases levels of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic molecules as glutathionein and significantly increases hepatic MDA levels in rats (Kart

NSO and NSE have anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase and contains kaempferol and quercetin which have strong antioxidant properties (Mahmoud 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2002; Entok 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thus, NSP, NSO, and NSE prevents cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity via direct antioxidant activity and indirect antioxidant activity from induction of endogenous antioxidant enzymes.
