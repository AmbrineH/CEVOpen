<p class="p">Serum urea and creatinine levels are indicators of acute tubular necrosis caused by cisplatin toxicity andnephrotoxicity. The PC group, which was treated with cisplatin alone, exhibited a significant increase in serum levels of urea, uric acid, and creatinine as compared to the NC group (
 <xref rid="table003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Treatment with NSP, NSE and NSO reduced the cisplatin-induced increase of urea, uric acid, and creatinine. Nigella oil and extract were especially effective at reducing the increase observed in the PC groups, but were not able to cause full recovery of normal (NC) urea, uric acid, and creatinine levels. In agreement with previous reports, initial cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction was caused by the inhibition of carnitine synthesis and reabsorption. Cisplatin further causes damage by accumulating in renal parenchymal cells and biotransforming into cysteinyl glycine conjugates and other high thiols via localized enzymes (Yao

 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Compared to the NC, the PC exhibited a significant reduction of total serum protein and globulin and an increase of albumin and A/G ratio levels. Treatment with NSP reduced levels of total protein and globulin, but there were no significant changes in albumin and A/G ratio. In contrast, treatment with NSO significantly reduced total serum protein, albumin, globulin, and the A/G ratio. Finally, NSE exhibited protein levels similar to the NC. Total protein and albumin measurements may reflect nutritional status and can be used to screen and diagnose kidney disease or liver disease. The NSO group had a significant reduction in total serum protein, albumin, globulin and A/G ratio, however the NSE group exhibited protein levels similar to the NC. Cisplatin binds to cytoplasmic proteins, disrupting their normal physiological function which leads to oxidative damage and cytotoxicity. Administration of NSP and NSO significantly reduced levels of albumin and A/G ratios and increased of globulin as compared to the PC (Karasawa

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The NSO and NSE treatment groups both exhibited nephroprotective effects via lower serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and antioxidant activity as compared to gentamicin control group values (Canayakin

 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The cisplatin-induced renal toxicity PC group exhibited a significant decrease of Na, Na/K and vitamin D levels as compared to the NC group. All three NSP, NSO and NSE treatment groups exhibited significant increases of Na, Na/K, and vitamin D and significant decreases of potassium levels compared to the PC in the same table.
