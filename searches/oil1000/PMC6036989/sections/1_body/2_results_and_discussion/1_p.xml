 <xref rid="table001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> showed that NSP contain high amount of carbohydrate, protein and fiber and low amount of fiber, fat and ash. Our results were somewhat in agreement with the values reported by Nergiz and Ötleş (
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). The obtained mineral content of NSP indicated major differences in the amounts of calcium, iron, sodium and potassium compared to results by Nergiz and Ötleş (
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>) who reported 188±1.5, 57.5±0.5, 85.3±16.07 and 1180±10.0, respectively. Lower levels of potassium, iron, and sodium and higher levels of calcium 
 <italic class="italic">were estimated</italic> in NSP as compared to Nergiz and Ötleş (
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). However, El-Tahir and Bakeet, (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) observed the presence of 0.5-1% calcium, 0.6% phosphorus, 0.6% potassium, and 0.1% sodium in NSP. The difference in observed NSP composition is likely related to different crop varieties, regional environmental conditions, growing techniques, and fertilizer application. From these results, 
 <italic class="italic">NSP have</italic> high carbohydrate, protein, calcium, and potassium content. The predominant fatty acids were linoleic, oleic, myristic, and palmitic acids, as the estimated percent values were 55.88±4.27, 23.89±2.57, 18.05±1.02, 10.95±1.82, and 3.90±0.41, respectively. There were also trace amounts of arachidic, linolenic and palmitoleic acids (0.30% ±0.04, 0.25% ±0.03, and 0.1% ±0.01, respectively). NSO had a higher percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (81.50% ±1.96) than saturated fatty acids (16.11% ±2.35). 
 <italic class="italic">Similar fatty</italic> acid values were reported by Nickavar 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, (
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) and Atta (2006). The fixed oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella</italic> seeds is rich in linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids. The dominating fatty acid is linoleic acid, which is an essential fatty acid and accounts for more than 50% of total fatty acids in NSO. Linoleic and oleic acids represented the pre-dominant unsaturated fatty acids and represented more than 80% of the total fatty acids. There was a high linoleic/oleic acid ratio, so Nigella oil should not be used in frying. Also, Bourgou 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>reported that linoleic acid was the major fatty acid (58.09%) in NSO, and was followed by oleic acid (19.21%) and palmitic acid (14.77%). Differences in Nigella seed oil fatty acid composition between studies are likely due to various factors, such as genetic variation and different oil processing methods.
