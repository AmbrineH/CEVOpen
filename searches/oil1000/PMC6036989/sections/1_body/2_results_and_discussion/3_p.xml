<p class="p">Previous studies have shown that cisplatin is highly emetogenic, as it has been widely utilized to induce acute nausea and vomiting in preclinical animal models. The increase of nutritional markers in rat groups administrated 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic>is likey due to it nutrient content and not due to its antioxidant properties (Takruri and Dameh, 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> seed powder is a good counteractive agent against the emetogenic effects of cisplatin because it is typically used as a digestive, appetite stimulant, and supplement to supportimmune system function. 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> seeds contain many important phenolics, such as kaempferol, p-coumaroyl acid derivative, and thymol-O-sophoroside. 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> seed extract has significant anti-inflammatory potential because of its antioxidant activity (Kadamand Lele,

 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> likely due to its ability to scavenge free radicals and inhibit lipid peroxidation (Heshmati

 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic>. When combined with polyphenols, compounds that facilitate lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, thymoquinone induces weight loss in diabetic rats (Kaur
