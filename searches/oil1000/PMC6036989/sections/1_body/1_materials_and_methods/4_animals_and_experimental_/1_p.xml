<p class="p">The experiment was performed with a total of 50 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 165Â±10 g. Rats were provided from an experimental animal center in Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh. Rats were housed with a 12h dark/light cycle schedule, placed as groups in wire cages under normal laboratory conditions, and fed a standard diet during a one-week adaption period. Rats were given free access to water and standard diet. Ethical guidelines were maintained during animal handling and permission was obtained from the concerned Department. After one week of acclimatization, rats were divided into 5 subgroups (n=10). The negative control (NC) group was given a single I/P injection of saline. The other treatment groups were injected with a single I/P dose (8 mg/kg body weight) of cisplatin (1 mg/mL) dissolved in saline to induce nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity in rats was confirmed by observing elevated creatinine, urea nitrogen, and uric acid. The nephrotoxic rats were then divided into four subgroups: a positive control (PC) group that was administered distilled water; the NSP treatment group that was administered 3 g/kg/day of nigella sativa powder; the NSO treatment group that received 2 g/kg/day of nigella sativa oil; and the NCE group which was administered 0.5 g/kg/day of nigella sativa extract. All treatments given to nephrotoxic rats were administered daily via stomach tube for 60 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose of the experiment, rats were sacrificed to obtain blood and kidney samples.</p>
