 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> seeds were purchased from a local herbal shop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The seeds (250 g) were cleaned, dried in a hot air oven, and mechanically grinded to obtain 
 <italic class="italic">Nigella sativa</italic> powder (NSP). One hundred grams of NSP was extracted three times with 300 mL of 96% ethanol. The extracts were filtered, and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary, resulting in a blackish-brown liquid concentrate of NSE as expected (Hadjzadeh
