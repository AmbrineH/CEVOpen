<p class="p">As has been appreciated, many pure components present in the tested EOs have exhibited some level of antileishmanial activity. In fact, it is known that the compounds present in the EOs can act synergistically in mixtures, increasing the intrinsic effects of the purified components. Therefore, we suggest the potential use of EOs as mixtures. In addition, we have also taken into account that the tested EOs are commercially available in their present forms, reducing the cost of a therapeutic alternative, which constitutes one of main drawbacks of current antileishmanial treatments. The notable antileishmanial effects and moderate cytotoxicities in the case of mixtures of compounds could be further explored in animal models of cutaneous leishmaniasis by intralesional or topical routes.</p>
