<p class="p">Interestingly, wintergreen (
 <italic class="italic">Gualtheria fragrantissima</italic>) essential oil, which was dominated by methyl salicylate (99.7%), showed antileishmanial activity against both 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 20.7 μg/mL) and amastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 22.2 μg/mL). 
 <italic class="italic">Betula lenta</italic> (birch bark) essential oil (99.9% methyl salicylate) was somewhat less active against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 32.2 μg/mL). Considering the abundance of methyl salicylate in both wintergreen and birch essential oils, this compound is likely the active component.
