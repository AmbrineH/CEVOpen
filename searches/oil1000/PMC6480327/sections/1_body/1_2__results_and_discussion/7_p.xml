<p class="p">Copaiba oils (not hydrodistilled essential oils) from several different species of 
 <italic class="italic">Copaifera</italic> were screened by Santos and collaborators against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Antileishmanial activities against the promastigotes ranged from 5.0 to 22.0 μg/mL. Consistent with these results, copaiba oil in this study (50% β-caryophyllene) showed an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 17.2 μg/mL. The copaiba essential oil, however, was also too cytotoxic (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 23.3 μg/mL) to warrant further consideration. On the other hand, β-caryophyllene was found to be remarkably active against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> amastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.3 μg/mL) but less toxic to murine macrophages (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 63.6 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In contrast, antipromastigote activity of β-caryophyllene on 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> was reported to have an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 19 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. β-Caryophyllene was also found to show excellent antileishmanial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. major</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.06 and 1.33 μg/mL, respectively), with less cytotoxicity against Raw 264.7 mouse macrophage cells [
