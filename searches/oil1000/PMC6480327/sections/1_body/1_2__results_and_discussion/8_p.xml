<p class="p">Rosemary (
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.) essential oil from Colombia (composition not reported) showed activity against

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Similarly, rosemary essential oil from Tunisia (43.8% 1,8-cineole, 12.0% camphor, 11.5% α-pinene, 8.6% β-pinene, 4.8% camphene) was active against 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 16.3 μg/mL) and

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 20.9 μg/mL) promastigotes [

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 282 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In this present study, commercial rosemary essential oil (45.9% 1,8-cineole, 12.0% α-pinene, 10.9% camphor, 6.3% β-pinene) was only marginally antileishmanial (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 89.7 μg/mL), but also marginally cytotoxic (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 83.4 μg/mL). Rosemary essential oils have shown great variation in composition with at least five different chemotypes, which likely result in different biological activities [
