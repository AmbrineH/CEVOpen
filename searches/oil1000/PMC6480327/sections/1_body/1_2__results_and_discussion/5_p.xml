 <italic class="italic">C. sativum</italic>. Commercial coriander essential oil used in this study was obtained from dōTERRA International and the major components were linalool (73.5%), α-pinene (5.3%), and γ-terpinene (4.5%). A linalool-rich (73.2%) coriander essential oil was screened by Rondon and co-workers against 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania chagasi</italic> and was shown to be very effective against amastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 1.51 μg/mL), but much less active against the promastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 181 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that linalool might be the compound responsible for the antileishmanial activity. Indeed, Rosa and co-workers have shown linalool to be very active against both promastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.0043 μg/mL) and amastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.0155 μg/mL) of 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, the presence of linalool does not necessarily translate to a good antileishmanial profile. Pettitgrain (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus aurantium</italic> L.) leaf essential oil (25.4% linalool), lavender (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill.) essential oil (34.4% linalool), and basil (
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic> L.) essential oil (55.7% linalool), were only marginally active against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 56.9, 70.7, and &gt;200 μg/mL, respectively). There may be other components in these essential oils attenuating the antileishmanial activity of linalool.
