<p class="p">Another essential oil rich in α-pinene was cypress (
 <italic class="italic">Cupressus sempervirens</italic> L.) with 49.7% α-pinene. Cypress essential oil gave an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 40.0 μg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes, but was too cytotoxic (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 27.2 μg/mL) against mouse peritoneal macrophages to be considered for further evaluation. Other major components in cypress essential oil were δ-3-carene (27.0%) and terpinolene (4.2%). Juniper (
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus communis</italic> L.) berry essential oil was also dominated by α-pinene (34.9%), with lesser quantities of myrcene (11.9%), sabinene (11.4%), β-pinene (7.9%), and terpinen-4-ol (4.5%). Juniper berry essential oil showed good activity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 27.4 μg/mL) and reduced cytotoxicity against mouse peritoneal macrophages (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 103.0 μg/mL). Thus, the presence of α-pinene seems to impart antileishmanial activity, but the activity is apparently enhanced or attenuated by other components in the essential oil.
