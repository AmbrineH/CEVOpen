<p class="p">A total of 52 commercially-available essential oils were screened for in-vitro antileishmanial activity against the promastigote form of 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic>, as well as for cytotoxic activity against mouse peritoneal macrophages, the host cells for the amastigote form of the parasite. The antileishmanial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01248-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Of the essential oils tested, three showed notable antileishmanial activity and selectivity, frankincense oil (from the oleogum resin of 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> spp.), coriander oil (from the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Coriandrum sativum</italic> L.), and wintergreen oil (from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Gualtheria fragrantissima</italic> Wall.). These three products were also active against the intracellular amastigote form of
