<p class="p">This study has shown that the essential oils of frankincense, coriander, wintergreen, and birch have notable antiparasitic activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania amazonensis</italic> with an acceptable SI with respect to cytotoxicity against mouse peritoneal macrophages. However, essential oils are complex mixtures of compounds, and the biological activities cannot necessarily be attributed to individual components; there are apparent synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions as well. Nevertheless, essential oils containing appreciable concentrations of Î±-pinene, linalool, or methyl salicylate should be investigated for antiparasitic activity.
