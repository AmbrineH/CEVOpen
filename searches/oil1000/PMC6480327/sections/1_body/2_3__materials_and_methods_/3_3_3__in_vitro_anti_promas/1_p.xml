<p class="p">Screening against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes was carried out as previously described [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Into each well in a 96-well plate, 50 μL medium (Schneider’s medium + HFBS + antibiotics) was added. Into the wells of column 2 and 7, 48 μL medium + 2 μL sample (dimethylsulfoxide solutions of essential oil, 20 mg/mL) were added. Five two-fold serial dilutions were carried out down each column to give final test concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL. Exponentially growing parasites (4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>) in medium were added to each well. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) served as the negative control and pentamidine (Richet, Buenos Aires, Argentina) was used as a positive control. The plates were sealed with Parafilm
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> and incubated at 26 °C for 72 h. Afterward, 20 μL of a solution (5 mg/mL) of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well. The plates were incubated for an additional 4 h, the supernatant was removed, and the formazan crystals were dissolved with 100 μL DMSO. The absorbance of each well was determined with a plate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) with a test wavelength of 560 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm from which median inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) were calculated [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were determined from linear dose-response curves fit to the data using a linear equation model. Each test was carried out in triplicate, and the results expressed as means ± standard deviations (SD).
