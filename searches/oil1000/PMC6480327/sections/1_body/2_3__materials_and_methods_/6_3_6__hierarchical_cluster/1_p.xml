<p class="p">The chemical compositions of the commercial essential oils along with the antileishmanial and cytotoxic activities were used in an agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis. The essential oil compositions of the 52 commercially-available essential oils and the bioactivities were used to determine the associations between the essential oils and their activities using XLSTAT Premium, version 2018.5.53172 (Addinsoft, Paris, France). Dissimilarity was determined using Euclidean distance, and clustering was defined using Wardâ€™s method.</p>
