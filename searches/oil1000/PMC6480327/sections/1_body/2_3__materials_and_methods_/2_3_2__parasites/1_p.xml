 <italic class="italic">Leishmania amazonensis</italic> parasites (Reference strain MHOM/77/BR/LTB0016) were kindly provided by the Department of Immunology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Brazil. The parasites were routinely isolated from mouse lesions (BALB/c mice) and maintained as promastigotes at 26 °C in Schneider’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HFBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 100 U of penicillin and 100 μg streptomycin per mL as antibiotics. Parasite cultures were passaged every 3–4 days, but no longer used after the tenth passage after isolation from mice.
