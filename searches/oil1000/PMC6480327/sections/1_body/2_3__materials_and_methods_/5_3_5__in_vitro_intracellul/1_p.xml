<p class="p">Median inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of the active essential oils on 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> amastigotes were carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The peritoneal macrophages, obtained from BALB/c mice (as above), were seeded in 24-well culture plates at 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere for 2 h. Non-adherent cells were removed, and stationary-phase 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes were added (4:1 promastigote/macrophage ratio), and incubation continued for an additional 4 h. Free parasites were removed and 1000 μL RPMI completed medium was added to each well. Into the first well, 990 μL medium and 10 μL essential oil solution were added. Four two-fold dilutions were carried out to give final concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL. The plate was incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere for 48 h. The cell monolayers were fixed in absolute methanol, stained with Giemsa, and evaluated using a light microscope. The number of intracellular amastigotes was determined by counting 25 macrophages per sample. The results are expressed as percent reduction of infection rate (% infected macrophages × number amastigotes per infected macrophage) compared to that of the controls. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were determined from the concentration-response linear curves. Each evaluation was carried out in triplicate and the results expressed as means ± SD.
