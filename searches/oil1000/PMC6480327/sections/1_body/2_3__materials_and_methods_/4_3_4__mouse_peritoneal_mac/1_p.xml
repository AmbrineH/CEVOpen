<p class="p">The median cytotoxic concentrations (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of the essential oils on mouse peritoneal macrophages (the host cells of 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> parasites) were determined as previously described [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Macrophages were collected from the peritoneal cavities of normal BALB/c mice and suspended in ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), supplemented with antibiotics. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates (3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Non-adherent cells were removed. Into the wells of column 2 and 7, 2 μL of essential oil solutions (as above) and 48 μL medium (supplemented with 10% HFBS and antibiotics) were also added. Two-fold serial dilutions down each lane were carried out to give final concentrations of 12.5–200 μg/mL. The macrophages were incubated for 72 h, after which the cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay (as above), using 15 μL/well. The CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was calculated for each compound in the same manner as the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and selectivity indices (SI) for each essential oil were determined (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for macrophages / IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> for promastigotes).
