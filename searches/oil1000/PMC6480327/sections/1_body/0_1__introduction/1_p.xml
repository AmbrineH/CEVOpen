 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The disease is transmitted by several members of Phlebotominae sand flies. The genera 
 <italic class="italic">Lutzomyia</italic> (New World) and 
 <italic class="italic">Phlebotomus</italic> (Old World) are the only hematophagous vectors of the diseases. Leishmaniasis is considered by the World Health Organization to be a neglected tropical disease [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Depending on the 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> species, the disease can manifest itself in three main forms: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. There are currently around 12â€“15 million people worldwide infected by 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> spp. with an estimated 350 million people at risk of acquiring leishmaniasis. Unfortunately, at the present time, there are no vaccines or prophylactic medicines available to prevent the disease. Current chemotherapeutic treatment options include sodium stibogluconate, meglumine antimoniate, conventional (deoxycholate) and liposomal amphotericin B, pentamidine isethionate, miltefosine and paromomycin. However, these agents suffer from severe side effects, poor efficacy, limited availability, high cost, or developing resistance [
