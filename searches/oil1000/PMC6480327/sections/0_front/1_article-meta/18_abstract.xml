 <p class="p">Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by members of the 
  <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> genus of parasitic protozoa that cause different clinical manifestations of the disease. Current treatment options for the cutaneous disease are limited due to severe side effects, poor efficacy, limited availability or accessibility, and developing resistance. Essential oils may provide low cost and readily available treatment options for leishmaniasis. In-vitro screening of a collection of 52 commercially available essential oils has been carried out against promastigotes of 
  <italic class="italic">Leishmania amazonensis</italic>. In addition, cytotoxicity has been determined for the essential oils against mouse peritoneal macrophages in order to determine selectivity. Promising essential oils were further screened against intracellular 
  <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> amastigotes. Three essential oils showed notable antileishmanial activities: frankincense (
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> spp.), coriander (
  <italic class="italic">Coriandrum sativum</italic> L.), and wintergreen (
  <italic class="italic">Gualtheria fragrantissima</italic> Wall.) with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values against the amastigotes of 22.1 ± 4.2, 19.1 ± 0.7, and 22.2 ± 3.5 μg/mL and a selectivity of 2, 7, and 6, respectively. These essential oils could be explored as topical treatment options for cutaneous leishmaniasis.
