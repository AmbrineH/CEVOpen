<p class="p">The DSC was performed using a DSC Q20 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The device was calibrated using an Indium, and the samples were scanned under nitrogen gas purging (20 mL/min). For measurements, 3–5 mg of samples was placed in an aluminum pan and covered with an aluminum lid. The heating rate was set at 10 °C/min. The results of the analysis were assessed in the range of 10 °C~140 °C. The peak melting temperature for each endothermic curve in the thermogram was determined automatically using the DSC solution software (TA Universal Analysis 2000).</p>
