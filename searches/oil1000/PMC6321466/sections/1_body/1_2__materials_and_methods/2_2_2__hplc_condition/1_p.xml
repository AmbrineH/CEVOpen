<p class="p">The HPLC analysis of FL in samples was conducted using the Waters 2695 HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), which is equipped with a UV-Vis detector (Waters 2487, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). FL was separated by a reverse-phase column (C18, 3.5 μm, 2.1 mm × 10 cm) (Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase was a mixture of water, acetonitrile, and acetic acid (12:7:1,
