<p class="p">In the fasted male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing 280–290 g (Orient Bio, Sungnam, Korea), the oral pharmacokinetics was investigated and compared for the FL suspension in 0.3% CMC-Na and F2 formulation (

 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The animals were fasted overnight, but allowed to drink water. Under the anesthetic condition with Zoletil (20 mg/kg, intramuscular injection), femoral arteries were cannulated for blood sample collection with a Clay Adams PE-50 polyethylene tube (Parsippany, NJ, USA) filled with heparinized saline (20 IU/mL). After their recovery from the surgery, the rats were orally administered FL at the dose of 10 mg/kg. After the oral administration, blood samples (100 µL) were collected at predetermined time intervals (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480, and 1440 min). Plasma was subsequently obtained by centrifuging whole blood at 4 °C for 10 min and then stored at −20 °C before the analysis. Plasma samples were pretreated with a methanolic solution containing internal standard (IS, 500 ng/mL), and then centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 15 min to obtain the supernatant.
