<p class="p">For the analysis of FL in rat plasma, we used the UHPLC system with the Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with an auto-sampler (G7167B), a flexible pump (G7104A), a Multicolumn Thermostat (MCT) (G7116B), and a DAD detector (G7117A). A Synergi™ 4 µm polar, Reversed-Phase (RP) 80A column (150 × 2.0 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) successfully achieved a good separation with endogenous substances. Isocratic condition was applied with the mobile phase consisting of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 3.5) and acetonitrile (25:75,
