<p class="p">Dissolution tests of the FL-loaded formulations and raw FL were performed using a VK 7000 dissolution tester (VanKel, Cary, NC, USA). Each sample filled in a gelatin capsule shell (#1), equivalent to 40 mg FL, was prepared and place into the dissolution tester at 37 ± 0.5 °C using the paddle method of 50 rpm with 900 mL of pH 1.2 buffer. An aliquot (5 mL) of the samples was collected at the predetermined time intervals, filtered through a 0.45 um membrane filter (DISMIC
