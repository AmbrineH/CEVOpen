<p class="p">In order to select specific oils and surfactants that would exhibit the optimum dispersed particle size, various vehicle compositions without the drug were prepared and evaluated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, oils and surfactants were weighed at various weight ratios (1/3, 2/2, or 3/1), heated to 60 °C, and stored at 4 °C for 24 h for possible solidification. The samples were taken out and equilibrated at room temperature. Then, 100 mg of the sample was taken, and 1 mL of water at 37 °C was added. This was followed by vortexing for 1 min to completely disperse the samples. The particle size of the samples was measured by particle size analyzer, and the melting point of each vehicle composition was measured by DSC.
