<p class="p">The solubility of FL in various oils and surfactants was evaluated. Kollisolv MCT 70, Lauroglycol 90, Capmul MCM C8, Gelucire 44/14, Kolliphor HS 15, or TPGS were commonly tested at 60 Â°C, considering the intrinsic melting point of solid surfactants. An excess of FL powder was added to 1 g of each oil and surfactant; thereafter, the solution was stirred until it was suspended. 0.5 g of supernatant was obtained after centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and then diluted 5 times with the above-mentioned mobile solution under the HPLC condition specified above. The FL amount was measured thrice.</p>
