 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, was dispersed into 3 mL of water with a mild vortexing for 1 min. The particle size was determined using a particle size analyzer (NanoBrook 90Plus, Brookhaven instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY, USA) at the wavelength of 659 nm and the scattering angle of 90°. The temperature was set at 25 °C, and the number of measurements was set at 5 cycles. For measurement, each sample was diluted 20 times with distilled water. The measurements were repeated thrice.
