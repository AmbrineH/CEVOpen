<p class="p">The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the Pharsight
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> WinNonlin program (Ver 8.0, Certara, Moutain View, CA, USA). The analyzed parameters included the maximum plasma concentration (
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>), time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>), half-life (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1/2</sub>), area under the plasma concentration-time curve to the last time point or infinity time (AUC
 <sub class="sub">last</sub> or AUC
 <sub class="sub">∞</sub>), and mean residence time (MRT). Briefly, AUC
 <sub class="sub">last</sub> was calculated by the linear trapezoidal method from 0 to the last time point. AUC
 <sub class="sub">∞</sub> was calculated as AUC
 <sub class="sub">last</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>, where 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> is the last measured concentration and 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic> denotes the slope of the terminal phase. Experiments were performed in triplicates and data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA was used to determine statistically significant differences among groups. The Prism software (version 4.0) was used for statistical analyses. 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
