 <italic class="italic">PXRD</italic> was measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Ultima IV, Toyko, Japan), which is equipped with a Linxeye 1-D detector. Each sample was added to the grid, and the diffraction pattern of each sample was measured using a Cu/Kα radiation source (40 kV and 40 mA) with the acquisition time of 0.2 s per step. The scanning range was 2~50° in the 2θ range.
