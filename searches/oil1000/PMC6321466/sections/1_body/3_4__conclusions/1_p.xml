<p class="p">In the present study, a novel SSP formulation containing FL was constructed based on the phase diagram, and physical properties were evaluated by measuring particle sizes, melting points and crystallinity; the dissolution test was also performed. The systemic approach used for optimizing SNEDDS of FL consisted of screening candidate vehicle compositions based on the pseudo-ternary phase diagram and establishing SSP formulation based on the selected vehicle compositions. The FL-solubilized SSP in the mixture of the selected oil and surfactant existed as a solid at room temperature, with the particle diameter of 50 nm or less and high dispersibility in the aqueous medium. The results of the analysis of the FL dissolution performance data revealed that the SNEDDS efficiently improved solubilization of poorly water soluble FL, providing a significantly higher dissolution rate than that of raw FL. Furthermore, in the results of the analysis of the in vivo pharmacokinetic data with SSP formulation, oral bioavailability of FL in rats dramatically increased, with 193% of relative bioavailability, as compared to the raw FL suspension. These findings suggest that this solid SNEDDS formulation could ensure physical stability of the drug product over the conventional liquid or solid SNEDDS and, most importantly, facilitate the oral absorption of the lipophilic drugs. Ultimately, the approach to developing solid SNEDDS, demonstrated in the present study, could contribute to improving drug formulations, thereby enhancing the bioavailability of various lipophilic drug molecules.</p>
