<p class="p">A total of 22 formulations were prepared, based on the FL solubility curve that was drawn using the measured solubility values. According to the observed physical states and the particle size of the dispersed phase, a particular pseudo-ternary phase diagram was constructed (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The calculated solubility curve of FL was considered to be a useful criterion in determining the maximum solubilization (%) of FL in each type of FL formulation. FL was assumed as completely dissolved in the compositions within the calculated solubility curve. The physical states of the SNEDDS preconcentrate were solids at room temperature when the weight ratios of FL and TPGS were either 10% and &gt;50%, or 20% and 80%. In other regions, the SNEDDS preconcentrates existed in the semisolid and liquid states. With an increase the weight ratio of FL from 10% to 20%, the physical states changed from solid to liquid. When the weight ratio of FL became 20% or larger, solidification of TPGS was suppressed, possibly resulting from the high contents of FL. The particles in the dispersed phase showed small sizes of below 100 nm in the formulations of FL = 10% and TPGS of â‰¥60%. Therefore, the pseudo-ternary phase diagram constructed by compositions of drug (FL), oil, and surfactant was regarded as a useful tool to confirm the effect of the drug contents on particle sizes in the dispersed phase, and to set the weight % range of vehicle compositions for solubilizing water-insoluble drugs. Based on the phase diagram (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), we organized important findings such as physical states, particle sizes, and peak melting points for the representative SSP formulations composed of FL, Kollisolv MCT 70, and TPGS with various weight ratios (see
