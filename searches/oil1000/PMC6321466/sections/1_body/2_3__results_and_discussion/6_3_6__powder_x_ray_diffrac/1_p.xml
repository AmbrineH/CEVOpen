<p class="p">The PXRD patterns were analyzed for F1, F2, F6, TPGS and raw flurbiprofen (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The distinct peaks of TPGS (17.44°, 21.94°, and 24.80°) were observed in all three formulations (F1, F2, and F6), whereas the intrinsic peak of FL disappeared. This result suggests that FL might have been completely dissolved at the molecular level in the SNEDDS containing oil and surfactant. The intensity of the peaks derived from TPGS decreased in the formulations of F1, F2, F6. These PXRD patterns suggest that these formulations were partial mixtures of crystal and amorphous forms. With lower intensities than raw TPGS, the peaks from TPGS still remained in these formulations. This result can be attributed to the fact that TPGS partially existed in the crystalline state in those formulations, which were in the solid state at room temperature.
