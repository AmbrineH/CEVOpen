<p class="p">The weight ratio of oil to surfactant (i.e., 1/3, 2/2, or 3/1) was used to prepare vehicle mixtures; in the next step, these mixtures were evaluated for the particle size of the dispersed phase and the melting point (see 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). With an increase in the ratio of oil to surfactant, the mean particle size of the dispersed phase increased, and the melting point of vehicle decreased. These findings are consistent with previous reports [
 <xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The vehicle with Kollisolv MCT 70 showed a small particle size (132.1 ± 10.5 nm) and existed in the solid state with the melting point above 30 °C. The mean particle size of the vehicle containing Capmul MCM C8 was smaller than that of Lauroglycol 90 and Kollisolv MCT 70, but it existed in the liquid state at room temperature. The vehicle with the surfactant Gelucire 44/14 had a large particle size, but existed in the solid state at room temperature. On the other hand, the mean particle size of the vehicle made of the surfactant Kolliphor HS 15 was small when the oil component (Kollisolv MCT 70, Lauroglycol 90, or Capmul MCM C8) was included with a smaller or equal amount in the weight ratio (oil/Kolliphor HS = 1/3 or 2/2). Vehicles containing Kolliphor HS 15 existed mainly in the liquid state at room temperature, except for the vehicle composition of 1/3 weight ratio (Kollisolv MCT 70 over Kolliphor HS 15) as a solid. Finally, after the repeated experiments, vehicles composition of Kollisolv MCT 70 and TPGS at the weight ratio of 1/3, 2/2, or 3/1 yielded small and uniform particle size (132.12 ± 10.51 nm, 278.95 ± 26.25 nm, and 396.63 ± 21.34 nm, respectively), and existed in the solid state with high melting points (36.96 °C, 36.58 °C, 36.37 °C, respectively). Therefore, Kollisolv MCT 70 and TPGS were selected as the proper type of oil and surfactant for further research.
