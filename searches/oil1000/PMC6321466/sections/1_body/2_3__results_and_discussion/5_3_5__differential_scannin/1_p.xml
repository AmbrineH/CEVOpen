<p class="p">The thermal changes of the formulations were confirmed by the results of the DSC analysis. TPGS has been known to be a thermally stable surfactant with low melting and high decomposition temperatures and can be mixed with drug molecules to improve their physicochemical stabilities [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In our results (see 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), F1, F2, and F6 were found to be in the solid state at room temperature, and F5 was in the liquid state. Corresponding thermograms are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. F1, F2, and F6 showed a newly-shifted single endothermic peak melting point (33.59 °C, 32.37 °C, 30.74 °C, respectively) probably derived from TPGS (39.85 °C) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In F1, F2, F5, and F6, FL was completely dissolved, and the endothermic peak of the inherent melting point (116.88 °C) of raw FL disappeared, due to the amorphous state. With an increase of the weight ratio of TPGS in formulation, the peak melting temperature shifted to a lower temperature (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Compared to F1 containing 90% TPGS, F2 and F6 with 80% TPGS showed lower melting points. There were double peaks for F6 (20% FL), indicating a heterogeneous solid state (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Finally, F5 in the liquid state has shown no distinct endothermic peaks, suggesting that the formulation does not contain any crystalline forms (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>).
