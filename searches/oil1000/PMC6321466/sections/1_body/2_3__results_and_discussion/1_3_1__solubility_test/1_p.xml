<p class="p">To determine the suitable surfactants or oil components for solubilizing FL in the SNEDDS, the saturation solubility of FL in the presence of various surfactants and oils was evaluated (see 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The solubility test was performed at 60 °C to melt the surfactant in a solid state at room temperature and to get the maximum solubility of FL. Instead of using weight per unit volume, the measured solubility values of FL in the presence of surfactants or oils were expressed as a mass fraction (weight/weight percent), since this approach is more reasonable in terms of weighing the surfactant and oil agents in solid or highly viscous liquid states at room temperature by the scale (rather than measuring by volume). According to the results, the solubility of FL in the amphiphilic surfactant (30~35%) was higher than that in oil (20~25%), as FL also has amphiphilic-like properties with its structure moieties, i.e., a lipophilic benzene ring and a hydrophilic carboxyl group [

 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the solubility values of FL in surfactants or oils were above 20% (

 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The highest solubility of FL was found to be 24.85 ± 0.20% and 34.28 ± 4.26%, in Kollisolv MCT 70 and TPGS, respectively. However, as shown by the results of one-way ANOVA, no statistically significant differences were observed in solubility values among oils or surfactants. Therefore, various vehicle compositions were characterized for the physicochemical properties and vehicle performances in further research.
