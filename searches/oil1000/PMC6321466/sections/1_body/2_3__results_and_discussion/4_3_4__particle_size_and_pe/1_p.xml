<p class="p">Size range of particles in the SNEDDS is an essential factor that could affect drug dissolution kinetics and bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. According to numerous previous reports, nano-sized particles can possess a large surface area, which contributes to achieving a rapid dissolution and absorption enhancement [
 <xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, F1~F4 containing 10% FL exhibited very small and uniform particle sizes of below 50 nm with polydispersity index (PI) less than 0.3 (PI; F1 = 0.21 ± 0.05, F2 = 0.08 ± 0.03, F3 = 0.11 ± 0.05, F4 = 0.26 ± 0.11, mean ± S.D.). F5 showed the highest particle size on average, presumably due to the inclusion of Kollisolv MCT 70 with a high percentage (70%). Moreover, F5 produced precipitation of FL after storage of 4 weeks at room temperature (data not shown), which implicate the instability of liquid SNEDDS preconcentrate. But F1~F4, solid SNEDDS preconcentrates, gave good dispersion in water with no precipitation at that time point. F6~F8 containing 20% or 30% FL showed bigger particle sizes of 100~300 nm as compared to those of F1~F4. With an increase of the contents (%) of FL and a decrease of surfactants, the mass and volume of the dispersed FL could increase, thereby promoting an increase of particle sizes of dispersed droplets [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Peak melting point for F1~F4 was on average 30.74 °C~33.59 °C, which might have resulted from the high percentages of TPGS. However, F5~F9 containing FL &gt; 20% or a low amount of TPGS (20%) exhibited no significant melting or low melting point of ≤30 °C with liquid or semi-solid states. As a result, F2 (FL/Kollisolv MCT 70/TPGS = 10/10/80, weight %) represented a small particle size of 13.74 ± 2.21 nm with a suitable solid state at room temperature.
