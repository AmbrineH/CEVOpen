<p class="p">The dissolution test was performed for the solid formulations with the confirmed physical properties, including melting points and crystallinity (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The comparison of F2 and F7 suggests that the contents of FL (%) could have influenced the dissolution rate and the cumulative drug release level. F2 composed of FL/Kollisolv MCT 70/TPGS (10/10/80%) showed a rapid dissolution rate at pH 1.2, reaching the mean dissolution rate of 95.70% in 15 min. However, F1 composed of FL/Kollisolv MCT 70/TPGS with the ratio of 10/0/90% gave a slower mean dissolution rate with 24.91% in 15 min compared to that of F2. F7 with more Kollisolv MCT 70 (10%) provided a higher dissolution rate than F6 without this oil type. In F6 and F7, where commonly 20% FL was loaded, dispersed particle sizes were similar, but the mean dissolution rates in 15 min appeared very different (19.26% and 77.35%, respectively). This dramatic difference in dissolution profiles of F6 and F7 might be linked to whether Kollisolv MCT 70 was used. Based on these observations, Kollisolv MCT 70 was found to be an important component to facilitate FL release from the formulation. Previous studies on the emulsion formulations using Kollisolv MCT 70 support this conclusion [
