<p class="p">The pharmacokinetic results outlined above demonstrate that our strategy to develop a novel SNEDDS containing FL using surfactants or oils selected by the pseudo-ternary phase diagram has successfully contributed to optimizing the final SSP formulation. Initially, the SSP formulations produced by combinations of candidate vehicle compositions were screened for the physical states, particle sizes, and melting temperature, and then used for the construction of the phase diagram. After investigating dissolution kinetics, F2 formulation was determined as the optimal formula of FL, showing an enhanced solubility of FL in the physiological medium. Finally, the results of the in vivo oral absorption study confirmed that F2 formulation as the optimized SSP improved the oral bioavailability, with a 1.9-fold higher AUC than that of the raw FL.</p>
