<p class="p">Based on the dissolution profile, F2 formulation containing FL was evaluated for oral pharmacokinetic studies in rats. Until 24 h after the administration of F2 formulation, whole plasma concentration profiles were compared with FL suspension in 0.3% CMC-Na. The calculated pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, as compared to the FL suspension group, the F2 formulation group maintained dramatically higher plasma concentrations. Maximum concentration in plasma (
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) and oral systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) were significantly increased in the F2 formulation group (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.00002 for 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.00012 for AUC
 <sub class="sub">âˆž</sub>); 2.3-fold and 1.9-fold higher than FL suspension, respectively (see 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). As compared to the FL suspension group, the calculated relative bioavailability for F2 was observed to amount to 193%. The peak concentration time (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) also changed significantly: From 228 min to 60 min. This behavior with F2 group reaching the maximum plasma concentration within a shorter time could be explained by dissolution profiles in vitro, showing much faster dissolution than FL suspension (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00247-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). However, other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as half-life (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1/2</sub>) and MRT, remained unchanged, which means that, by contrast to the changed absorption phase, changing drug formulation did not affect the elimination phase. According to the correlation between dissolution profiles and pharmacokinetic data, enhanced solubility and dissolution rates in the F2 formulation possibly led to an improvement of oral absorption of FL in the gastrointestinal tract.
