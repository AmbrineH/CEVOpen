<p class="p">The self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) is a formulation technology to be applied for poorly water-soluble drugs with high lipophilicity. Due to optimization, the SNEDDS formulation containing oils, and surfactants (or co-surfactants) enable an increase of the solubilization of drugs in the aqueous medium [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The SNEDDS are a particulate type of drug carriers with the size range of 20~200 nm dispersed in water; drug molecules are incorporated into the interfacial films or nano-sized oil droplets possessing a large interfacial surface area. With this approach, it is possible to enhance drug solubility and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby improving oral bioavailability. Representatively, some commercial drugs are available in the SNEDDS formulations, such as ritonavir (Norvir

 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, for these formulations, several reports have demonstrated some hypersensitivity reactions as side effects, presumably related to types of surfactants. Cremophor EL has been known to cause the gastrointestinal tract toxicity [

Moreover, these conventional SNEDDS formulations have been developed in the liquid state, which imposed several limitations on the manufacturing process, such as high production costs and physical instability issues, including drug precipitation, phase separation, and/or the incompatibility between the fill ingredients and the gelatin capsule shell at the storage temperature [
