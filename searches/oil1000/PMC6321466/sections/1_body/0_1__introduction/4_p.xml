<p class="p">In the present study, a new pseudo-ternary phase diagram was constructed only using a solid surfactant, oil, and drug. Solid SNEDDS preconcentrate (SSP) was manufactured using the simple mixing method without employing solid carriers, showing small uniform particles in the dispersion, and the solid state region of SSP was confirmed in the pseudo-ternary phase diagram. The physical and chemical properties of SSP were investigated in terms of particle size measurement, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD). The optimized SSP was further investigated for dissolution performance and oral pharmacokinetics in rats.</p>
