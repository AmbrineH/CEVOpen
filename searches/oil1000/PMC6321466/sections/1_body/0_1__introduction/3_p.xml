<p class="p">On the other hand, in order to overcome formulation challenges associated with the liquid SNEDDS, the solid SNEDDS has been widely investigated for the drugs with poor water solubility. Commonly, the solid SNEDDS was prepared by adsorbing liquid SNEDDS materials onto solid carriers, such as carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polyvinylalcohol, silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate, followed by the spray drying [

For example, representative drug compounds with low aqueous solubility (e.g., curcumin, dexibuprofen, and nimodipine) have been developed with the solid SNEDDS method, showing improved physical stability in the final products [

 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-10-00247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. These studies suggest that the physical stability of the final drug formulations can be ensured by devising the solid SNEDDS; other advantages of the solid SNEDDS are that it provides enhanced drug solubility or bioavailability. The solid SNEDDS has been mainly prepared by dissolving the liquid state in a co-solvent system and further removing the solvent by the spray drying to get powdered products. However, despite the improved physical stability, this method still has several disadvantages, such as a complicated manufacturing process, the use of a large number of additives, and increased particle sizes after redispersion of solidified SNEDDS in water.
