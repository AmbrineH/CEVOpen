<p class="p">The study included the evaluation of the activity of essential oils obtained from Pollena Aroma Company ((Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki, Poland). Antifungal susceptibility testing of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> clinical isolates was performed according to the NCCLS reference microdilution method. Serial two-fold dilutions of the tested substances were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) buffered to pH 7.0 with MOPS buffer (3-
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ, USA) in 96-well microtiter plates in a final volume of 100 µL. Cinnamon oil was diluted 10-fold in DMSO (Sigma Aldrich). The final concentrations of the oils were in the range 0.005–2.5% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and 0.002–0.125% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) for cinnamon oil. The final concentration of the solvent did not exceed 2.5% for DMSO, and did not influence the growth of yeast. Suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared by taking one loop of pure culture into sterile water and adjusting the optical density to 0.1 at 660 nm wavelength before further 50-fold dilution in an RPMI 1640 medium resulting in 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> CFU/mL. One hundred microliters of such suspension were inoculated to each well of the microtiter plate, leaving a drug-free column as sterility controls. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. MIC values were read visually as the first concentration where no growth was observed.
