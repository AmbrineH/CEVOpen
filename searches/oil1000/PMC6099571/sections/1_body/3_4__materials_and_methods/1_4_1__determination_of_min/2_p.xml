<p class="p">Additionally, minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFC) were investigated. A small aliquot of suspension (around 5 µL) from each well was transferred using a 48-well stamp to YPD (Yeast extract Peptone Dextrose) (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland) agar plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Concentrations where no growth was observed were assigned as MFC.</p>
