<p class="p">To assess whether the product binds to the fungal membrane sterols, MIC values with the addition of an exogenous source of ergosterol and without ergosterol were evaluated. Medium with ergosterol was prepared at the time of the test. To this end, ergosterol powder (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO (no more than 4% of final volume) and Tween 80 (Sigma Aldrich) (no more than 1% of final volume), heated to a temperature of 55 °C and mixed intensively. The solution was added to RPMI 1640 medium through a 0.2-µm filter (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Plates were prepared according to the method described in “Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration”. The final concentration of ergosterol in each well was 100 µg/mL. Plates were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C. Amphotericin B (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control as it is known to affect the membrane ergosterol. Investigations were carried out in duplicate. MIC values were read as the lowest concentrations where no growth of yeast was observed. If the mechanism of the selected essential oil action is associated with membrane sterols, the MIC in the presence of ergosterol is supposed to be higher than in a medium without ergosterol, thus this binding assay reflected the ability of the compound to bind with the ergosterol. Additionally, MFC values were evaluated according to the method described in “Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC)”.</p>
