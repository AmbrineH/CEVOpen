 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 strain was grown overnight in Sabouraud medium (Oxoid, Basingstokee, UK) (150 RPM, 30 °C). Cell suspension was centrifuged, washed twice with Milli-Q water. Optical density (OD
 <sub class="sub">660</sub>) was adjusted to 1.0 in Milli-Q water. Cells were treated with EOs at concentrations corresponding to 1 × MIC, 2 × MIC and 4 × MIC (1 × MIC for the oils were as follows: thyme 0.625%, lemon 0.625%, geranium 1.25%, cinnamon 0.016%, basil 0.31%, clove 1.25%. The presented MIC values are higher than in the case of studying time kill assay, because experiments were performed about one year later, which resulted in a significant decrease in the oils’ activity). At the same time, solutions of EOs of the same concentrations were prepared as controls of potassium ion content in oils. The cells were vigorously shaken for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged (3000 RPM, 5 min) and the supernatant was transferred to new tubes. The ion potassium concentration was measured with a flame ionizing detector BWB-1 (BWB Technologies Ltd., Newburye, UK).
