<p class="p">Possible synergistic action of common antifungal agents in combination with the essential oils was determined by the checkerboard method. After overnight culture (16–18 h) on YPD agar plates, colonies of the reference strains (
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231, 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> DSM 11226) were suspended in sterile water. Optical density (OD
 <sub class="sub">660</sub>) was adjusted to about 0.1 (corresponding to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells in 1 mL) and the inoculum was diluted 50-fold to obtain a cell density of 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells per 1 mL of suspension. A gradient of antifungal chemotherapeutic was established along the horizontal axis and essential oil along the vertical axis. The first row contained only the gradient of chemotherapeutic and the tenth column gradient of the natural product. One hundred microliters of the prepared suspension were inoculated to each well of the plate. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The MIC values of the compound alone or in combination were read visually. ΣFIC (fractional inhibitory concentrations) was determined according to the equation ΣFIC = FIC A + FIC B, where FIC A is the MIC of a medicament in combination/MIC of the drug alone, FIC B is the MIC of the second compound in combination/MIC of the compound alone. The combination is considered synergistic when the ΣFIC is ≤ 0.5, indifferent when the ΣFIC is &gt; 0.5 to &lt; 4, and antagonistic when the ΣFIC is ≥ 4.
