<p class="p">The effect of essential oils on the cell wall of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> strains was analyzed using a medium with the addition of sorbitol as an osmoprotectant. The final concentration of sorbitol (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) in each well was 0.8 M. The assay was performed by the microdilution method in 96-well plates in a manner like in the “Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration”. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Sorbitol acted as the fungal cell wall osmotic protective agent so the MIC values in a medium containing an agent acting against the cell wall in the presence of sorbitol are supposed to be higher than in a medium without the addition of sorbitol, confirming essential oils’ components’ interactions with cell wall building elements. Additionally, MIC values in the presence of cinnamaldehyde and sorbitol were checked to compare with the activity of cinnamon oil. Also, MFC values were evaluated according to the method described in “Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC)”.
