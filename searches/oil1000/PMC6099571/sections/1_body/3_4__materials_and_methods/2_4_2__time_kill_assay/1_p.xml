<p class="p">From the overnight culture (16–18 h) on YPD agar plates, a cell suspension was prepared in sterile water and the optical density at OD
 <sub class="sub">660</sub> was adjusted to about 0.1 (corresponding to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells per 1 mL of suspension). The inoculum was then diluted 10-fold in RPMI 1640 medium and treated with selected essential oils with the following concentrations: thyme—0.04%, lemon 0,16%, geranium—0.16%, basil 0.16%, clove—0.625% and for cinnamon oil cinnamon—0.016 or 0.031%, [

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>]. The suspensions of cells under the oils’ influence were first vigorously shaken and then incubated at 37 °C for 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. After the appropriate time of incubation, 1 mL of each suspension was centrifuged (3 min, 5000 RPM) and resuspended in PBS (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline). Ten-fold serial dilutions were prepared and 100 µL of each were inoculated on YPD agar plates. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Colony-forming units in the range 30–300 were counted and the number of cells in 1 mL (CFU/mL) was calculated.
