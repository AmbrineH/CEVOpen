<p class="p">Exogenous source of ergosterol in the medium may increase the MIC value for compounds that target this sterol in the cell membrane. In our study MIC values were significantly increased in the case of thyme and lemon oil in both species and slightly for clove oil. In the case of cinnamon and basil oil, the MIC values were unchanged or nearly unchanged in the ergosterol-containing medium. Amphotericin B, an agent known to act on ergosterol in the membrane, was used as a positive control (
