<p class="p">The efflux of potassium ions to a potassium-free medium is a common response of the cells to the presence of some compounds like essential oils. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01116-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows, at the concentrations of agents used, nearly no potassium efflux was detected in the presence of basil and lemon oil (the heights of the bars are comparable to the heights of the cells suspension bars). The highest efflux of potassium was observed for thyme oil, followed by clove and cinnamon oil. A little efflux of potassium was detected in the case of geranium oil, but only at the highest concentration. Additionally, in the case of thyme and cinnamon oil, there was no correlation between the potassium efflux and the concentration of EO used.
