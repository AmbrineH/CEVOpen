<p class="p">A control sample of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 not exposed to the action of essential oil grown for 2 h in hypha-inducing Lee medium resulted in 95% of mycelium forms. Cultures of the same strain incubated with selected EOs at concentrations equal to 1 × MIC revealed nearly now hypha forms, except of the sample that was under the influence of basil oil, where some mycelium forms were still visible (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01116-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Cultures were also treated with EOs for 24 h at concentrations equal to ½ × MIC (in order to use the highest available concentration and not inhibit growth at the same time). The percentage of mycelium forms in the control significantly declined, comparable to the sample treated with cinnamon oil. Hypha forms were also still observed in the sample with added basil oil.
