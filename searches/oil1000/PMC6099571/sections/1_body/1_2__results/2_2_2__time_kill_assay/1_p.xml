 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 cells were treated with EOs at a concentration equal to MIC as follows: thyme—0.04%, lemon 0.16%, geranium—0.16%, basil 0.16%, clove—0.625%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01116-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows that incubation with four of these products resulted in fungistatic effect, with a significant reduction in cell numbers after 6 and 24 h of at least two logarithmic rows. Much better results were obtained for basil oil, where 2 h incubation reduced the number of living cells to nearly zero. That means that for this strain the MIC and MFC values of basil oil were equal. For cinnamon oil separate analysis, with concentrations of 1 × MIC and 1 × MFC for two 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, was performed. The obtained results clearly indicate that both applied concentrations caused a fungicidal effect. However, for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> at a concentration equal to 1 × MIC a 24-h incubation was required. In other cases, a four-hour incubation was sufficient for total viability decrease (
