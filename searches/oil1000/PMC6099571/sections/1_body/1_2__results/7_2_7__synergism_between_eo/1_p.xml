<p class="p">Studies revealed nearly no synergistic interactions between antifungal drugs and the essential oils tested. The only example of possible synergism was between amphotericin B and geranium oil. The MIC of amphotericin B alone was evaluated at 0.125 μg/mL, while the MIC of EO was 0.08%. Inhibitory concentrations of the compounds in combination were as follows: 0.031 μg/mL for AmB and 0.02% for geranium oil. According to the checkerboard method, ∑FIC = 0.5, so the interaction can be considered as synergistic. Additionally, using the disc-diffusion method a synergistic effect of AmB and cinnamon oil was observed (
