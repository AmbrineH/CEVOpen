<p class="p">The composition analysis of six EOs has been performed by GC Ã— GC mass spectrometry. A quantitative analysis has been carried out by peak area normalization measurements without correction factors as percentages of each component (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01116-t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>). The highest diversity in chemical composition was marked for geranium oil, but the content of any particular component did not exceed 20%. The smallest number of components was seen for clove oil, with a predominance of eugenol (68.24%). Some monoterpenes were common for most of the tested oils (camphene, cymene, myrcene, pinene, and terpinene). The most active cinnamon oil contained high concentration of cinnamaldehyde (42.79%), while lemon oil contained the highest amount of citral (53.85%).
