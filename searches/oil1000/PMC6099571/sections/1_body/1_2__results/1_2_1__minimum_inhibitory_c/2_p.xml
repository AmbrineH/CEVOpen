<p class="p">Among all tested EOs, cinnamon oil exhibited the highest antifungal activity against isolates of both species with MIC and MFC values in the range of 0.002 (or less) to 0.125% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), followed by oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> (MIC and MFC values ≤ 2.5% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) against all strains tested). Within the tested range of concentration—up to 2.5% (

 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 114; 62.3%) revealed MIC below the concentration 0.002% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and respectively for 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> that was 56.6% (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 43). The modal of MIC values for thyme oil was 0.08% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), which was observed for 31 isolates (16.9%), however the growth of 30 isolates was inhibited at the concentration of this product lower than 0.005% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). The most frequent MIC value of geranium and clove oil was 0.16% and in the case of lemon and basil oils 0.313% (
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>). In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> that was 0.005% for lemon oil, 0.16% for thyme, geranium, and clove and 0.313% for basil oil. Considering fungicidal activity, the MFC concentration was mostly equal to or twice the MIC value (
