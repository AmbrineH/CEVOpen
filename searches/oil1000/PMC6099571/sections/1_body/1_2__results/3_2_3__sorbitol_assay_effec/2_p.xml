<p class="p">Additionally, an assay comparing cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde MIC values in the absence or presence of osmoprotectant (sorbitol or glycerol) was carried out (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01116-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The assay was performed on two reference strains and two clinical isolates (
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> 412 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> 342, both isolated from Children’s Memorial Health Institute’s patients). MIC values for cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde were in the range 0.008–0.031% (
