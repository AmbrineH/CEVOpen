<p class="p">MIC values for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> were checked in the presence or absence of 0.8 M sorbitol as an osmotic protectant in the medium. In the case of lemon and geranium oils, the MIC values stayed unchanged what suggests lack of their influence on cell wall structure (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01116-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). For basil oil, the MIC value in the presence of osmoprotectant was doubled for both tested species, indicating that cell wall may be a possible molecular target for this EO. In the presence of sorbitol, MIC values for thyme, clove, and, in particular, cinnamon oil were significantly decreased.
