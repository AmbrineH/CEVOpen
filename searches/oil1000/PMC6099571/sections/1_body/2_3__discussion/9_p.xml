<p class="p">The findings reported in this paper indicate the high antifungal potential of some essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> clinical isolates. This result is very interesting from the point of view of their potential use as an alternative for conventional treatment. Additionally, experiments confirming the possibility of a synergistic effect with amphotericin B allow us to conclude that EOs can be used as a supplement for traditional chemotherapy. The range of effective concentrations would allow for their use in treatment, e.g., in topical applications. Modes of EOs action undoubtedly require further clarification but it is commonly known that a rich mixture of compounds may cause many simultaneous cellular effects. Therefore, future experiments will focus on investigations of the mode of action of single compounds. Additionally, it is of great importance to establish which particular components of a mixture exert a synergistic effect with common antifungal drugs.
