<p class="p">In this study we also aimed to check the effect of EOs on the cell wall and cell membrane. In the case of investigating the effect on cell wall using sorbitol assay, the most puzzling results were obtained for cinnamon oil, as we observed a decrease in MIC value in a medium supplemented with sorbitol as osmoprotectant, instead of the expected increase. The main compound of cinnamon oil is cinnamaldehyde, which is thought to inhibit the activity of β-1,3-glucan and chitin synthase [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], two enzymes responsible for producing fungal cell wall components. The fungal cell wall is a dynamic structure that protects the cell from changes in osmotic pressure and other environmental stresses, while allowing the fungal cell to interact with its environment. The structure and biosynthesis of a fungal cell wall is unique to the fungi, and is therefore an excellent target for the development of antifungal drugs [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Our results revealed that the effect of cinnamon oil, as well as cinnamaldehyde, in both sorbitol- and glycerol-supplemented mediums was the opposite to what we assumed: MIC values decreased up to 16-fold. Sorbitol/glycerol is an agent stabilizing the osmotic pressure of the cell, and thus the MIC values of strong cell wall inhibitors are believed to be increased in their presence. On the other hand, high osmolarity causes osmotic stress and results in metabolism changes. The most predominant physiological effect is the production of intracellural glycerol to counterbalance the external osmotic pressure. The production of glycerol is a highly glucose-consuming process. As a result, cells exhibit limited activity of β-1,3-glucan synthase as well as chitin synthase. Sorbitol is therefore a factor that causes slight cell stress, which may cause the inhibition of cell growth in the presence of some nonspecific cell wall inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. As both cinnamaldehyde and sorbitol influence β-1,3-glucan synthase as well as chitin synthase activity, the decrease in MIC value for cinnamon oil in the presence of this osmoprotectant is explainable. In the case of the remaining oils, the effect on the cell wall was not so evident. A two-fold increase of the MIC value in the presence of sorbitol in the medium was observed for basil oil (for both 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>). The investigations of basil oil’s mode of anticandidal action are not very abundant, so it is hard to find a correlation concerning its effect on the cell wall. According to Cardoso’s group basil oil, as well as geraniol, contributes to marked cell wall thickening (results obtained on the basis of transmission electron microscopy images) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. On the other hand, Kaya et al. reported that 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> extracts possess antibacterial activity by causing bacterial cell wall degradation [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The effect of 
 <italic class="italic">P. graveolens</italic> EO is also not obvious. Essid and coworkers noted a two-fold increase of MIC of this EO in a medium supplemented with sorbitol, thereby suggesting its influence on the cell wall [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In our research, an increase in MIC value was not observed for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> isolate but a two-fold increase was noted for 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>; this does not give us an unambiguous answer about the influence of the oil on the cell wall. Overall, the changes in minimum inhibitory concentrations for the tested EOs were not significant in comparison to other well-known cell wall inhibitors; thus, we claim that the cell wall is a target of secondary importance.
