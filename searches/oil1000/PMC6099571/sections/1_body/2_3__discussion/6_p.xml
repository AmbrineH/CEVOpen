<p class="p">In our previous research we evaluated 
 <italic class="italic">CDR1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CDR2</italic> genes expression level coding for drug efflux transporters in 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> clinical isolates [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Taking into consideration isolates with significantly elevated gene expression levels according to the isolate susceptible to fluconazole, the MIC values for the tested oils were in the range: thyme &lt; 0.005–0.31, lemon &lt; 0.005–0.08, geranium 0.04–1.25, cinnamon &lt; 0.002–0.125, basil &lt; 0.005–0.63 and clove 0.04–1.25. If most constituents of EOs were substrates for these transporters, the assumed values of MIC concentrations would rather reach the highest range. In our experiment we observe that the MIC values of all tested EOs were not significantly different in the group of strains that upregulate drug pumps. Thus, we suggest that components of EOs do not necessarily have to be the substrates for CDR1p and CDR2p transporters.
