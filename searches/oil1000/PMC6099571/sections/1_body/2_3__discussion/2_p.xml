<p class="p">In this paper we showed the high antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus limonum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pelargonium graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Eugenia caryophyllus</italic> essential oils. The maximum concentration that prevented the growth of most 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> isolates was established as 1.25% (with some exceptions for lemon and clove oil). This allows for their potential use in pharmaceutical preparations for external application or inhalation, as using a 2% essential oil dilution is generally considered a safe guideline for the topical application of essential oils on adults [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Cinnamon, thyme, geranium, and basil oils inhibited the growth of all strains tested, up to the concentration of 1.25%. In the case of lemon oil, only seven out of 183 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> isolates had an MIC value higher than the cutoff value of 1.25%. Quite a similar situation was observed for clove oil: MIC = 2.5% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was found for eight 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> isolates and one 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>. Comparing the differences in activity of oils against two 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, no significant differences were observed except for lemon oil, which appeared to be more active toward 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> clinical isolates (for example, 35.5% of isolates revealed MIC values below 0.005%; for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> that was 11.5%). A great activity was established in the case of cinnamon oil. The concentration inhibiting the growth of all strains was not higher than 0.125% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). The vast majority of isolates revealed MIC values for this oil below 0.021 mg/mL (0.002%). Other investigators recorded similar results. For instance, Wang and coworkers reported that the average MIC value of cinnamon oil tested toward 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> clinical isolates was 0.064 mg/mL (MIC range 0.064–0.515 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The research group of Pires showed the anticandidal activity of cinnamon oil against 
 <italic class="italic">C. orthopsilosis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic> (MIC equal to 0.25 and 0.50 mg/mL, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. High antifungal activity against six 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> isolates was also reported by Brochot (MIC in the range 0.01–0.05% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The activity of cinnamon oil toward bacteria seems to be limited compared to fungi, e.g., the MIC values for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> reported by Zhang were both 1 mg/mL, while MBC values were equal to 4 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The explanation of this fact is connected to the molecular targets for cinnamaldehyde, which are glukan and chitin synthases absent in bacteria. On the other hand, other researchers have shown that cinnamon oil may cause other cellular effects like leakage of small electrolytes, proteins, and nucleic acids [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Nowatarska reports that cinnamon oil decreases the intracellular adenosine triphosphate concentration [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Additionally, the results of Clemente indicate that cinnamon oil produces protrusions and aggregation of cells [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In our opinion, all the further destructive effects of cinnamon oil toward pathogen cells are a result of its complex composition, in which remaining compounds have supplementary or synergistic activity. However, cinnamon aldehyde is crucial to the antifungal activity of this product. The GC analysis revealed that the investigated oil contained 42.79% of this component.
