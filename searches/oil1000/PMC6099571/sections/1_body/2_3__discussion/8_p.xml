<p class="p">Molecular switching between yeast, pseudohyphae, and hyphae phenotype is considered one of the most important virulence factors of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> as it enables the evasion of the host immune system and rapid infection establishment. Therefore, factors inhibiting hypha formation are considered interesting leads that could help in the prevention of invasive fungemia. In our study we showed that most of the tested EOs have the potential for 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> hypha formation inhibition. In this matter our results are convergent with those obtained by Braga (inhibition of hypha formation by thymol) [
