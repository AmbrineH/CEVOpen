<p class="p">The highest thyme oil MIC concentration established for both 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was 5.731 mg/mL (0.625% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)), but predominant values were 0.734 mg/mL (0.08% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)) or less than 0.046 mg/mL (0.005% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)). These results are in agreement with those obtained by other investigators. High anticandidal activity of thyme oil (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic>) was reported by Sakkas and coworkers (MIC 0.125 or 0.25% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The effectiveness of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> EO toward 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was also confirmed by Fani [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Antimicrobial activity (mainly toward bacteria) of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> (thymol chemotype), 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus zygis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">gracilis</italic> (thymol and two linalool chemotypes), and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus hyemalis</italic> Lange (thymol, thymol/linalool and carvacrol chemotypes) essential oils extracted from seven plants cultivated in Murcia (Spain) was reported by Rota and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Jamali tested the anticandidal activity of seven 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> species: 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus broussonetii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. ciliates</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. leptobotrys</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. maroccanus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. pallidus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. satureioides</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">T. serpyllum</italic> collected from different natural regions in southern and southwestern Morocco. He reported high antifungal activity toward four 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species (
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. parapsilosis</italic>) for EOs rich in thymol or carvacrol (MIC 0.43–0.9 mg/mL). 
 <italic class="italic">T. serpyllum</italic> EO, in which the predominant compound detected was linalyl acetate (52.2%), had the lowest anticandidal activity (MIC in the range 3.52–7.05 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The investigated in our studies thyme oil contained carvacrol and thymol at concentrations comparable to the product investigated by Jamali—0.42 and 1.75% of the sum of peaks area respectively. However, the dominant components of the product were myrcene (34.35% of area under the peak) and terpinene (46.55% of area under the peak). High activity of the tested EOs was also confirmed in a time kill assay. Most EOs in MIC concentration resulted in fungistatic effect (after 6 h incubation, the number of viable cell was stable and at least three logarithmic rows lower than in the control). When MIC and MFC values are equal, we observed very rapid viable cell count reduction (like in the case of basil oil). The usage of cinnamon oil in MFC concentration resulted in a reduction of the cell number to zero after 2 (
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>) or 4 h (
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>), while in terms of MIC concentration 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> was more sensitive (complete elimination of living cells occurred after 4 h).
