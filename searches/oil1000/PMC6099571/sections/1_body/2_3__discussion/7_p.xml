<p class="p">We also considered the possibility of synergism between common antifungals and essential oils. Ahmad et al. estimated that thymol and its isomer carvacrol possess synergistic action with fluconazole toward some isolates of the genus

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In our study the interaction between fluconazole and thyme oil was assigned as indifferent; however, thymol was not the predominant compound of the tested thyme oil. We found the possibility of interaction of amphotericin B with cinnamon or geranium oil. Amphotericin B is still a very powerful antifungal drug and resistance is rarely seen. However, at the same time it is a toxic compound used only in advanced fungemia, so any dosage reduction relating to the simultaneous usage of plant extract could be useful in antifungal chemotherapy.
