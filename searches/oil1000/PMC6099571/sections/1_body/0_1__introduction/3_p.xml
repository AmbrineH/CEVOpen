 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. EOs are rich mixtures of chemical compounds belonging to different chemical families, including terpenes, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, phenols, ethers, and ketones. Most essential oils are composed of terpenes, terpenoids, and other aromatic and aliphatic constituents with low molecular weights. Terpenes are a class of natural substances of vegetable origin formed by the condensation of isoprene units (C

 <sub class="sub">8</sub>) and are classified as monoterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>), the most representative molecules, and sesquiterpenes (C
 <sub class="sub">15</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Their derivatives containing oxygen are called terpenoids. Usually, the chemical characterization of many essential oils reveals the presence of only 2–3 major components at a fairly high concentration (20–70%) compared to other components present in trace amounts [
