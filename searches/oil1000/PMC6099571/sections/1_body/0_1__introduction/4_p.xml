<p class="p">The mechanism of antimicrobial action of EOs is complex and depends on their chemical composition and the quantity of the major single compounds. The antifungal mechanism of action of EOs is similar for antibacterial. Many reports revealed that constituents of EOs mixture cause cell membrane damage; moreover, they influence many other cellular activities including energy production [
