 <p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. In this study the activity of 
  <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Citrus limonum</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Pelargonium graveolens</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic>
  <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Eugenia caryophyllus</italic> essential oils (EOs) distributed by Pollena Aroma (Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki, Poland) was investigated against a group of 183 clinical isolates of 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 76 isolates of 
  <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic>. All of the oils exhibited both fungistatic and fungicidal activity toward 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> isolates. The highest activity was observed for cinnamon oil, with MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) values in the range 0.002–0.125% (
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>). The MIC values of the rest of the oils were in the range 0.005% (or less) to 2.5% (
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
  <italic class="italic">v</italic>). In most cases MFC (Minimum Fungicidal Concentration) values were equal to MIC or twice as high. Additionally, we examined the mode of action of selected EOs. The effect on cell wall components could not be clearly proved. Three of the tested EOs (thyme, lemon, and clove) affected cell membranes. At the same time, thyme, cinnamon, and clove oil influenced potassium ion efflux, which was not seen in the case of lemon oil. All of the tested oils demonstrated the ability to inhibit the transition of yeast to mycelium form, but the effect was the lowest in the case of cinnamon oil.
