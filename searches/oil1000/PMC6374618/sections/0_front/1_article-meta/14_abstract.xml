 <p class="p">Agarwood is a resinous part of the non-timber 
  <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> tree, which is a highly valuable product for medicine and fragrance purposes. To protect the endangered 
  <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species, mass plantation of 
  <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees has become a sustainable way in Asian countries to obtain the highly valuable agarwood. As only physiologically triggered 
  <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> tree can produce agarwood, effective induction methods are long sought in the agarwood industry. In this paper, we attempt to provide an overview for the past efforts toward the understanding of agarwood formation, the evolvement of induction methods and their further development prospects by integrating it with high-throughput omics approaches.
