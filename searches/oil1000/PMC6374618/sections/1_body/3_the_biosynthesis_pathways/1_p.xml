<p class="p">Agarwood formation can be related to the self-defense mechanism of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gao et al., 2012b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh and Sharma, 2015</xref>). Stresses trigger the defense responses of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species which in turn initiate the secondary metabolite biosynthesis and the accumulation of agarwood resin. Previously, we have mentioned that sesquiterpenes and PEC derivatives are the main constituents in agarwood. Hence, it is crucially important to understand the metabolic pathway for the regulation and biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes and chromone derivatives in 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species to effectively induce the agarwood formation.
