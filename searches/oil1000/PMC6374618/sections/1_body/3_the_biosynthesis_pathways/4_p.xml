<p class="p">On the other hand, chromones are a large group of secondary metabolites with wide-ranging potential therapeutic indications toward immunomodulation, inflammation, cancer, diabetes, neurological conditions, bacterial and viral infections (

Chromone is derived from a polycyclic organic compound namely benzopyran ring, with a keto group substitution on its oxime ring. It is generally believed that derivations of chromones take place as a consequence of the convergence of multiple secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways involving pentaketide pathway, shikimic acid pathway and the addition of nitrogenous moiety from amino acids or other sources (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liao et al. (2018)</xref> based on in-dept analysis of agarwood chemical constituents using GC-EL-MS and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS methods. In their study, the PECs was found to be the major agarwood resin constituents, which is comprised mostly of flindersia-type 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones (FTPECs). The formation of FTPECs is further elucidated to be possibly catalyzed by type III polyketide synthase (PKs) through condensation of dihydro-cinnamoyl-CoA analogs and malonyl-CoA with 2-hydroxy-benzoyl-CoA to produce PEC scaffold that will subsequently be catalyzed by hydroxylases or 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-methyltransferases (OMTs) to form structurally diverse FTPECs (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liao et al., 2018</xref>). Recent study showed that salinity stress could induce the biosynthesis of PECs in 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> calli (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis of these salt-induced 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> calli have identified several upregulated candidate genes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of PECs, including three OMT-encoding genes (flavonol-OMT 1, flavonol-3-OMT and caffeoyl-CoA-OMT) and a type III polyketide synthase gene encodes for chalcone synthase 1 (AsCHS1).
