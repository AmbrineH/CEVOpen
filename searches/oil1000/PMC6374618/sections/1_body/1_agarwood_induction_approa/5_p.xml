<p class="p">Through chemical induction approach, the time-consuming holing process can be minimized as less induction sites are needed to deliver the inducers throughout the plants via transpiration process. Properly formulated inducer was shown to be able to produce artificial agarwood with quality closely resembled to those obtained from natural source (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu Y. et al., 2013</xref>). In spite of the fast results and high yields, the application of chemical inducers still poses skepticism of toxicity on both human and environment. More assessments on chemical inducers are required to test its effectiveness on fields and also to popularize its use. Chemical inducers are undoubtedly more suitable for mass production with easier quality control than biological inoculum, which is highly potential to substitute conventional induction methods and the use of biological inoculum in agarwood industry.
