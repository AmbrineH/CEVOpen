<p class="p">With more understanding on 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic>-fungal interactions in promoting the agarwood formation, the induction methods gradually shifted from sole mechanical wounding into deliberate wounding coupled with the application of biological inoculum (

 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees were reported to deposit agarwood resin around the infected sites as barrier to prevent further fungal intrusion (

One obvious advantage of using fungal inoculum is that it is generally believed to be safe for handling and eco-friendly. However, fungal inoculation will normally give rise to localized and inconsistent quality of agarwood due to the different fungal consortium used. As a solution, laborious holing process and long incubation time is required to maximize the colonized surface area on the tree to produce better quality of agarwood (
