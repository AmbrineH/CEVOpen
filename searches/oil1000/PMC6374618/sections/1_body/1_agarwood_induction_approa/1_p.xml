<p class="p">The indiscriminate harvesting of agarwood from natural habitats has seriously hampered natural regeneration of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees, thus threatening the survival of the species in the wild. In order to meet the high market demand yet to protect the species from extinction, mass plantations of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees have been established across the Asian countries to allow sustainable agarwood production (

Since agarwood formation in natural environment is a very long process which can take up to 10 years, the development of effective induction technology has received a great attention as it is extremely crucial to ensure the stability of agarwood yield from the domesticated
