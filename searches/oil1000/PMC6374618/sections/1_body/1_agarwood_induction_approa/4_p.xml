<p class="p">Instead of relying on external stimuli to trigger plant responses, either by mechanical wounding or biological inoculum, some induction approaches have been developed to introduce signaling molecules directly and specifically into

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al., 2014c</xref>). To date, several induction approaches have been developed based on the chemical induction concept such as cultivated agarwood kit (CA-kit), the whole-tree agarwood inducing technique (Agar-Wit) and biologically agarwood-inducing technique (Agar-bit). CA-kit is a combined method based on physical wounding and chemical induction, where the inducing agent is applied into the 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> tree via an aeration device inserted into the wound (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blanchette and Heuveling, 2009</xref>). This method results in satisfying yield and quality, but the procedures are in some way conventional. On the other hands, Agar-Wit is a transpiration-assisted chemical treatment to form an overall wound in the tree, where the preloaded inducer in a transfusion set is distributed via plant transpiration (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu Y. et al., 2013</xref>). Through this method, a larger agarwood coverage area can be achieved, but unfortunately produces more decayed tissues. Similarly, Agar-bit method adopts the idea of distributing the inducing reagent by plant transpiration, except that the reagents are injected directly into the stems of the tree (
