<p class="p">By coupling with omics approaches such as single molecule real time sequencing technology (SMRT) which offers longer read lengths and highly contiguous

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rhoads and Au, 2015</xref>), thus it tends to be particularly useful for unsolved problems in genome and transcriptome of non-model 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species where their genomes are not available. With longer reads, the highly repetitive non-coding regulatory sequence of genes controlling the agarwood resin production can be easily obtained. Sequence similarity/identity-based integration can be used to establish the cross-reference data sets between the query sequences and their homologous references from various public databases and genetic resources, where genomic sequence structures, domain features, promoter regions and gene ontology for motifs can be assigned (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mochida and Shinozaki, 2011</xref>). The development of sequencing technology has made the future research on the whole genome sequencing of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species to be easier to fill in the lack of genome-wide information in the current situation. Data integration based on genome sequence is important to allow analysis of global changes of transcriptome through whole genome microarrays. The gene expression analysis of induced 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> at its entirety can be examined in broad coordinated trends by this approach, which is indiscernible by individual assays. The expression profiles obtained in this way will help to identify potential agarwood-producing biomarker genes that are important indicators for downstream applications of agarwood induction.
