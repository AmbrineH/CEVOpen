<p class="p">The types and derivatives of major compounds in agarwood are extremely wide and diverse, indicating the miscellaneous fragrance properties of agarwood from different species and regional sources. The better insight of agarwood metabolites will definitely facilitate the identification of universally accepted biomarkers for agarwood grading. Since the publication of the comprehensive review of 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Naef (2011)</xref> regarding the major constituents of agarwood, new compounds continue to be discovered in the later studies (

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The number of discovered compounds in agarwood will certainly be further increased in the future.
