<p class="p">The number and types of agarwood metabolite constituents of each reported studies vary depending on the agarwood source, extraction methods and analysis approaches used (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jong et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pasaribu et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, there are over 150 compounds as reviewed by 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Naef (2011)</xref> have been identified thus far in agarwood from different sources. Among these compounds, there are 70 sesquiterpenes and about 40 types of PECs which have been recognized in agarwood and their structures have been elucidated (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Naef, 2011</xref>). Several sesquiterpenes were observed to be more frequently present in agarwood from different studies, including aromadendrene, agarospirol, β-agarofuran, guaiol and (-)-aristolene (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jong et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Some sesquiterpenes are reported to be species-specific, such as jinkoh-eremol and

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hashim et al., 2016</xref>). It is worth mentioning that in the study of 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pasaribu et al. (2015)</xref>, the content of aromadendrene was found to be greater in higher grade agarwood and therefore it was suggested as an effective chemical marker for agarwood grading. Besides aromadendrene, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jayachandran et al. (2014)</xref> later has proposed an additional marker valencene which can be important in the grading of agarwood oil.
