<p class="p">The main attraction of the agarwood industry is its extremely high market value. Yet, the price of agarwood is largely determined by its quality which is graded solely based on human experience from the age-old practices of each country. The unavailability of standard quality grading system can be due to the intricate appearance of the traded agarwood and personal interest. The currently adopted agarwood quality assessment in the market has been extensively reviewed by

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu Y. Y. et al., 2017</xref>). Many studies have been conducted to clarify the metabolite composition of agarwood obtained either from wild or artificially induced methods (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hashim et al., 2014</xref>). It was concluded that the composition of agarwood resin is mainly composed of the mixtures of sesquiterpenes and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones (PECs) (
