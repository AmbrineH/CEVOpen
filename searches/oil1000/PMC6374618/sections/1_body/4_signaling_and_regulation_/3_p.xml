<p class="p">Besides mechanical wounding, the MeJA is an effective elicitor to increase the sesquiterpenes content in 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu Y. H. et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have shown that heat shock can increase the expression of genes involved in the Jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, including allene oxide cyclase (
 <italic class="italic">AOC</italic>), allene oxide synthase (
 <italic class="italic">AOS</italic>), lipoxygenase (
 <italic class="italic">LOX</italic>) and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3 (
 <italic class="italic">OPR3</italic>) genes, which subsequently lead to the production of JA and the accumulation of sesquiterpene in the 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> suspension cell culture (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> coronatine-insensitive protein 1 (AsCOI1), acts as a receptor in MeJA signaling pathway, has been cloned and characterized (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liao et al., 2015</xref>). Expression study of 
 <italic class="italic">AsCOI1</italic> has demonstrated that the gene was expressed in a tissue-specific pattern which is highest in stem, followed by root and leaves. The findings imply that resin production due to external stimuli may be more responsive in stem of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic>. The 
 <italic class="italic">AsCOI1</italic> gene is responsive toward early treatment of MeJA, mechanical wounding and heat stress. The application of MeJA in 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> has increased the expression level of 17 wound signaling-related genes, including TFs 
 <italic class="italic">WRKY4</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">MYB4</italic>, protein kinases 
 <italic class="italic">CAPK</italic>s, 
 <italic class="italic">MAPK</italic>s and 
 <italic class="italic">MAPKK</italic>, NADPH oxidase 
 <italic class="italic">noxB</italic> and some regulators related to signal molecules MeJA, ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) producing NADPH oxidase noxB was found to be significantly up-regulated by the MeJA treatment (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gong et al., 2017</xref>), which is consistent with the findings that MeJA triggers H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production in plants (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Orozco-Cardenas et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hung et al., 2006</xref>). A study on suspension cultures of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> revealed that H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can induce the programmed cell death (PCD) and sesquiterpene synthesis by the elevated expression of 
 <italic class="italic">ASS</italic> genes due to the endogenous accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression of jasmonate-responsive key sesquiterpene synthase 
 <italic class="italic">ASS1</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">A. sinensis</italic> was described to be regulated by a TF AsMYC2 (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu Y. H. et al., 2017</xref>). As an immediate-early responsive gene toward MeJA treatment, AsMYC2 binds to the 
 <italic class="italic">ASS1</italic> promoter containing a G-box motif to initiate the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">ASS1</italic>. Similarly, the homolog of AsMYC2 in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> (MYC2) was shown to be MeJA-responsive and up-regulated the expression of two sesquiterpene synthases (
 <italic class="italic">TPS11</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TPS21</italic>) upon treatment (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hong et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, MeJA treatment has successfully induced the synthesis of 3 sesquiterpenes, that are α-guaiene, α-humulene and δ-guaiene in 
 <italic class="italic">A. crassna</italic> cell culture (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ito et al., 2005</xref>;
