 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family of angiosperms, which is endemic to the Indomalayan realm. To date, there is a total of 21 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species which have been documented and 13 of them are recognized as the agarwood-producing species (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee and Mohamed, 2016</xref>). The destructive exploitation of agarwood, however, has badly affected the wild population of all 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> species. As a consequence, the genus is now listed as endangered species and protected under Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulation due to a drastic declination of the species in the wild (Convention On International Trade In Endangered Species [CITES], 2004; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee and Mohamed, 2016</xref>). High demand of quality agarwood in conjunction with the depletion of the wild 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees implied that the price of the agarwood will continue to soar. As an alternative, mass cultivation and large plantation of 
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria</italic> trees which serve as a sustainable source to obtain agarwood have greatly resolved the shortage of agarwood supply in the global market.
