<p id="Par16" class="p">Multiple regression equations were derived to determine which of accumulated heavy metal and nutrient contents influenced aphid traits. The method of stepwise forward regression was applied. The equations concerned the relationships between life span, fecundity, as well as intrinsic growth rate and the estimated and accumulated nutrients (calcium, potassium, iron, magnesium) and heavy metals: copper, manganese, nickel, lead, zinc, cadmium. Regression equations were derived for three generations of aphids.</p>
