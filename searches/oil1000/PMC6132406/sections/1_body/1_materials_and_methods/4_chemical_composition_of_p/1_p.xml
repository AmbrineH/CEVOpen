<p id="Par14" class="p">In order to determine the nutrients (phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron) and heavy metal (copper, manganese, nickel, lead, zinc, cadmium) concentrations in plant parts, plant material was cleaned of any patches of deposited aphid honeydew and other surface contaminants, washed in tap, next in distilled water. It was then dried at 105 °C for 48 h. A portion of 0.25 g dried plant material was digested with 5 ml of HNO

The quality of the analytical procedure was checked using a reference material (Certified Reference Material CTA-OTL-1 Oriental Tobacco Leaves) with the same quantities of samples. Nitrogen and sulphur contents were determined in a Variomax CNS analyser. The analyses were performed separately for roots, and for shoots and leaves (defined jointly as aboveground parts), and for grain. The following indicators were calculated: K/(Ca + Mg), Ca/Mg, N/S, representing ratios between selected nutrients in plants.
