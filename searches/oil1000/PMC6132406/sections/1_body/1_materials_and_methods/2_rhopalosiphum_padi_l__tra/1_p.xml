<p id="Par7" class="p">Aphids were inoculated on plants in early June using cylindrical cages (12 cm diameter × 20 cm height) made of closely woven airy fabric placed on winter wheat leaves. The cages were attached to the leaves and hermetically closed on both sides in order to avoid the escape of aphids. The investigations were conducted on 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> individuals from the own culture of the Agricultural Environment Protection Department maintained on the same host plant, i.e. winter wheat, Batuta c.v. Three wingless aphid females were placed in each cage and removed completely once they gave birth to the first larvae. One larva was left in each cage. After it reached sexual maturity, its fecundity was determined every day, while newborn larvae were removed each time except the first one, which was transferred immediately to new cage in order to determine the demographic indicators of subsequent generation. One cage was placed on each test plant to investigate the life history of the first generation (40 cages in total for treatment) to ensure the right final number of females to study the aphid life history of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic>. This procedure was applied because some females initially placed on the host plant (using a brush) died before giving birth to the larvae. Cages used to monitor the second and third generation were placed on the subsequent leaves of winter wheat plants, adopting the rule that it should always be on leaves from the same foliage level of the plant in each treatment and generation analysed. Aphid life span and fecundity were assessed for 25 females of each generation and treatment. The population intrinsic growth rate was calculated using the formula developed by Wyatt and White (1977):
