<p id="Par3" class="p">The effects of PDSs on the growth and development of plants and other living things exposed directly to the contact with pollutants are relatively well known, but there is little information available on the topic of indirect effects of these compounds from polluted soil through plants to herbivores. Moreover, the studies to date point to the high usefulness of such traits as fecundity, life span, and other developmental parameters in invertebrates as sensitive indicators of the condition of the environment (Cortet et al.

Both adult individuals and larvae puncture leaves, shoots, flowers, and other vegetative and generative organs, subsequently sucking the juices, which leads to the yellowing, withering, and death of plants. Furthermore, these pests are vector of many dangerous viral diseases (Hansen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2008</xref>; Sadeghi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2009</xref>). In recent years, as a result of many simplified cultivation practices, as well as with the favourable climatic conditions, an increased significance of the bird cherry-oat aphid (
 <italic class="italic">Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> L.) in farmland cultivars is noted. It pertains to the changes in the development of this pest and with the emergence of new anholocyclic forms which transfer the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) (Hu et al.
