<p id="Par4" class="p">The aim of the study was to establish the effect of different concentrations of petroleum-derived substances, such as petrol, diesel fuel, and spent engine oil on the life history traits of three generations of aphids 
 <italic class="italic">Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> L. feeding on winter wheat. Furthermore, the effect of above-mentioned substances on the growth of the host plant, content of selected nutrients and heavy metals in its organs was investigated. The research sought to determine whether soil contamination may affect organisms indirectly exposed to pollution and on the further links of the food chain. It was also attempted to determine the aphidsâ€™ usefulness as bio-indicator of oil pollution in the environment.
