   <p id="Par46" class="p">All of the applied petroleum-derived substances have a generally adverse effect on the developmental parameters in bird cherry-oat aphid, resulting in the decrease of its fecundity, shortening its average life span, and most often also causing the lowering of the population intrinsic growth rate.</p>

   <p id="Par47" class="p">PDSs caused the limitation of growth in wheat plants; whereas, changes in nutrient contents and heavy metals depended on the part of the plant analysed, the substance applied, and on its dose. The negative relationships between the contents of both some macro-elements (Ca, K, P) and heavy metals (Mn, Cd, Cu, and Zn) and the developmental parameters of particular generations of

   <p id="Par48" class="p">Obtained results indicate that soil contamination with PDSs entails far-reaching changes in organisms indirectly exposed to these pollutants, i.e. herbivores, and as a result, it may also adversely affect the further links of the food chain, i.e. for predators and parasitoids.</p>

   <p id="Par49" class="p">The high susceptibility of 
    <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> to the presence of PDSs in the substrate for the host plant should be emphasisedâ€”the clear-cut changes in the life span and fecundity, with relatively small changes in the chemical composition of the plant, constitute an evident indication that the developmental parameters of aphids have the potential for the use as bio-indicator to evaluate the state of the environment contaminated by PDSs.
