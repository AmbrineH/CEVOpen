<p id="Par30" class="p">The changes in the bionomics of bird cherry-oat aphid could be the result of the changes in the nutritive value of host plants under the effect of PDSs, as well as of the presence of harmful substances in tissues resulting from their transfer from contaminated soil. The PDSs contribute to the weakening the growth and development of cultivated plants, and they also modify the contents of macro- and micro-components in these plants, which can lead to the worsening in the quality of fodder for the herbivores (i.e. via decreased content of protein and chlorophyll) (Nadg√≥rska-Socha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2005</xref>). Aphids feed by piercing the phloem of their food plant and are very sensitive to changes in plant quality (Omacini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2001</xref>). On high quality plants, the aphids produced the most offspring and were characterised by a higher population intrinsic growth rate (Stadler et al.
