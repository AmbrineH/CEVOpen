Again, in the experiment presented in our study, no beneficial effect of increased nitrogen content in the aboveground parts of wheat plants brought about by the presence of petrol in substrate was noted on the developmental parameters of bird cherry-oat aphid. Moon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">1995</xref>) also reported that varying nitrogen levels did not affect the duration of pre-reproductive period, reproductive period, and the longevity of another aphid species feeding on wheat—
