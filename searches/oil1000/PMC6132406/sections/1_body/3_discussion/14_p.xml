In our experiment, it was only engine oil and petrol in the dose of 9 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> that caused a significant increase of cadmium content in the aboveground parts of plants, without significantly changing the length of pre-reproductive period. It should, nevertheless, be noted that the observed changes in the bionomy of 
 <italic class="italic">A. fabae</italic> were associated with a much higher level of heavy metals in plant tissues than that noted in our experiment. Thus, the cadmium content in plant tissues during the studies by Crawford et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1995</xref>) has increased a few dozen times after this element was supplied to the substrate; whereas, in our experiment, it rose by approx. 50%. However, the multiple regressions showed the interrelations between the Cd content in aboveground parts of plants and the life span, fecundity, and intrinsic growth rate of aphids in their first generation.
