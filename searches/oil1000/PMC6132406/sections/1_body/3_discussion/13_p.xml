 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>) demonstrated that in the conditions of soil polluted with heavy metals, the length of pre-reproductive period in black bean aphid could extend to12.2 days (i.e. more than 5 days longer than in control group) and depended on the kind of metal and on the generation of the analysed pest. In our experiment, the higher doses of PDSs also caused the lengthening of the pre-reproductive period in the first generation of bird cherry-oat aphid by 0.8–1.6 days; however, it did not affect the studied parameter in the subsequent generations of the pest.
