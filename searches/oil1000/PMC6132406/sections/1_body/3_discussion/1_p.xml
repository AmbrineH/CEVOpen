<p id="Par28" class="p">Bird cherry (
 <italic class="italic">Prunus padus</italic>) is the primary host of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic>. Females lay eggs in autumn in the narrow gap between the axillary buds and the stem. After egg hatch, the newly emerged nymphs move to the unfurling bird cherry leaves where they feed and develop. Under favourable conditions, the nymphs develop rapidly into very large light-green mature fundatrices and give rise to a second, wax-covered, generation. Both crowding and poor nutrition induce the appearance of winged emigrants that in May migrate to cereals and grasses and start feeding. In autumn, short day-length induces the appearance of gynoparae on summer hosts. These winged females migrate to bird cherry where senescing leaves provide the aphids with a rich source of food. There they give birth to apterous oviparae. Short day length also induces the somewhat later appearance of winged males on grasses, which migrate to bird cherry where they mate with the oviparae (Delmotte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2002</xref>; Jiménez-Martínez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2004</xref>). In our experiment, only asexual reproduction of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> was investigated. However, given that on cereals can develop to 12 asexual generations, this may involve significant implications both for the whole pest population in a given area, and for its natural enemies.
