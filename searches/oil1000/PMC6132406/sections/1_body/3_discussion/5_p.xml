In the presented experiment, PDSs caused the changes in the content of macroelements depending both on the kind of PDS, its dose, the part of the plant, as well as on the analysed element. Considering the aboveground parts, which are the places where the aphids feed, we more often dealt with the increases in the content of macroelements than with their decreases. Similar increases in the content of some macro- and micro-elements in cereals under the effect of the content of engine oil were also demonstrated by Wyszkowski and Wyszkowska (
