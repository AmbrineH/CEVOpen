<p id="Par39" class="p">The next factor that could affect the bionomics of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> aphids are the toxic substances that get into plants from contaminated soil. The contamination of soil with PDSs leads to the increase in the content of heavy metals in soil (Okonokhua et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2007</xref>; Ujowundu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2011</xref>; Wyszkowski and Sivitskaya 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2012</xref>), and many authors emphasise that the presence of heavy metals in soil can have a very great effect on the development of aphids on the plants, associated with the migration of harmful compounds to the aboveground parts of plants, which are the principal place of feeding by aphids (Görür 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2009</xref>; Gospodarek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>). Moreover, Merrington et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">1997</xref>) found that aphids accumulate more toxic metals in the bodies than their host plants in the tissues. Görür (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2007</xref>) demonstrated that the increase in lead content, and, to a lesser extent, the copper in the host plant contributes to the decrease in fecundity of females, intrinsic growth rate of the population as well as to the lengthening the pre-reproductive period in cabbage aphid (
 <italic class="italic">Brevicoryne brassicae</italic> L.). Also in our experiment, PDSs generally contributed to the increased contents of these heavy metals in the aboveground parts of plants, which is a fact that can partly explain the lowered values of developmental parameters of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic>.
