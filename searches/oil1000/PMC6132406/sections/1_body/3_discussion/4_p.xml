<p id="Par31" class="p">In the presented experiment, the majority of PDSs used had adversely affected the growth of winter wheat; however, that effect was not that obvious as in the case of broad bean in our earlier experiment when the same doses of PDSs had been used (Rusin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2017</xref>). In the case of broad bean, the oils caused almost a twofold decrease in the mass and length of stems, as well as in the number and mass of leaves. In the case of winter wheat, we noted the shortening of the length of stem by approx. 18% and of the length of ear by more than 23%. It suggests somewhat higher resistance of winter wheat to this type of soil-related factor. Despite this fact, as we mentioned earlier, the adverse effect of PDSs towards the development of

 <italic class="italic">A. fabae</italic> on broad bean. It could stem from the species specifics of the herbivore. The high sensitivity of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> to adverse factors derived from host plant was confirmed by Hale et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2003</xref>). These authors demonstrated a significant decrease in the intrinsic growth rate of the population of this aphid species on grasses resulting from the worsened morphological parameters (such as growth or leaf number) under the effect of drought. The adverse effect of PDSs upon the growth and development of cultivated plants was demonstrated by a number of authors (Akinola et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>). This effect could be a result of disturbances in the intake of essential macro- and micro-elements such as magnesium, iron, boron, and manganese, as well as of water (Odjegba and Atebe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2007</xref>). Heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other chemical additives present in PDSs also can inhibit plant growth (Nwaichi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2014</xref>). The PDSs can also block the transportation of substances in plant cells that can contribute to the limited development of vegetative and generative organs (Osuagwu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2013</xref>).
