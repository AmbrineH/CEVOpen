<p id="Par42" class="p">Engine oil in a higher dose and diesel fuel in a lower dose contributed to the increase in the content of copper in aboveground parts of wheat by approx. 30–40%. The twofold increase of the content of this element in the tissues of broad bean was associated with the shortening of development period in 
 <italic class="italic">A. fabae</italic> by approx. 1.1 days and with the increase in reproductive rate by approx. 1.4 progeny per day, although it did not affect the longevity, reproductive period, and the number of progeny per aphid (Crawford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1995</xref>). The changes in the developmental parameters of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> noted in our experiment reached much further, and the negative relationship between the Cu content and the fecundity and intrinsic growth rate was found in the second generation of the pest.
