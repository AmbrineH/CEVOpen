<p id="Par34" class="p">Engine oil and petrol contributed to the elevated contents of phosphorus in the aboveground parts of wheat plants. The data pertaining to the effect of this element on sucking insects is divergent. In their review, Waring and Cobb (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">1992</xref>) stated that phosphorus most often failed to affect sucking insects (48% of studies they analysed) or affect them positively (in approx. 38% of studies). Later studies (Pitan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2000</xref>), however, indicate that this element can also exert the effect in the form of limiting the density of sucking insects. Both the RDA analysis and multiple regression performed showed the adverse effect of P on the fecundity and intrinsic growth rate of the third generation of aphids.
