<p id="Par26" class="p">As in the case of macro-components, the contents of heavy metals in plants caused by the presence of PDSs in soil was variable (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). In general, the applied substances caused the increase in Mn content in aboveground parts and roots of winter wheat, but the decrease in the content of this metal in grain. Engine oil in both doses applied contributed to the increases in Pb and Ni contents in grain and to Pb content in the aboveground parts of plants. The dose of 9 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of this substance led to the decreases in the contents of Cu, Ni, and Pb in plant roots; whereas, the higher dose led to the increase in Cu content in aboveground parts and in grain and to the increase in Zn content in roots. Diesel fuel caused the increase in Zn content in roots but the decrease of its content in grain. The lower dose of this substance led to the increase in Cu and Pb content in aboveground parts, while the higher dose led to the increased content of Cu and Ni in roots and of Pb in grain of winter wheat. Petrol in the dose of 18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> generally caused the decrease in the content of analysed heavy metals (except for Mn and Cd) in plant roots, but also the increase in Ni and Zn contents in grain.
