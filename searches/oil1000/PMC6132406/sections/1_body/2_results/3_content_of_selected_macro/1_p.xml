<p id="Par24" class="p">The effects of PDSs upon the content of nutrients in plants was variable and dependent on the kind of analysed nutrient, dose, and the kind of the substances applied, as well as on the part of plant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). All substances applied in the experiment generally led to a significant increase in nitrogen content in the roots and grain of winter wheat; whereas, the application of petrol also resulted in increases in the contents of this macro-component in the aboveground parts of plants (i.e. in shoots and leaves). Engine oil brought about the significant increases in the contents of P and Ca in the aboveground parts of winter wheat plants as well the increase in Fe content in grain. The higher dose of the substance also led to the increases in K, Mg, and Fe contents in the aboveground parts, and to S, P, and K contents in roots; however, the dose of 9 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> resulted in the decreases of P, Mg, and Fe contents in plant roots. Diesel oil contributed to the increase in Ca content in the aboveground parts and roots of winter wheat, and to the increases in S and P contents in roots. On the other hand, it decreased the Fe content in roots, and—in the lower dose—also led to the decreases in S, K, and Ca contents in grain; whereas, in the dose of 18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> led to the decrease in S and Fe contents in the aboveground parts of plants. The lower dose of petrol resulted in the increases of S, P, K, and Ca contents in the aboveground parts and roots; whereas, the dose of this substance amounting to 18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> contributed to the decreases in the contents of all analysed nutrients (except for N) in roots, and to the decrease in Ca and Mg contents in aboveground parts.
