<p id="Par25" class="p">PDSs applied in the experiment had generally caused an increase in the value of Ca/Mg ratio in aboveground parts of winter wheat, as well as in roots, but also decreased its value in the grain of plants (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Engine oil was applied at the higher dose, and the diesel fuel in both doses applied led to the drop in the value of K/(Ca + Mg) ratio in aboveground parts, although they most often did not affect the value of the analysed ratio in other organs of plants. All xenobiotics caused the increased in the value of N/S ratio in the grain of plants, while diesel fuel and petrol in higher doses also caused the increase in its value in aboveground parts.
