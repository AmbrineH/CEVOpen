<p id="Par27" class="p">The first and second ordination axes explain the similar percentage of variation, dividing the samples into three sets (A, G, R). The potassium content was the most correlated with the first ordination axis whereas the Mg, P, and Ca contents—with the second ordination axis. The highest Mg concentrations were found in G samples. In turn, the highest contents of Cu, Mn, Fe, Pb, Ni, and Zn were found in R samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Multiple regressions revealed that Mn and Cd had negative effects on life span, fecundity, and the intrinsic growth rate of aphids in the first generation of aphids (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In the second generation, Ca had an adverse effect on the studied parameters, and Cu and K also had adverse effects on the fecundity and intrinsic growth rate of aphids. The developmental parameters of the third generation of aphids were adversely affected by Ca, while additionally, the negative effect was exerted by Zn on the life span and fecundity. It was also the P content in plants which had the adverse effect on the fecundity and the intrinsic growth rate in this generation. The above relationships were also confirmed by RDA analysis (Fig.
