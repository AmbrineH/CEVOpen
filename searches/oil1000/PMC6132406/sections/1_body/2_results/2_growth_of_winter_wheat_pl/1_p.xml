<p id="Par23" class="p">Irrespective of the dose, the contamination of soil with diesel fuel affected the growth of winter wheat plants, resulting in the significant decrease in plant height, ear length, as well as the length and mass of stem, and the number and mass of grains in the ear (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Similar regularities were also observed in the object contaminated with the higher dose of engine oil. The plants growing on soil contaminated with petrol in 18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> dose had significantly shorter stems than that in control plants, as well as a lower number and mass of grains in the ear. The lower dose of petrol decreased only the number of grains per ear. With the increased dose of the xenobiotic applied, its negative effect on the analysed morphological parameters of plants had most often increased as well.
