 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> dose, assumed zero value for the third generation of pest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Compared with the control object, diesel fuel in both doses applied caused a significant decrease in the population intrinsic growth rate in all generation of the aphid. In the case of engine oil, a similar relationship was noted, except for the second generation and the lower dose of this xenobiotic. In turn, petrol had generally no significant effects upon the analysed parameter (except for the third generation and the higher dose of this substance).
