<p id="Par18" class="p">Compared with the control plants, both engine oil and diesel fuel in two doses applied resulted in a significant shortening of life span in three studied generations of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> feeding on the plants growing on contaminated soil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Similar regularities were also noted in the case of an object polluted with petrol, albeit only after the higher dose of this substance (18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) had been applied. In line with the increase in the content of particular xenobiotics in soil, the negative effects of the analysed parameter also intensified, and the statistically significant differences between objects with particular doses of PDSs were noted in the first- and second- generations after applying diesel fuel, and in the first generation after applying petrol. In all analysed objects (including the control), the life spans of aphids decreased with time and with the emerging generation of the pest.
