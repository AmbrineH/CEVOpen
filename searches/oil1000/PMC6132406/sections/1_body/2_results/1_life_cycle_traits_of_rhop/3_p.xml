 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> fell in the range from 9.5 to 11.1 days for the first generation, from 9.0 to 10.2 days for the second generation, and from 8.9 to 9.8 days for the third generation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Higher doses of PDSs (18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) resulted in a significant lengthening of the pre-production period in first-generation females; however, no such relationships were noted in the remaining generation of the pest. Both doses of diesel fuel used, as well as a dose of engine oil amounting to 18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, completely inhibited the process of giving birth to larvae in the third-generation females.
