<p id="Par19" class="p">Applying PDSs resulted in a significant reduction in fecundity in all generations of 
 <italic class="italic">R. padi</italic> females in both doses used (except for the lower dose of petrol in the first generation of the pest) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The most detrimental effects on the analysed parameter were exerted by engine oil and diesel fuel in the dose of 18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which caused the reduction in the fecundity of the first- and second-generation females by more than 90% and completely inhibited the process of giving birth to larvae in the case of third generation. Similarly as in the previously analysed case, the fecundity of aphids decreased in the subsequent generations.
