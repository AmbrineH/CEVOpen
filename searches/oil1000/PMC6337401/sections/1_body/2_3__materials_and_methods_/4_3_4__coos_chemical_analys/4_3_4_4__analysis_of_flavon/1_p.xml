<p class="p">All reagents were of the highest purity and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). Water was of Milli Q grade. All solvents and water were accurately degassed before use in the analyses. Analysis of flavonoids was performed by RP-HPLC (Waters S.p.A, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy). Twenty microliters of phenolic extract were injected into a model 515 HPLC system (Waters S.p.A, Sesto San Giovanni, Milan, Italy) fitted with a 4.6 mm × 250 mm Prodigy ODS column (Phenomenex, Bologna, Italy). A Waters 2487 dual λ UV-visible detector was set at 360 nm. Chromatogram analysis was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Identification of the free flavonoids was performed by co-chromatography on HPLC with authentic standards. Quantification was achieved using standard curves in the range of 10–200 ng of a standard mixture containing luteolin-7-
