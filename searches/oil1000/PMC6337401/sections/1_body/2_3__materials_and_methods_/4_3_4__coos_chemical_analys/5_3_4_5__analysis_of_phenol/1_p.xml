<p class="p">Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed by RP-HPLC at the chromatographic conditions previously reported [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The identity of the phenolic alcohols, aldehyde as well as free phenolic acids was confirmed by chromatography with authentic standards, and quantification was performed using a standard curve in the range 0.1−0.5 μg of standard mixtures containing hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, vanillin, gallic, protocatechuic, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, chlorogenic, vanillic, caffeic, syringic, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric, ferulic, and rosmarinic acids. Chromatogram analysis was performed as previously reported for flavonoid determination.
