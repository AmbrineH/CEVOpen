<p class="p">The antioxidant capacity of the phenolic extracts from the flavoured oil samples was performed following the method previously described [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], using the radical cation ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). The radical solution was prepared as previously described [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], and a Trolox dose-response curve in the 0.2–1.5 mM range was used. The antioxidant activity was expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) per mL of extract.
