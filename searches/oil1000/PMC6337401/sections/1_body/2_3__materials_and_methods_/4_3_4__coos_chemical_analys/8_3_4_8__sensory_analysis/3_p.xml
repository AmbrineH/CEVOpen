<p class="p">Using the proposed sheet, it was possible to obtain a sensory profile of the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs on the basis of (i) the first order descriptors of colour, flavouring and taste and of (ii) the hedonic parameter related to the evolutionary state and overall pleasantness. Particular attention was paid to the perception of some smell parameters related to citrus fruits (i.e., lemon, orange, candied fruit). Differently from the International Olive Council [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] guidelines, which provide for the use of a dark-coloured glass, we used a transparent glass in order to better evaluate the colour of the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs as the peel of the citrus fruit could differently influence the final colour of the final product. The panellists ranked the flavoured oil samples on a scale from 0 (no perception, the lowest intensity) to 9 (the highest intensity) to evaluate the intensity of each parameter. The tasting was carried out in the conditions previously described [
