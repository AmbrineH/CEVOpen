<p class="p">Peel hydrodistillations were performed on fresh material in a Clevenger apparatus equipped with an electric mantle heater for 2 h. Each extraction was performed in triplicate. For the peels, after the albedo removal, the flavedo was roughly cut and hydrodistilled. After the removal of the branches, leaves were roughly cut and hydrodistilled. Furthermore, 5.0 g for each peel sample were manually squeezed in a glass vial containing 1 mL of HPLC grade 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. Immediately after each distillation, 1 Î¼L of essential oil was injected after dilution in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane HPLC grade at 5% for each replicate.
