<p class="p">The headspace spontaneous volatile emissions of the two citrus-flavoured olive oils were compared to that of the unflavoured control sample. Triplicates were performed for each sample. For each replicate, 2 mL were put in a glass vial closed with aluminium foil. The equilibration was performed at room temperature for 30 min for all the samples before sampling. Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME, Supelco, St. Louis, MO, USA) devices coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, 100 μm) were used to sampling the headspace of the samples. SPME sampling was performed using the same new fibre, preconditioned according to the manufacturer instructions, for all the analyses. Sampling was accomplished in an air-conditioned room (22 ± 1 °C) to guarantee a stable temperature; sampling time was 3’ for each sample. Once sampling was finished, the fibre was withdrawn into the needle and transferred to the injection port of the GC-MS system. The desorption conditions were identical for all the samples (

Furthermore, blanks were performed before each first SPME extraction, and randomly repeated during each series. Quantitative comparisons of relative peaks areas were performed between the same chemicals in the different samples.
