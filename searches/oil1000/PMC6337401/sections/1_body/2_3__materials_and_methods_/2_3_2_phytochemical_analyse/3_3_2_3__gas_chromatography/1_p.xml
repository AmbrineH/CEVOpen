<p class="p">The GC/EI-MS analyses were performed with a CP-3800 apparatus (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion-trap mass detector (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). The oven temperature was programmed rising from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; injector temperature, 220 °C; transfer-line temperature, 240 °C; carrier gas, He (1 mL/min). The acquisition parameters were as follows: full scan; scan range: 35–300
