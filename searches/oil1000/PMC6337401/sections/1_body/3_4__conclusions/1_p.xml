<p class="p">Citrus fruit by-products, such as peels, can be further exploited for the extraction of essential oils and for the aromatization of olive oils with the result of typical, added-value products. In fact, the use of cryomacerated 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peels as flavouring agents in the olive oil extraction revealed the ability of this technology to retain the typical aroma notes of these plants in the final product, which showed a complex sensory profile. The technology adopted in the production of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs showed to be also able to enrich oils with functional and bioactive compounds, mostly from citrus peel. Examples are carotenoids, naringenin, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, whose health benefits are more and more recognised. In particular, naringenin, abundantly found in citrus fruit, adds value to the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs, having recently drawn scientific attention for its potential biological activities.
