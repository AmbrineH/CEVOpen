<p class="p">The aim of this research was to produce and characterize, from a chemical and sensory point of view, two citrus-flavoured olive oils (
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs) in comparison with an unflavoured EVOO. 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs were obtained through the direct addition of cryo-macerated citrus peels (from lemon and orange of Massa Carrara province, Tuscany) in the olive mill, together with fresh olives (from Tuscany varieties too) during oil extraction [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Since citrus peel is rich in polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and characterized by the presence of typical essential oils [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], analyses of the main phenolic compounds as well as of the volatile organic compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs were performed. Essential oils of the citrus peels added for 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs production were also investigated.
