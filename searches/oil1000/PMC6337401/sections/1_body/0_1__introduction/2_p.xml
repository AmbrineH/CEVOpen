<p class="p">A strategic line for the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> agro-food sector could be the recovery of its by-products, namely peels and seeds, to be used in the formulation of innovative foods able to combine nutritional and health properties and therefore to meet the changing needs of the consumers. This could ensure the exploitation of all the parts of the fruit, without any waste. In the last few years, the use of by-products of the food industry as natural sources of bioactive compounds has been widely considered, and several studies focused on the development of innovative products [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The enhancement of agricultural by-products could realise a circular economy model, as well as become a driving force for the development of marginal territories. Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a commodity which enjoys particular prestige in the globalized economy and Tuscany contributes also to the Italian production of EVOO with ideal, typical-high quality products, symbolic of consumer trends. “Frantoio” and “Leccino” are famous Tuscan-blend oils with characteristic strong, aromatic, grassy, fruity flavor, strong pungency and with its own spicy character. For these reasons, Tuscan oils have considerable market recognition all over the world. Increased consumption of olive oil, in place of animal-derived fats, has been associated with a reduced incidence of age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer, as well as neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], due to the presence in olive oil of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols. Moreover, the development of new extraction methods based on the production of functional foods enriched with natural antioxidants has been demonstrated to be promising as potential application for the stabilization of olive oil and the increase of its shelf life [
