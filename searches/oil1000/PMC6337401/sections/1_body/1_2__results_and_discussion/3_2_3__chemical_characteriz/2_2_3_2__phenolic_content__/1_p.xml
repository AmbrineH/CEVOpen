<p class="p">The phenolic compounds exhibit a wide range of biological functions, which have been attributed to their free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities. For all the extracted oils (control EVOO and both 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs), the total phenolic contents are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. While both the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs showed a reduced amount of total phenols if compared with control EVOO, they still showed a significant antioxidant activity, combined with a lower Intensity of Bitter. These differences in phenolic profiles can be probably due to the interactions among part of astringent phenolic compounds present in olives with citrus peels during the extraction process. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Furthermore, while both 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs showed similar antioxidant capacity values, concerning the total carotenoid content the results were very different between the two 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs, as the orange one exhibited an almost six time higher value than the lemon 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OO. In fact, the carotenoids are responsible for the external and internal colouration of orange fruits [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], and a large proportion of them was found in the flavedo of the fruits [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] as well. The use of cryomaceration could have favoured the extraction of these compounds, causing their relevant presence in the orange 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OO. The increase in carotenoid content could be considered a very interesting feature, because the serum levels of these compounds are inversely associated with an impaired glucose metabolism: the lower the carotenoids, the worst the glucose intolerance [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Thus, the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs, rich in carotenoids, could represent an important innovative product, as humans are not capable of synthesizing carotenoids which should be exclusively of dietary derivation. Moreover, there is evidence that dietary intake of carotenoids is linked with reduced risks of several chronic health disorders, including heart disease, age-related macular deterioration and certain cancers [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and their actions are related to the capacity of carotenoids to quench reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>].
