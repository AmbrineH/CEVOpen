<p class="p">The study of phenolic acid composition, as well as that of the main phenolic alcohols and aldehydes characterising the profile of EVOO, is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>. Both 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs (lemon and orange) showed values 3-fold higher in the total content of the phenolics investigated in comparison with the EVOO control. More and more interest in phenolic acids arises from their potential protective role, through ingestion of fruit and vegetables, against diseases that may be related to oxidative damage (coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancers) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Besides the health-related and antioxidant properties of foods, phenolic acids have been associated with color and sensory qualities [
