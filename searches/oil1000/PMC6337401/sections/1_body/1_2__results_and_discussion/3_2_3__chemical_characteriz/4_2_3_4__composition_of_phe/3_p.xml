<p class="p">Huge increases in vanillic, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric and ferulic acids contents, although more consistent in 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>OO, could be attributed to citrus peel addition, in agreement with what found in literature about bitter orange [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] where 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric and ferulic acids were the most abundant phenolic compounds representing the 24.7% and 23.8%, respectively, of the peel extract. Bocco et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] reported similar results showing the prevalence of phenolic acids in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits. Since rosmarinic acid was found in the peel and the juice of bitter orange [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], its presence in 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs can be originated by citrus peel addition too. A wide spectrum of beneficial activity for human health has been advocated for these phenolic compounds, at least in part, because of their strong antioxidant activity. In particular, Zang et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] showed that 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid can act as a direct scavenger of reactive oxygen species to prevent lipid peroxidation, whereas Kanski et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] highlighted that the presence of electron donating groups on the benzene ring (3 methoxy and more importantly 4-hydroxyl) of ferulic acid gives to this compound the additional property of terminating free radical chain reactions.
