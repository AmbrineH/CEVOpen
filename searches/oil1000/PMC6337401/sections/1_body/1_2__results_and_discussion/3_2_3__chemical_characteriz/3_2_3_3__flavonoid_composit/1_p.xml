<p class="p">The presence of flavonoids in the olive oil control accounted for 5% of the phenolic content (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>), a percentage 1.6-fold higher in comparison with that of phenolic acids (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Since flavonoids are important natural compounds with different biological activities, among which the antioxidative one, their presence deserves particular attention also in the study of the phenolic profile of EVOO. Flavonoid amounts are affected by many factors such as cultivar, ripening stage and orchard [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]; luteolin was one of the main flavonoids detected in the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OO extract (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>), according to literature [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The other main flavonoid was kaempferol, which accounted for 39% of the flavonoid content, whereas luteolin-7-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-glucoside, rutin, quercetin-3-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-glucoside, apigenin-7-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-glucoside, quercitrin, quercetin-3-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-glucuronide and quercetin were the less represented (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The extraction procedure differently affected flavonoid composition of control and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs. Luteolin was detected in high amounts also in 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>OO more enriched with luteolin-7-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-glucoside and lutein (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Notwithstanding a general decrease was observed in the other flavonoid compounds, the flavonoid profile of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs was characterized by the presence of naringenin (26 and 22% of flavonoid content in 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>OO and 
 <italic class="italic">Cs</italic>OO, respectively). This flavanone, originated from citrus peel addition [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], adds value to 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs. In fact, naringin and its aglycone naringenin belong to citrus flavonoids, which displayed strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. An increasing amount of research suggests that naringin supplementation is beneficial for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Moreover, naringin and naringenin exhibited an important role in the oxidative stress protection, being both strong scavengers of free radicals and preventing lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Thus, the presence of naringenin can endow 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs with healthy properties as well as preserve them from lipid degradation, increasing their shelf-life.
