<p class="p">The complete composition of headspace volatile emissions of the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs and of the unflavoured olive oil control sample is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The spontaneous volatile emission of the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>OOs was drastically altered compared to the control. The latter, indeed, mainly emitted non-terpene compounds: they accounted for up to 92.0% of its total headspace emission, of which over 80% was represented by (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-hexenal. The relative abundance of the latter decreased almost to trace amounts in the flavoured samples, which exhibited volatile emissions dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons: 99.1% for the 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>OO (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus limon</italic> olive oil), 98.3% for the 
 <italic class="italic">Cs</italic>OO (
 <italic class="italic">Citrus sinensis</italic> olive oil). The most relevant contributions to these headspaces retraced the composition of the manually squeezed volatile fraction of the citrus peels. Limonene accounted for more than 65% of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cl</italic>OO headspace, followed by β-pinene (13.6%) and γ-terpinene (8.1%). For the 
 <italic class="italic">Cs</italic>OO, limonene dominated the volatile emission, with a relative abundance &gt;90%; myrcene and sabinene followed, accounting for 3.0 and 1.5%, respectively.
