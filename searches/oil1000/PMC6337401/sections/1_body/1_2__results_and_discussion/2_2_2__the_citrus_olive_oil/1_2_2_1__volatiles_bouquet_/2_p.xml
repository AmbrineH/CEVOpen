<p class="p">The persistence of the same compounds detected in the manually squeezed volatile fractions of the citrus peels confirmed the capacity of the cryomaceration technology to retain the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the final product. It avoided the thermal degradation of the VOCs, which were released in the oil: the lipophilic nature of the latter trapped the aromatic notes, which conferred a more complex bouquet to the final product. The unflavoured olive oil headspace was dominated by the sweet and fruity note [
