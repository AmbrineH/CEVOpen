<p class="p">The complete compositions of the EOs and the extraction yields of the lemon peels are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Six compounds were identified in the volatile fraction obtained by manual squeezing of the lemon flavedo, all belonging to the monoterpene hydrocarbon chemical class. Limonene represented over 70% of the total composition, followed by β-pinene (14.9%) and γ-terpinene (9.6%). All the compounds found in this volatile fraction were also detected in the flavedo hydrodistilled EO, in which 33 compounds were identified. The hydrodistilled lemon flavedo EO was dominated (over 75%) by monoterpene hydrocarbons, and the most abundant compounds were the same of the manually squeezed volatile fraction: limonene (50.2%), β-pinene (10.6%) and γ-terpinene (9.6%). Oxygenated monoterpenes accounted for 20.1%: geranial (7.1%) and neral (5.7%) showed the highest relative abundances, and their correlated alcohols were detected as well, but in lower relative quantities (0.8%). Only 3 compounds were exclusively found in this EO among all those extracted from the lemon samples, but all in a relative abundance lower than 0.5%.
