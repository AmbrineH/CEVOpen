<p class="p">The complete composition of the EOs and the extraction yields of the orange samples is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00065-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The manually squeezed orange volatile fraction was dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons (over 98%), among which limonene was the most abundant (91.4%), followed by sabinene (3.2%) and myrcene (2.6%). Among the 10 compounds detected in this EO, only octanaland (E)-Î²-ocimene were not shared with the flavedo hydrodistilled EO, characterized by the presence of 17 different compounds. The hydrodistilled orange flavedo EO was dominated (over 90%) by monoterpene hydrocarbons, and the most abundant compound was the same of the manually squeezed volatile fraction: limonene (85.7%). Other compounds present at significant amounts were represented by sabinene (1.9%), myrcene (2.2%), octanal (2.0%) and linalool (3.5%). In contrast with lemon, oxygenated monoterpenes of orange EO accounted only for 5.6% in favour of an increased presence of limonene.
