<p class="p">The hypocholesterolemic activity of APNO can be related to the concentrations of MUFAs (30.74%) since a reduction in serum cholesterol levels is amongst the major beneficial effects of the intake of this class of fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This effect was also observed in rats [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and humans [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] fed diets rich in oleic (MUFA), linoleic, and Î±-linolenic (PUFAs) acids. The chemical constituents of the APNO are probably responsible for the hypocholesterolemic activity observed.
