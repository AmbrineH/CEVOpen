<p class="p">The liver mass of the HFD + APNO group was higher when compared to the control and HFD groups (

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], an excessive consumption of SAFAs can injure the hepatocytes, releasing large amounts of the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymes in the bloodstream, which indicates their toxicity. In the present study, neither the liver enzymes AST and ALT nor the serum creatinine was changed by the treatment with APNO as compared to the HFD controls (
