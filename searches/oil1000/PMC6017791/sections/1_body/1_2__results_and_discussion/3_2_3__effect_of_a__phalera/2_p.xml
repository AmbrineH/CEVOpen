 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] showed that the intake of coconut oil, which is rich in lauric acid, promotes the reduction of abdominal fat in obese women. Thus, the effect of APNO in reducing adiposity may be related to the presence of the oleic, linoleic, α-linolenic, and lauric fatty acids, considering their ability to alter the lipid metabolism and reduce the fat content.
