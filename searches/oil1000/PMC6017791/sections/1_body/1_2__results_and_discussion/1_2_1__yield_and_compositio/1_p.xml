<p class="p">The yield of nut oil extracted from APNO was 29.91%. Mechanical pressing results in partial removal of the nut oil, with lower oil retrieval when compared to the extraction with organic solvents. However, in terms of food safety, the oil extracted by pressing is of better quality than the solvent-extracted oil, due to the absence of chemical residues in both the oil and the flour, a byproduct generated after oil extraction that can be used for food for both humans and animals.</p>
