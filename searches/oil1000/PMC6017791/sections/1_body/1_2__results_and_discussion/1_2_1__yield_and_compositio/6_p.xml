<p class="p">Linoleic acid, present in APNO (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00960-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) is described as hypocholesterolemic and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. It is an essential fatty acid since it cannot be synthesized by the body [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and thus, it is indispensable to obtain it from natural food sources. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the daily intake of linoleic acid should range between 2.5–9%, and thus, APNO could be an alternative source of linoleic acid in the daily dietary recommendations. Of the polyunsaturated class of fatty acids, α-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) is easily found in foods of animal and plant origin, but in limited quantities [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. It regulates the oxidation of fatty acids by inhibiting lipid synthesis [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease [
