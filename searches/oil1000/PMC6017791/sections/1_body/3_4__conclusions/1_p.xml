<p class="p">This study showed that the 
 <italic class="italic">A. phalerata</italic> nut oil administrated in hyperlipidemic rats induced by a high-fructose diet led to a reduction in body mass and in the mesenteric white adipose tissue, as well as having a hypocholesterolemic effect, possibly mediated by the increased body temperature and elimination of water and lipids in the feces. The beneficial effects were probably due to the action of the oleic, lauric, and linoleic fatty acids, which are the main fatty acids in APNO. Thus, the 
 <italic class="italic">A. phalerata</italic> nut oil has a potential use as a functional food and nutritional supplement for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and metabolic alterations related to obesity.
