<p class="p">The fatty acid profile of APNO was analyzed on a gas chromatograph, model 3900 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), equipped with a split injection port, CP-Sil 88 capillary column (100 m × 0.25 mm id, 0.2 µm thickness), and a flame ionization detector (FID). The fatty acids were prepared by transmethylation, as described in [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-00960" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], using an ammonium chloride solution and sulfuric acid in methanol as the esterifying agent. The operating conditions of the gas chromatograph (GC) were as follows: 270 °C injector temperature, 310 °C detector temperature, oven temperature programming ramp: 140 °C for 2 min, heating from 140 to 235 °C (2.5 °C·min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and remaining at 235 °C for 10 min. The injections were performed using hydrogen as the carrier gas at 13.7 psi. Fatty acid peaks were identified by comparison with retention times of fatty acid methyl ester standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Bellefont, PA, USA) (Supelco
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 37 Component FAME Mix Bell); Linolenic acid methyl ester (C18: 3 w3), Cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid methyl ester (C22: 5 w3), and Conjugated linoleic acid methyl ester (CLA), and the quantification was performed by normalized areas. The results were expressed as g·100 g
