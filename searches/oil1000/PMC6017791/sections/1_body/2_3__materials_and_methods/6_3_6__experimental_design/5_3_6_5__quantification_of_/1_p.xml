After this, the samples were inserted in cellulose cartridges that were later placed in contact with hexane (P.A.) in the Soxhlet apparatus, and maintained under boiling conditions for 2 h. The lipid content of the sample was determined gravimetrically after the total evaporation of the solvent in an oven with air circulation at 105 °C. The analyses were carried out in triplicate.
