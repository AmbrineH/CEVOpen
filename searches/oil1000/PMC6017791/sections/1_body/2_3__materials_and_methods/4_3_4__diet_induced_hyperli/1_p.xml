<p class="p">A high-fructose diet (HFD) was prepared by mixing 34% of a commercial rodent diet (Presence) with 66% fructose. Both diets (HFD and commercial chow) were analyzed as follows: the lipid levels by the Soxhlet method; the fixed mineral residue by incineration in a muffle furnace at 550 °C; protein content by the Kjeldahl method; and moisture content by removing the water in the air circulating oven (105 °C) until a constant weight, according to the AOAC [
