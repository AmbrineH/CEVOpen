  <p class="p">Phylogenetic tree of partial 16S rDNA gene sequence from 
   <italic class="italic">Artemisia sieberi</italic> witchesâ€™ broom phytoplasma isolates (marked in bold) and selected phytoplasma reference sequences. GenBank accession numbers are shown in brackets, and 16Sr groups are annotated to the right. 
   <italic class="italic">Acholeplasma laidlawii</italic> was used as outgroup to root the tree. The tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6 software. The bar indicates the number of nucleotides substitution per site. Bootstrap values are shown at nodes with greater than 50% support.
