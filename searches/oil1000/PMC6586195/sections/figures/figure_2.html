 <p> Phylogenetic tree of partial 16S rDNA gene sequence from Artemisia sieberi witchesâ€™ broom phytoplasma isolates (marked in bold) and selected phytoplasma reference sequences. GenBank accession numbers are shown in brackets, and 16Sr groups are annotated to the right. Acholeplasma laidlawii was used as outgroup to root the tree. The tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6 software. The bar indicates the number of nucleotides substitution per site. Bootstrap values are shown at nodes with greater than 50% support. </p>
