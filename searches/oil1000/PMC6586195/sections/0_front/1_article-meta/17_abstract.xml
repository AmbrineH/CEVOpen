  <italic class="italic">Artemisia sieberi</italic> showing symptoms resembling those caused by phytoplasma were observed in Geno Mountain, Hormozgan Province, Iran, and were examined for phytoplasma presence by PCR assays. In addition, the essential oils hydrodistilled from the aerial parts of phytoplasma-infected and healthy plants have been analyzed and compared by GC and GC/MS. Phylogenetic and virtual RFLP analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the phytoplasma associated with 
  <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> witches’ broom (AsWB) was a strain of ‘
  <italic class="italic">Candidatus</italic> Phytoplasma aurantifolia’. The presence of the disease, however, induced a further enrichment (from 4.9 to 45.2%, a relative increase of 90%) of the entire monoterpene class as compared to the abundance in healthy samples. Conversely, a matching decrease in monoterpenoid (from 48.7 to 2%, a relative decrease of 90.2%) was observed in the infected plants. Besides the first report of phytoplasma infection of 
  <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic>, the changes of its essential oils are reported.
