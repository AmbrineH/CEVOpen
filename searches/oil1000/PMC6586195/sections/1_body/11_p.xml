<p class="p">In addition, camphor which had the highest value among all component, was increased in infected plants. Camphor is believed to be toxic and is thus sometimes used as a repellent to insects, antimicrobial substance and used for mummification. Many researchers demonstrated that the insecticidal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> is due to camphor. For example, 
 <xref rid="b18-ppj-35-274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Negahban et al. (2006)</xref> conducted a research and reported that the insecticidal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> is related to camphor compared with other component. Like the above hypothesis, to reach high amount of this component, we can artificially infect the plants and get more such component to be used in pesticides.
