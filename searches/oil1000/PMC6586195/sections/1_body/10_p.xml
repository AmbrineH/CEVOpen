<p class="p">The effect of phytoplasma infection on chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> was studied. The component which increased drastically in infected plants was thujone. Thujone is a ketone and a monoterpene that occurs naturally in two diastereomeric (epimeric) forms: α-thujone and β-thujone. It has a menthol odor (

Thujone acts on GABA as an antagonist (opposite to the effects of alcohol) and as a component of several essential oils, is also used in perfumery. There are controversial findings on the effects of phytoplasma infection on chemical composition of medicinal plants. Some authors indicated that phytoplasma infection could increase specific components like sesquiterpenes, esters and alkaloids (

 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> cultivated plants. So, we could reinforce a hypothesis that artificial infection could yield a high amount of thujone which can be used in pesticides and perfumery. However, the phytopathological status of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> propagation material must be carefully controlled and such controls should be included in the guidelines for good agricultural practice.
