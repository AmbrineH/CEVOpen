 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> (5 symptomatic and 5 asymptomatic) were collected at full flowering stage. The collected plant was dried naturally on laboratory benches at room temperature (23–27°C) for 5 days until it was crisp dry. Essential oil was extracted by a hydrodistillation method using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 4 h. Analysis the oils was carried out using gas chromatography GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS were conducted on an HP 6890 GC system coupled with 5973 network mass selective detectors with a capillary column of HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature program was initiated at 60°C, held for 1 min, and then raised to 245°C at a rate of 3°C/min held isothermally for 10 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The detector and injector temperatures were 250 and 230°C, respectively. The sample was injected by splitting and the split ratio was 1:100. The quadruple mass spectrometer in electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV and an interface temperature of 250°C was scanned over the 40–500 m/z. Retention indices were calculated for all components using a homologous series of alkanes injected in conditions equal to those of the samples and by computer search using the libraries of Wiley275.L and Wiley7n.1, as well as by comparisons of their fragmentation pattern in mass spectra with published ones in the literatures (
