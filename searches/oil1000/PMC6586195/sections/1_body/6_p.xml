<p class="p">The expected sizes of 1.8 and 1.25 kb of 16S rDNA were amplified from all symptomatic plants and the positive control, respectively, but not from the asymptomatic plants. Consequently, the plants were confirmed to be infected by a phytoplasma. The pathogen associated with 
 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> witches’ broom was designated as 
 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> Witches’ broom (AsWB) phytoplasma. Compared against the NCBI database using the BLASTn tool, the derived sequence was 99% identical with 
 <italic class="italic">Zinnia elegans</italic> phyllody phytoplasma (KY501142), Alfalfa witches’ broom phytoplasma (KT634120), 
 <italic class="italic">Cosmos bipinnatus</italic> phyllody phytoplasma (MF186858), all of which were ‘
 <italic class="italic">Ca</italic>. P. aurantifolia’-related strains. Therefore, we concluded that the AsWB phytoplasma was a ‘
 <italic class="italic">Ca</italic>. P. aurantifolia’-related strain. A phylogenetic tree constructed was in accordance with the outcome of BLAST analysis and the sequence from present study was clustered in group 16SrII (
