<p class="p">Based on symptoms and positive PCR reaction with universal phytoplasma primers, the AsWB is associated with a strain of “
 <italic class="italic">Candidatus</italic> Phytoplasma aurantifolia”. In Iran, group16SrII phytoplasmas have been identified in association with many diseases such as witches’ broom disease of lime (WBDL), cabbage yellow, clover little leaf, alfalfa witches’ broom, tomato witches’ broom, sunflower phyllody, cucumber and squash phyllody, carrot witches’ broom, parsley witches’ broom, pomegranate little leaf, bell pepper big bud and elegant zinnia phyllody (

 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> has not been reported yet, the association between other 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia</italic> species and phytoplasmas has been previously studied. For example, 
 <xref rid="b15-ppj-35-274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meneguzzi et al. (2008)</xref> indicated that A
 <italic class="italic">. annua</italic> was infected by Ash yellows group in Argentina. In addition, 
 <xref rid="b17-ppj-35-274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mori et al. (2015)</xref> reported that 16SXII-A was associated with 
 <italic class="italic">A. vulgaris</italic> in Italy. Recently, the assoiation between stolbur group (16SXII-A) and 
 <italic class="italic">A. scoparia</italic> was reported in China (
 <xref rid="b26-ppj-35-274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of association of 16SII-D phytoplasma with 
 <italic class="italic">A. sieberi</italic> in Iran and may be in the world. Further studies are required to find the insect vector of this phytoplasma.
