<p id="Par24" class="p">Micrographs were acquired using either a Leica DCF300FX digital camera coupled to a Leica MZ16F dissecting microscope (436/20 nm excitation 480/40 nm emission, 470/40 nm excitation, 510 nm long pass emission and 525/50 nm emission, 10x zoom) and controlled with Leica FireCam Software or a Leica DM2500 compound microscope coupled with a Q-Imaging Micropublisher 3.3 camera, controlled with Q-Capture software. All prepared samples were imaged prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Selected sorted samples which were to be subjected to SEM imaging were placed onto a Nuclepore
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> polycarbonate filter and washed three times with 10 ml milli-Q H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O to remove any residue of PBS that would cause salt crystals to form on the Nuclepore
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> filter. The resultant filter paper was placed onto an SEM stub and sputter coated (Q150T-ES, Quorum Technologies, UK). The prepared sample was visualised by SEM (JSM-6390LV SEM, JEOL, Japan) and images captured.
