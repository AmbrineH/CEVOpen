<p id="Par21" class="p">The conventional chemical preparation of sediment samples for the visual identification of subfossil material involves hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (HF), acetic acid (CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>COOH), sulphuric acid (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heating the sample to 95 °C. It was considered likely that the exposure of samples to this chemical preparation would have a detrimental effect on the quantity and quality of any DNA preserved within them. Therefore the following preparation method was devised which minimised both the chemical treatment and removed the necessity for heating the sample.
