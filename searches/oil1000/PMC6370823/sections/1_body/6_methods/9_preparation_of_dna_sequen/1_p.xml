<p id="Par26" class="p">Purified DNA was fragmented by using a Covaris E220 focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Massachusetts, U.S.A.), which was programmed for a target fragment size of 500 bp; 105 W, 5% duty factor, 200 cycles per burst, 80 s treatment time. Fragmented DNA was purified by bead purification using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, California, U.S.A.). DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NuGen Ovation Ultralow DR kit (0330-32 NuGen, California, U.S.A.).</p>
