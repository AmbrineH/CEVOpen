<p id="Par25" class="p">DNA was purified using the FastDNA for Soil DNA Extraction Kit (MPBio, 116560200) following the manufacturer’s instructions with a final elution volume of 100 µl. All manipulations were performed inside a class II laminar flow cabinet. Purified DNA was quantified using the Qubit assay (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Horsham, UK). The quality of the purified DNA was assured using either the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, U.S.A.) with High Sensitivity DNA Chips (Agilent, U.S.A.), following the manufacturer’s instructions or the D1000 Tapestation (Aglient, U.S.A.) with High Sensitivity ScreenTape (Agilent, U.S.A.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified DNA was stored at −20 °C until further analysis was performed.</p>
