<p id="Par23" class="p">Prepared samples were analysed by fluorescence using a BD FACS Aria II (Becton Dickenson, USA) equipped with a 100 µm nozzle. Particle forward scatter and side scatter were obtained using a 488 nm laser and the appropriate detectors. Particle fluorescence was excited at 405 nm and at 488 nm, and fluorescence intensity recorded at 530 ± 30 nm and at 585 ± 42 nm respectively. Samples were sorted into autoclaved glass 5 ml vials, which were capped and stored at 4 °C.</p>
