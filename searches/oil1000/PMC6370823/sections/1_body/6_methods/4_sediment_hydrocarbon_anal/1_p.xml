<p id="Par20" class="p">Hydrocarbons were extracted from freeze-dried sediment horizons using a Dionex ASE-200 (California, U.S.A.). A known mass of sediment was placed into an Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE) cartridge and processed using 10 ml of dichloromethane at 1500 psi and 150 °C. Solvent extracts were dried under argon to a volume between 1 and 2 ml. All dried extracts were corrected to volume of 2 ml using dichloromethane in a volumetric flask. Prepared samples were analysed using gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionisation detector (Agilent 7890 GC FID, California, U.S.A.). 1 µl of sample was splitless injected. Samples were also analysed of known standards and each of the modern
