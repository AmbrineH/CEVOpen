 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> therefore confirms that stratigraphy and enables confident paleoenvironmental analysis. Unfortunately, the DNA sequence data acquired in this study cannot be used to perform significant comparisons between the extant 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> genome and that of the microfossils which exceed simple identification of the species. However, as more data become available, understanding the molecular evolution of 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic>, and the divergence of the four extant 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> races from a putative ancestor becomes a real possibility. Moreover, the combination of high throughput, purification of targeted microfossils and DNA sequencing developed here can be applied to other microalgal species and subfossils, such as pollen and spores, and enables unprecedented sensitivity for resolving and understanding the species and environments during periods of abrupt and extreme change which prevailed through the Quaternary
