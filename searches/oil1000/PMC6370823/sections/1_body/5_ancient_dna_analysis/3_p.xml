<p id="Par13" class="p">In addition to the alignments to the nuclear genome, the DNA sequence reads were compared to the organelle chloroplast (NC_025545.1) and mitochondria (NC_027722.1) genomes of 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> as they are available in the NCBI reference database. The increased copy number per cell of these organelle genomes may result in a greater proportion of positive alignments. There were 18 reads from BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> that aligned to the mitochondrion genome and 5 reads which aligned to the chloroplast genome. There were no reads which aligned to either organelle for samples BL
 <sub class="sub">35</sub> and BL
