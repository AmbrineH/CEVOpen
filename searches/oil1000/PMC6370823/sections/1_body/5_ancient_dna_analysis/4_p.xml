<p id="Par14" class="p">The combination of morphological, chemical, genomic and phylogenetic analysis provides compelling evidence that the microfossils identified in Boswell Lake sediment are indeed 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic>. However, more aDNA is required to confirm the phylogenetic assessment of the 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> microfossils at Boswell Lake, necessitating fresh sediment samples and a higher number of 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> microfossils to be purified.
