<p id="Par11" class="p">While the morphology of the putative subfossil 
 <italic class="italic">Botryococcus</italic> is comparable to that of extant 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic>, in the absence of a reliable geolipid profile, molecular verification is necessary to confirm the genus unequivocally. This is the first time a subfossil microalga has been characterised using aDNA at genomic level. DNA was purified from each of the FACS sorted and control samples, DNA sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). DNA sequence reads were quality assured before alignment to the genome of 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic>

 </sup> using PALEOMIX
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>, ensuring complete matches between the DNA sequence reads and the reference genome (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> 4,970 reads aligned to the 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> Showa reference genome, 99 reads from BL
 <sub class="sub">35</sub> aligned and 19 reads aligned from sample BL
 <sub class="sub">125</sub>. For the controls, 4 reads aligned to the 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> reference from the 10,000 bead control and no reads aligned from the 100,000 FACS sorted bead controls, while 5 reads aligned from the pollen control sample (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
