<p id="Par15" class="p">Here we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to obtain 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> microfossils for aDNA analysis from sediments dating back to at least 8,400 cal yrs BP. Conventional techniques were unable to obtain a single type of microfossil from lacustrine sediments in sufficient quantity and purity for aDNA sequencing. However, using a combination of two high throughput and sensitive techniques we extracted sufficient microfossils from the sediment to purify enough high-quality aDNA for next-generation sequencing analysis. This technological combination provides evidence that the morphologically identified 
 <italic class="italic">Botryococous</italic> are correctly classified as 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic>, even in the absence of congruent geolipid signatures. Samples of this age are subject to DNA degradation which may explain the decreasing number of DNA sequence reads that align to the modern reference genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). An alternative interpretation is differences between the DNA sequence reads and the only available reference genome,
