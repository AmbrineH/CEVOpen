<p id="Par9" class="p">Flow cytometry was used to sort 10,000 putative 
 <italic class="italic">Botrycoccus</italic> colonies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) from three horizons at, 0 cm (BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>), 35 cm (BL
 <sub class="sub">35</sub>) and 125 cm (BL
 <sub class="sub">125</sub>) from the surface. Morphology of the sorted microfossils were verified by light (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A,B</xref>) and scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3C,D</xref>) and compared to those of the modern culture of 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> culture and published images of fossil

 </sup>. The sorted samples from Boswell Lake were morphologically similar to the images of extinct 
 <italic class="italic">Botroycoccus</italic> and extant 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic>. However, the characteristic geolipid signature and observed microfossils were not present in the same strata as they are in more ancient sediments, therefore calling into question the precise nature of these microfossils. In addition to the microfossils sorted BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, BL
 <sub class="sub">35</sub> and BL
 <sub class="sub">125</sub> sediment samples, control samples comprising 10,000 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> pollen grains from the same horizon as BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, 10,000 and 100,000 10 µm calibration beads, were sorted using flow cytometry, to identify any nucleic acid contamination from the sorting procedure.
