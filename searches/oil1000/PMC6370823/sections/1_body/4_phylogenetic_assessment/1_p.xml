<p id="Par10" class="p">To determine the relationship between the 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> identified in the recently incorporated (BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) Boswell Lake sediment, extant 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> and a proven set of selected algal species
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>, a phylogenetic classification was performed using the 18S rRNA gene coding sequence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The phylogenetic comparison assigned the sequences from the BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> horizon to the same branch as that of extant 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> and supports the likelihood that the 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> identified in the Boswell Lake sediment is indeed 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic>, and not another colonial microalga. Although DNA was purified and sequenced from BL
 <sub class="sub">35</sub> and BL
 <sub class="sub">125</sub>, 18S rRNA gene sequences could not be identified in the DNA sequence reads from these horizons, potentially due to the sediments’ age and DNA degradation. Consequently, we analysed further the aDNA sequence reads from purified microfossils from BL
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, BL
 <sub class="sub">35</sub> and BL
 <sub class="sub">125</sub> respective to the draft 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> genome.
