<p id="Par4" class="p">Here we investigate the potential for purifying 
 <italic class="italic">Botyrococcus</italic> microfossils and aDNAÂ from sediments known to contain the microalga. Conventional palaeoenvironmental analysis was used to determine the composition of the sediment in combination with palynological techniques to identify and quantify the putative 
 <italic class="italic">B. braunii</italic> microfossils throughout a sediment core extracted from Boswell Lake, British Columbia, Canada. We first performed a two-dimensional gas chromatography analysis of the hydrocarbons present in the sediment to verify that the 
 <italic class="italic">Botryococcus</italic> microfossils identified using these conventional techniques are co-localised with their associated source signature geolipids, as seen in oil shales. However, no such co-localisation was observed due to the migration and degradation of the diagnostic 
 <italic class="italic">Botryococcus</italic> derived geolipids
