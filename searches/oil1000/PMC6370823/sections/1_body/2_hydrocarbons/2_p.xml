 </sup>. This confirms that while geolipids may be used to identify the presence of specific organisms or taxonomic groupings within Holocene sediments generally, potential upwards migration and microbial degradation of hydrocarbons suggests that these biomarkers cannot be used to emphatically prove that the visually identified algal subfossils at a specific horizon are indeed
