 <p> Flow Cytometry Dot Plots and Images. Top - Botryococcus braunii concentration, visually identified in Boswell Lake sediment. i – Forward scatter vs. side scatter height, an indicator of the scatter of Boswell Lake sediment particles. ii – Forward scatter vs. 488 nm excitation, 585/42 nm emission height measurement, particles that are fluorescing intensely gated as P1. iii - Forward scatter vs. 405 nm excitation, 450/40 nm emission height measurement, particles from P1 displayed, those which exhibit high fluorescence are gated P2. The P2 is used to sort B. braunii from Boswell Lake sediment. ( A) Bright field image of prepared Boswell Lake sediment before analysis by flow cytometry. ( B) Bright field image of sorted P2 region from Boswell Lake sediment. ( C) SEM image of extant B. braunii colony, covered in hydrocarbon sheath. Associated bacteria can also be seen. ( D) SEM image of assumed B. braunii sorted from Boswell Lake sediment using flow cytometry. For ( A, B) the scale bar represents 100 µm, for ( C, D) the scale bar represents 10 µm. </p>
