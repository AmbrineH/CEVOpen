 <p> Phylogenetic Assessment of DNA Extracted from FACS-Purified, Subfossil Botryococcus braunii. Phylogenetic tree of the 18S rRNA gene coding sequences from Boswell Lake B. braunii and algal taxa generated using PhyML. The bootstrap percentage values are displayed in red for branches that have credibility values above 50%. The number of DNA sequence reads from samples BL 0, BL 35 and BL 125 which align to these taxa using PALEOMIX and Kraken2 is displayed. </p>
