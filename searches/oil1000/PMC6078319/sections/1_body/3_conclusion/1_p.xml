<p class="p">The volatile compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> from different geographic locations differed in chemotypes, while for other classes, such as phenolics, composition was highly preserved. Such findings could be related to the crucial physiological functions of phenolic compounds, which help the species to survive. The differentiation of volatiles may be associated with some genetic gap and local environmental influences.
