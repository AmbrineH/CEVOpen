<p class="p">Studies on the chemical variability of Lauraceae species have indicated the occurrence of chemotypes in this family. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum osmophloeum</italic> Kaneh has five characterized chemotypes and shows larvicidal activities for only two chemotypes (cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde/cinnamyl acetate) [

 <italic class="italic">Licaria salicijdia</italic> (Sw.) Kosterm, another Lauraceae species, presented high essential oil diversity, and the soil significantly influenced the production of the different chemotypes observed [
