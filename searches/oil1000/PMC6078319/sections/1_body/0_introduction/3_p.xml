<p class="p">Furthermore, despite the importance of alterations observed in chemotypes, currently, ecological effects are poorly understood. Wallis et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] emphasize that the presence of chemotypes (found in 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus globulus</italic>) suggest an evolutionary advantage for the species, increasing the variability of populations, which improves vegetative defense against herbivory. Moreover, Karban et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] showed plants that produce the same volatile chemotype have more effective communication than plants with different composition, and such plants can coordinate their physiological processes to decrease herbivore attack.
