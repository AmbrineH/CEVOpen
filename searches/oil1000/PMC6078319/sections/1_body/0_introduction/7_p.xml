 <italic class="italic">mandioccana</italic>, which showed chemotypes for styrylpyrone derivatives, combined with a conserved profile of flavonoid glycosides. Few studies have focused on chemotype differences at the level of plant metabolism for different compound classes, with no prior research about other Lauraceae species. Herein, we investigated if

 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> chemotypes presented the same volatile and phenolic compounds.
