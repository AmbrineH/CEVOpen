<p class="p">We analyzed the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> and compared samples with α-bisabolol and epi-α-bisabolol by non-chiral column and compared (-)-α-bisabolol by chiral column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201996.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The sesquiterpenes α-bisabolol and epi-α-bisabolol are diastereomers, thus, they showed different physio-chemical properties and different retention times in non-chiral columns. When comparing the α-bisabolol present in 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> to α-bisabolol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201996.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> - compounds 1 and 2), we observed an overlap of the peaks in a non-chiral column (ZB-5MS). In the second analysis in the non-chiral column, α-bisabolol and epi-α-bisabolol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201996.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> - compounds 2 and 3) revealed different retention times of peaks from alpha and epi isomers, and demonstrated that the chromatographic method was efficient to separate these diastereomers. However, the bisabolol present in 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic> is α-bisabolol.
