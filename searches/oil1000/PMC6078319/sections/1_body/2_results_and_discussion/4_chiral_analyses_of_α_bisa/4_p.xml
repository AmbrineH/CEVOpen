<p class="p">The methods used for stereochemical identification are based on previously described analyses, such as Son et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and Attia, Kim and Ro [
 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. These studies reported identification of (-)-α-bisabolol and (+)-epi-α-bisabolol by the chromatographic analyses in non-chiral column (such as DB1-MS column), and subsequent chiral column analysis (α-cyclodextrin chiral) by comparing standards of molecules with known stereochemistry.
