<p class="p">Similarly, the samples were also analyzed by a chiral column. We detected an evident change in retention time comparing the α-bisabolol from 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> and (-)-α-bisabolol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201996.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> - compounds 1 and 4) from 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">erythropappus</italic>, the plant that is currently used to obtain the isoform (-)-α-bisabolol. Therefore, we conclude that α-bisabolol present in 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> is the compound (+)-α-bisabolol, since it presented a different retention time from (-)-α-bisabolol in a chiral column.
