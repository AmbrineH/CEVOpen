<p class="p">To evaluate the difference between chemical composition on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces, the SPME (solid phase microextraction)/GC-MS was carried out using the samples S6 and S7. The adaxial and abaxial surfaces were scraped and added into vials for extraction. The compounds identified are described in
