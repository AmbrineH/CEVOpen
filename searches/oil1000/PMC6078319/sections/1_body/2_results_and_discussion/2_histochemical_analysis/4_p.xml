<p class="p">The leaves presented an unstratified epidermis and idioblasts distributed on both sides of the leaf between palisade parenchyma and in the spongy parenchyma (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201996.s005" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). The samples S6 (chemotype A) and C1 and C3 (chemotype B) presented different amounts of idioblasts. Likewise, all the samples presented a higher number of idioblasts on the adaxial surface than the abaxial surface (p &lt; 0.001). The difference in the number of idioblasts on each side was calculated by the average amount of idioblasts in the same leaf region. This data is shown in
