 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], as well as determine economically important species due to high prevalences and incidence of compounds, such as sesquiterpene α-bisabolol (approximately 93.7%), in specific regions. This sesquiterpene was only observed in the specimens from the São Paulo region, and is used for biotechnological purposes, as the essential oil from
