<p class="p">The mass signals of raw data files from GC-MS analyses were extracted and aligned by metAlign software [
 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], producing 3222 entrances. Subsequently, the data was reduced by MSClust software [
 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], resulting in 79 reconstructed metabolites. Finally, the processed data was statistically analysed by Metaboanalyst 4.0 platform [
 <xref rid="pone.0201996.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] using OrthoPLSDA. For OrthoPLSDA, the data was normalized by median and log average transformations.
