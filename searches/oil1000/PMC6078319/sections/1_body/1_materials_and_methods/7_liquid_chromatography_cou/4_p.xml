<p class="p">The column temperature was 50°C, the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min using 2 μL for the injection volume. The mass spectrometry analyses were obtained in positive and negative ion mode (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 120–1200), and the compounds were monitored at wavelengths from 240 to 800 nm. The compounds were identified by UV spectral data, accurate mass, and fragmentation profile compared to data from the literature.
