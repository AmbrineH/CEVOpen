 <italic class="italic">megapotamica</italic> leaves at similar development stages, which were located 3 cm above the petiole with the surface size of 2x2 cm. The measurements were performed using 20 microscopic fields at a magnification of 200 diameters, and the numbers are presented as mean and standard error of the means. A t-test was used for statistical analyses.
