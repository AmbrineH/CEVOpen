<p class="p">The fresh and healthy adult leaves from S6 and S7 were prepared as described above. Afterwards, the adaxial and abaxial foliar surfaces were scraped to obtain the outermost cells. The material was placed in a 2 mL vial to extract volatile compounds by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and analyses by GC-MS. The polydimethylsiloxane fiber (Supelco, Bellafonte, PA, USA) (thickness 100 μm) attached to SPME Holder (57330-U) was exposed to the sample for 50 minutes at 40°C for extraction in the vials. The desorption of volatile compounds was carried out through fiber exposure directly in the gas chromatograph injection chamber at 250°C for 4 minutes.</p>
