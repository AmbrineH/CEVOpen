 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 45–300. The injection temperature was 250°C in split mode (9:1) using the enantioselective column Alpha DEXtm 120 (Supelco; Bellefonte, PA) with 30m x 0.25mm x 0.25μm and ZB-5MS column (Phenomenex; USA). The initial temperature was 50°C for 1 min, followed by heater of 2°C/min up to 170°C.
