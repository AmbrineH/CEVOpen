<p class="p">The essential oils of S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 were analyzed at the natural and synthetic products research center (NPPNS) at the University of São Paulo (USP) using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph, model QP-2010, column EN-5MS (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm) at concentration of 1 mg/mL. The split mode ratio was 1:5, and injector and interface temperature was 240°C. The carrier gas used was helium, and the temperature program was an isothermal mode with an initial temperature of 60°C using a heater of 3°C/min up to 240°C.</p>
