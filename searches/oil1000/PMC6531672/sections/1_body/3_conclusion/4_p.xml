<p id="p0095" class="p">The species reviewed in this study are often directly available to local communities, however they are often neglected in poverty and nutritional strategies. For instance 
 <italic class="italic">Vitellaria paradoxa</italic> is well known for shea butter production, but several species with higher fat content, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Irvingia gabonensis, Sclerocarya birrea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Balanites aegyptiaca</italic>, are rarely use, and could have high potentials for improving food and nutritional security. Only few of the species are widely known and exported, but these few species have large economic potentials, eg 
 <italic class="italic">Vitallaria paradoxa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Elaeis guineensis</italic>. Many other species have similar properties, which indicates a large unexploited potential from native species in West Africa.
