 <p class="p">Recently, seaweeds and their extracts have attracted great interest in the pharmaceutical industry as a source of bioactive compounds. Studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic activity of macroalgae towards different types of cancer cell models, and their consumption has been suggested as a chemo-preventive agent against several cancers such as breast, cervix and colon cancers. Reports relevant to the chemical properties of brown algae 
  <italic class="italic">Padina</italic> sp. are limited and those accompanied to a comprehensive evaluation of the biological activity on osteosarcoma (OS) are non existent. In this report, we explored the chemical composition of French Polynesian 
  <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic> extract (EPP) by spectrophotometric assays (total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin content, and antioxidant activity) and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, and provided EPP lipid and sterols profiles. Several compounds with relevant biological activity were also identified that suggest interesting pharmacological and health-protecting effects for EPP. Moreover, we demonstrated that EPP presents good anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities against two OS cell lines, SaOS-2 and MNNG, with different cancer-related phenotypes. Finally, our data suggest that EPP might target different properties associated with cancer development and aggressiveness.
