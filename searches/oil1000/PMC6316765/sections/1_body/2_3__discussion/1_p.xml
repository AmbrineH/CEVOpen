<p class="p">Recently, natural bioactive compounds derived from marine organisms, especially those obtained from seaweeds, have received greater attention. Their high level of biodiversity makes them a considerable reservoir for active compounds as they are able to produce a great variety of secondary metabolites characterized by a wide range of biological activities. Many previous studies demonstrated the remarkable benefits of seaweeds on human health and protection against chronic disease [
