<p class="p">According to our results, EPP presents good anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities against two osteosarcoma cell lines, namely MNNG and SaOS-2. These two cell lines were chosen based on their intrinsic properties, as they have opposite cancer-related phenotypes. According to Lauvrak [
 <xref rid="B56-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], MNNG cells have been defined as very aggressive in terms of tumorigenicity, colony forming ability, migration/invasion and proliferation capacity; on the contrary, SaOS-2 cells have been classified as poorly aggressive. Moreover, these two cell lines possess a different p53 mutation status, being MNNG p53 mutant and SaOS-2 p53-null [

 <xref rid="B58-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] and thus induce p53-dependent apoptosis in human OS cells by the activation of extrinsic pathways. Finally, we evaluated EPP toxicity in human primary osteoblasts and found that these cells were significantly less affected by the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of EPP (data not shown)
