<p class="p">In literature there are several works that confirm the antitumoral activities for 
 <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic>. The dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic> was found to be cytotoxic towards the KB tumor cell line. An oxysterol, (hydroperoxy-24 vinyl-24 cholesterol), was identified as being responsible for this activity [

 <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic> methanol extract against human cervix (HeLa) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-453) cell lines have been reported [
 <xref rid="B60-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The observed anticancer activity could be connected to the rich content of phenolics, in particular the antiproliferative effects of polyphenols were reported to be due to the regulation of apoptosis, decreased Bcl-2 levels and increased Bax, Caspase-8 and Caspase-10 levels, and Fas death receptor signalling [
 <xref rid="B61-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Moreover, glycosides, sulfated polysaccharides and carotenoids of the brown seaweed were found to act as potential chemoterapeutic or chemopreventive agents through the induction of caspases or cell cycle arrest [

 <xref rid="B65-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. In agreement with the works above mentioned and considering the present characterization of EPP (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-16-00504-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-16-00504-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-16-00504-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), we might assume that the main constituents responsible for the antitumoral effect—that we observed in our work—may be identified in fucosterol, in two terpenoid compounds, such as dihydroactinidiolide and phytol, of which EPP was found to be rich, and in oleic acid. Notwithstanding, it should be also considered that macroalgae extracts are complex matrices and that biological activities of such extracts might not be closely related to a specific compound but rather to the mixture of components that can act synergistically. Therefore, any biological activity can be hardly explained with the analysis of a specific algae component.
