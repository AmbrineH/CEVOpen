<p class="p">As far as the FAs composition, palmitic acid appears to be the predominant FA in our extract, as in Dictyotales order brown algae [

 <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic>, a significant percentage of oleic and palmitoleic acid was also detected. Oleic acid attracted attention as the Mediterranean diet, characterized by high olive oil (rich in oleic acid) consumption, has been linked to a protective effect against cancer [
