<p class="p">Previous studies reported the antioxidant activity of some brown algae measured with the FRAP method. Agregán et al. measured the in vitro antioxidant activity of aqueous extracts of three brown seaweed from the Atlantic Ocean, in the area of Camariñas, Spain. They found FRAP values of 7.52, 51.66 and 26.93 µmol/g of extract for

 <italic class="italic">Bifurcaria bifurcata,</italic> respectively [

Kelman et al. quantified the antioxidant activity of methanol extracts from 37 samples of algae, comprising 30 species of Hawaiian algae from 27 different genera. They showed that the brown algae as a group had the highest mean antioxidant activity among Hawaiian algae with a mean FRAP value of 3.55 ± 3.16 μM/μg extract [

 <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic> appeared in line with the previous works on brown algae, given that acetone is not the chosen solvent for the extraction of antioxidant compounds.
