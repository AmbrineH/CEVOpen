<p class="p">Several terpenes and terpenoid compounds were identified in 
 <italic class="italic">P. pavonica</italic>. Terpenoids are considered as promising bioactive molecules in the search for anticancer drugs, due to their effect in inhibiting mitotic cell division [
 <xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Various diterpenes have been identified in several species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Cystoseira</italic> with antitumoral and antioxidant activities [

 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], it can suppress the growth of tumor cells, partially prevent the development of chemically-induced cancer and cause regression of some already existing tumors [
 <xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. A rich squalene diet enhances chemoterapeutic activity by increasing immune system efficiency and by lowering blood cholesterol content [

 <xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Squalene supplementation stimulates the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in a marked increase in cellular and non-specific immune function [
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Evidence suggests that squalene might assist in maintaining white cell counts during radiation treatment [
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], and, in animal models, supplementation is associated with prolonged survival time subsequent to exposure to lethal doses of radiation [
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Squalene’s ability to inhibit ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is also of significant interest in cancer prevention and treatment [
 <xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Cancer cells are known to utilize polyamines as growth substrates, and since ODC is a rate-limiting enzyme in the generation of many of the polyamines, ongoing cancer research has been, and is currently, investigating agents with the ability to interfere with this enzyme’s activity [
