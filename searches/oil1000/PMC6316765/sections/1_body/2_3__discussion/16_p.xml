<p class="p">The differences in EPP chemical profiles observed between present and literature data can be explained on the basis of environmental and experimental conditions. Several parameters are known to influence the composition of phenolic compounds or FAs produced by the same species of algae: stage of algal growth, harvest season, geographic location, genetic diversity etc. [
