<p class="p">Apoptosis was detected in SaOS-2 and MNNG cells treated with EPP for 6 h, by FITC Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Molecular Probes; Invitrogen Corp., Eugene, OR, USA) following manufactures protocol. A total of 300 cells from each sample were scored by using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss AXIO LAB AI, Oberkochen, Germany) and were assessed as viable cells (AnV−/PI−), early apoptotic cells (AnV+/PI−), late apoptosis (AnV+/PI+) and necrotic cells (AnV−/PI+).</p>
