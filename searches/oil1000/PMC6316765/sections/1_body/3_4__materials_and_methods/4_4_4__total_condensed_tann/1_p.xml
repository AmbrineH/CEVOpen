<p class="p">The determination of the content of condensed tannins was performed according to the Broadhurst vanillin-HCl method [
 <xref rid="B68-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. A stock standard solution of 1 mg/mL of catechin was prepared in methanol, and then working standard solutions were prepared in the range of 0.05–0.30 mg/mL. 500 µL of standard/sample (2 mg/mL in DMSO) were mixed to 3 mL of 4% vanillin solution in methanol and 1.5 mL of concentrated HCl. Each solution was prepared in triplicate. The samples and the standard were incubated for 15 min in the dark. The absorbance was red at 765 nm using a Tecan Spark 20M multimode microplate reader. The results were expressed as mg of catechin per gram of extract.
