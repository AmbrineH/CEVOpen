<p class="p">SaOS-2 and MNNG cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> or 3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/well, respectively, and cultured until sub-confluence (70–75% confluence). Cells were serum starved (FBS 0.1%) for 24 h and then treated with different concentrations of EPP (3.1, 6.25; 12.5, 25, 50 100 and 200 µg/mL) in starvation medium. Controls were performed treating cells with DMSO 0.2% 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>, corresponding to the higher concentration of the compound. After 24 h of treatment, cells were washed with sterile PBS and MTT was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. After a 3.5 h incubation, cells were lysed with 100 µL DMSO. The absorbance was measured at 550 nm and percentage of cell viability was calculated relative to control and EPP half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated by GraphPad Prism software. The experiment was repeated three times.
