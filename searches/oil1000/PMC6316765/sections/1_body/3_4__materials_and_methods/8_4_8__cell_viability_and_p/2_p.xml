<p class="p">Cell proliferation was evaluated by cell counting with Scepter™ 2.0 Cell Counter (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). SaOS-2 and MNNG cells were seeded in 24-well plate at a density of 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> and 3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well, respectively, and cultured until sub-confluence (70–75% confluence). Cells were serum starved (FCS 0.1%) for 24 h and then treated with different concentrations of EPP corresponding to IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>/2, IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and 2*IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> in starvation medium. After 24 h of treatment, cells were washed with sterile PBS and detached by trypsin. Cells were collected in clean tubes and counted, percentage of cell proliferation was calculated relative to control.
