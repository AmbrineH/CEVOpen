<p class="p">The quantitative assay of the total phenolic compounds was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B66-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. A stock standard solution of 0.5 mg/mL gallic acid was prepared in 95% methanol, and then working standard solutions were prepared in the range 0.05–0.45 mg/mL. 100 µL of standard/sample (5 mg/mL in DMSO) were mixed to 200 µL of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent in DI water and 700 µL of 0.7 M Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Each solution was prepared in triplicate. The samples and the standards were incubated for 30 min in the dark. The absorbance was red at 765 nm using a Tecan Spark 20M multimode microplate reader. The total phenolic content was expressed as mg gallic acid per gram of extract.
