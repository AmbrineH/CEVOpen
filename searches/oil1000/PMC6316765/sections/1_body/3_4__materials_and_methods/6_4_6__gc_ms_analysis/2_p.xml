 <xref rid="B70-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] before the derivatization step. Briefly, 30 mg of EPP were dispersed in 2 mL of methanol; 1 mL of 2 M methanolic KOH was added and the mixture was heated in a water bath for 1 h at 80 °C shaking vigorously every 15 min. Then 1.2 mL of 1 M HCl was added and the mixture was vortex-mixed. An aliquot of 400 µL was transferred to a glass centrifuge tube and 1.6 mL of DI water was added. The DLLME was performed injecting rapidly 1 mL of a mixture of acetone (900 µL) and chloroform (100 µL) into the glass tube. The tube was closed and gently shaken by hand for 1 min. After that the tube was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the lower phase was collected with a microsyringe. An aliquot of 50 µL of the collected phase was mixed with 30 µL of pyridine and 30 µL of BSTFA and heated in a water bath for 30 min at 80 °C. An aliquot of 3 µL was injected manually in the GC-MS.
