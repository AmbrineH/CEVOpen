<p class="p">The identification of the compounds in the GC-MS chromatograms was based on a comparison of the electron ionization (EI) spectra with the NIST MS library database and, in addition, the study of the mass spectrum of each peak was carried out to further elucidate the identification of the compounds with a higher probability. Standards of fucosterol and cholesterol were also analysed to obtain the exact retention time for the identification. Considering the instrumental technique used, the discrimination between isomers was not possible in certain cases.</p>
