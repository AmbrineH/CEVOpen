<p class="p">Analysis was performed with an Agilent 6890 Series gas chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with an Agilent 5973 quadrupole mass analyser (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with the MSD ChemStation software (software version D.03.00). A Phenomenex ZB-5MS plus (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column (Torrance, CA, USA) was used. The oven temperature was programmed as follow: the initial column temperature of 90 °C (1 min) was increased to 110 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min; then it was increased to 233 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held for 5 min; then it was increased to 300 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and held for 5 min and then it was increased to 325 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held for 10 min. The total run time was 40.65 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.4 mL/min. The split ratio was 50:1 and the injector temperature was 285 °C. For electron ionization (EI) we used the ionization voltage 70 eV. The temperatures used were 150 °C for the MS Quad and 230°C for the MS Source. Full scan mass spectra were acquired at the mass range of 35–550 Da.</p>
