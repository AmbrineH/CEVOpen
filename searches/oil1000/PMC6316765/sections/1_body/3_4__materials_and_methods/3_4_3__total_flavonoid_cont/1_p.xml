 <xref rid="B67-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. A stock standard solution of 1 mg/mL of quercetin was prepared in methanol, and then working standard solutions were prepared in the range of 0.05–0.30 mg/mL. 500 µL of standard/sample (1 mg/mL in DMSO) were mixed to 100 µL of 10% AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in 1 M potassium acetate and 3.3 mL of methanol. Each solution was prepared in triplicate. After 30 min of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 430 nm using a Tecan Spark 20M multimode microplate reader. The results were expressed as mg of quercetin per gram of extract.
