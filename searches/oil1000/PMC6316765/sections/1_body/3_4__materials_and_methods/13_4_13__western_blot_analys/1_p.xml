<p class="p">After treatment with EPP, cells were washed with sterile PBS, lysed with RIPA buffer, added with phosphate and protease inhibitors, and then disrupted by sonication for 5 min in an ice bath. Protein concentration was assessed by BCA protein assay. 20 µg of protein were resolved by 12% SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% 
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic> nonfat dry milk at 4 °C with gentle shaking, ON. The membrane was incubated with anti-caspase 3 (rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:1000 Cell Signaling) and anti-GAPDH HRP-conjugated (1:50,000) primary antibodies, in the same buffer, ON at 4 °C. The blot was washed three times with PBS and incubated with anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) 1:80,000 for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times with PBS and immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL (Luminata Crescendo, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and images acquired by LAS4000 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The optical densities of immunoreactive bands were analysed by ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA, V 7.0) using GAPDH as a loading normalizing factor. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
