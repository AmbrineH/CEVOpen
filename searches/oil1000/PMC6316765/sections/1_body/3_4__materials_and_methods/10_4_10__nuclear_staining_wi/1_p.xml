<p class="p">SaOS-2 and MNNG cells were seeded in 8-well chambered slide at a density of 8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> and 6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cells/well respectively. After treatment with EPP for 24 h, the slides were washed with PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min. Finally, the slides were washed twice with PBS and mounted with fluoroshield mounting medium containing DAPI. Images were captured by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss AxioLabA1, Oberkochen, Germany).
