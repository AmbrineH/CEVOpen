<p class="p">The determination of the antioxidant activity of the extract was performed on the method of FRAP assay [
 <xref rid="B69-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], based on the redox reaction of the reduced oxidant Fe(III) complexed by TPTZ (2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine). The FRAP reagent for the calibration curve was prepared mixing 0.3 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 0.01 M TPTZ and DI water in proportion 10:1:1, respectively. A 0.001 M FeSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>·7H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O solution in DI water was used as standard for the calibration levels. The sample was analyzed mixing 100 µL of the extract solution at 5 mg/mL in DMSO with 900 µL of DI water and 2 mL of FRAP reagent, obtained mixing 0.3 M acetate buffer, 0.01 M TPTZ and a 0.02 M FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>·6H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O solution in proportion 10:1:1, respectively. All the reagents were prepared fresh. Each solution was prepared in triplicate. All the solutions were incubated for 30 min in the dark. Then the absorbance was measured at 593 nm using a Tecan Spark 20M multimode microplate reader. The scavenging ability was expressed as µmol of Fe
