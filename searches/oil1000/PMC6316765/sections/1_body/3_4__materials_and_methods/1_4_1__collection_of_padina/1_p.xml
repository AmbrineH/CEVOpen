<p class="p">The algae (
 <italic class="italic">Padina pavonica</italic> (Linnaeus) Thivy) were collected from the coastal area of Moorea, French Polynesia, in June 2014. Fronds of mature plants (20 mm) were harvested and then rinsed with water to remove salt and the associated debris. The cleaned material was air-dried and stored in a dehumidified chamber to remove the residual moisture. Once completely dried, the algae material was ground into a fine powder and extracted with acetone in a Soxhlet extractor. After that, the mixture was filtered through filter paper and the filtrate was collected. The solution was dried by rotary evaporator and the resulting material was kept in the refrigerator until the analyses.
