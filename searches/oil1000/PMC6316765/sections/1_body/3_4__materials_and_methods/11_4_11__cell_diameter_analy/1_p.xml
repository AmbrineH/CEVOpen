 <xref rid="B74-marinedrugs-16-00504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] the Scepter 2.0 cell counter could be used to evaluate apoptosis in an accurate and reproducible way by measuring cell diameter. Cell size distributions were shown as histograms on the monitor of the Scepter™ 2.0 Cell Counter, and these data were analyzed with the Scepter™ 2.0 Software Pro computer software. Before the cell diameter were analyzed, the upper and lower gates of the counter were adjusted manually to eliminate small particles. Data regarding cell diameter are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) values of triplicated experiments.
