<p class="p">A number of studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic activity of macroalgae towards different types of cancer cell models and certain authors have suggested the consumption of algae as a chemo-preventive agent against several cancers. In particular, brown algae have demonstrated to be rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which block growth and systemic spread of human breast cancer, polysaccharides and terpenoids which are considered as promising bioactive molecules with anticancer activity [
