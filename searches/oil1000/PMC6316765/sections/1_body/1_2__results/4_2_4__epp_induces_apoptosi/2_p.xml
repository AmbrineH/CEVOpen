<p class="p">To confirm the pro-apoptotic effect of EPP, we performed the Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) assay on SaOS-2 and MNNG cells treated with EPP (at their relative IC

SaOS-2 apoptotic cells were, roughly, completely absent in the untreated culture, as expected for cancer cells: 88.04 ± 3.33% of non-apoptotic (AnV−/PI−), 11.17 ± 2.94 of early apoptotic (AnV+/PI−) and 0.79 ± 0.47% of late apoptotic (AnV+/PI+). When cells were treated with progressively higher concentrations of EPP, the number of early apoptotic and late apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner (IC

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00504-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A,B) had a quite similar trend, finding a very low percentage of apoptotic cells (6.08 ± 2.84%) in the untreated culture and an increasing percentage of early and late apoptotic cells with progressively higher concentrations of EPP (IC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub>: 5.63 ± 5.63 of AnV+/PI and 93.67 ± 5.32% of AnV+/PI+). On MNNG cells, EPP demonstrated a greater pro-apoptotic effect. In fact, in MNNG cells treated with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>/2, we detected a greater percentage of late apoptotic cells in respect of SaOS-2 challenged with the same EPP concentration (AnV+/PI+: 72.46 ± 9.12% and 31.83 ± 8.20%, respectively).
