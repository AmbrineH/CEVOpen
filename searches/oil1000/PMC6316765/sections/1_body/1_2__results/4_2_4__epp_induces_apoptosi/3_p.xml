<p class="p">To study if caspases activation was involved in EPP-induced apoptosis, we finally evaluated the activation of caspase-3 by western blot analysis. The immunoreactive band of cleaved caspase-3 increased in a dose-dependent manner after 6 h treatment with EPP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00504-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). In SaOS-2 cell lines we detected a 2.6 and 7.1-fold increase in the activation of caspase-3 when treated with EPP at IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and 2*IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> respectively. On the contrary in MNNG cells, we observed a dose-dependent increase in the activation of caspase-3. The immunoreactive band was significantly higher than SaOS-2 already after treatment with the lowest concentration of EPP (2.4-fold at IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>/2) and increased over the other two concentrations (3.2-fold at IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and 3.7-fold at 2*IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>).
