<p class="p">To evaluate whether EPP exhibited cytotoxicity through apoptosis in both OS cell lines, a DAPI staining analysis was performed to observe nuclear morphological changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-16-00504-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>B). Such analysis demonstrated that the exposure of OS cells to EPP induced apoptosis in a dose dependent manner; indeed, both SaOS-2 and MNNG cells showed loss of regular shape and well-defined boundaries. Moreover, at the highest concentration tested (2*IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>), EPP exhibited a more remarkable apoptotic effect against MNNG than SaOS-2 with greater nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation and nuclear blebbing.
