<p class="p">EPPs FAs profile showed the presence of FAs with aliphatic chains ranging from 12 up to 22 carbon atoms (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-16-00504-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Saturated FAs (SFAs) corresponded to 43.45% of total EPP (63.13% of total FAs). Among these, the most abundant FA was palmitic acid with a total percentage of 34.15%, followed by stearic (3.25%), pentadecanoic (1.95%), arachidic (0.74%), myristic (0.43%), lauric (0.47%) and behenic (0.04%). Monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) were 23.67% of total EPP (34.40% of total FAs). The most abundant MUFA was palmitelaidic acid (16:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-7 E, 7.82%) followed by oleic acid (18:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-9, 7.79%) and palmitoleic acid (16:1 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-7 Z, 6.29%). Polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) corresponded to 1.70% of EPP (2.47% of total FAs). The main PUFAs found in EPP was arachidonic acid (20:4 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6, 0.64%) followed by linoleic (18:2 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6, 0.53) and eicosapentanoic acid (20:5 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 0.24%). We also calculated the ratio between 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-6 and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-3 PUFAs which corresponded to 5.61.
