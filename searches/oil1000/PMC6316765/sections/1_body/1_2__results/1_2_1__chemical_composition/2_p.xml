<p class="p">EPP was first chemically characterized for its total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin content through spectrophotometric assays. The total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents of the seaweed were 27.0, 54.8, and 54.3 mg per g of extract, respectively, corresponding to 0.81, 1.64 and 1.63 mg per g of dry material, respectively. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and resulted as 25.6 ± 0.2 µmol of Fe
