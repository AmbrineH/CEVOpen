 <p> ( A) Apoptosis assessment using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and fluorescent microscopy of SaOS-2 and MNNG OS cells line treated with EPP/Acetone (IC 50/2, IC 50, 2*IC 50) for 6 h. Viable cells did not show any kind of coloration (Anv−/PI−). Cells stained in green (AnV+/PI−) were considered as early apoptotic cells, while cells stained both in green and red (Anv+/PI−) were considered as late apoptotic cells. Cells are shown at ×40 magnification. Arrows indicate co-localization. ( B) Histograms show the percentage of non-apoptotic(AnV−/PI−), early apoptotic (AnV+/PI−) and late apoptotic (AnV+/PI+) cells in respect to control. The quantitative assessment of apoptosis was obtained observing merged images. Results were obtained from three different experiments in triplicate, **** p &lt; 0.0001. </p>
