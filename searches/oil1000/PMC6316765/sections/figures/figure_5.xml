   <sub class="sub">50</sub>) for 6 h. Viable cells did not show any kind of coloration (Anv−/PI−). Cells stained in green (AnV+/PI−) were considered as early apoptotic cells, while cells stained both in green and red (Anv+/PI−) were considered as late apoptotic cells. Cells are shown at ×40 magnification. Arrows indicate co-localization. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Histograms show the percentage of non-apoptotic(AnV−/PI−), early apoptotic (AnV+/PI−) and late apoptotic (AnV+/PI+) cells in respect to control. The quantitative assessment of apoptosis was obtained observing merged images. Results were obtained from three different experiments in triplicate, ****
