 <p> ( A) Bright-field images of SaOS-2 and MNNG OS cells line after 24 h treatment with EPP at IC 50/2, IC 50 and 2*IC 50 or DMSO 0.3% as negative control. Cells are shown at ×10 magnification. ( B) Nuclear morphological changes and DNA damage assessment in SaOS-2 and MNNG cells OS cells line after 24 h treatment with EPP at IC 50/2, IC 50 and 2*IC 50 using DMSO 0.3% as negative control. Arrows indicate nuclear fragmentation, which can be considered a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. Cells are shown at ×63 magnification. </p>
