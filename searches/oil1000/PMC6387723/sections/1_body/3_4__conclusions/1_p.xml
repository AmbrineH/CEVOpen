<p class="p">In this study, the chemical compositions of the essential oils from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. dentata</italic> were determined. 
 <italic class="italic">Î²</italic>-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor were identified as the main components of the two essential oils. In this study, the validated analytical method allowed the simultaneous quantification of two main components of each nanoencapsulated essential oil, allowing the direct monitoring of these components in biological tests 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>. Hence, it is of great importance, due to the lack of analytical methods by direct GC-FID, to analyze these nanoencapsulated essential oils reported in the literature.
