 <p> Genes mRNA expression levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in MDA-MB-231 cells (A) and SUM 149 cells (B). The cells were treated for 24 h with C. juttae essential oil (EO) (46 and 64 μg/ml, respectively). Data are expressed as mean ± standard error (SE) of two different experiments. Different letters (a, b, c and d) in the column of the cell lines and treatments represent significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) among the treatments of each cell line; *differences when treatments are compared to the control (p &lt; 0.05). </p>
