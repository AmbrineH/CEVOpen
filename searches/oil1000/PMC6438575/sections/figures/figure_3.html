 <p> NF‑κB (p65 subunit) DNA binding capacity in nuclear extracts of MDA-MB-231 cells (A) and of SUM 149 cells (B). The cells were treated for 24 h with C. juttae essential oil (EO) (46 and 64 μg/ml, respectively). Results (mean ± standard error of two experiments carried out in duplicate) are expressed as arbitrary units/μg protein of cells nuclear extracts. Statistical differences are *p &lt; 0.05 vs. control. </p>
