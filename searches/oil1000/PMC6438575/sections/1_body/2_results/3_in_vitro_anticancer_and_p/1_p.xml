 <italic class="italic">juttae</italic> essential oil on MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">juttae</italic> reduced cell growth in a dose dependent way, in particular the cell line more sensitive was MDA-MB-231 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214594.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The essential oil did not show cytotoxic activity on the non-tumorigenic cell line 1-7HB2. The cell growth inhibition was: 0% at 30 μg/ml; 10 ± 2% at 50 μg/ml; 17.5 ± 1.5% at 70 μg/ml; and 23 ± 2% at 100 μg/ml.
