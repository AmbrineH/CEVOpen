<p class="p">Essential oil sample was analyzed by GC-MS on a Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra equipped with an AOC-20i autoinjector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and a ZB-5 fused silica column (5% phenyl polysiloxane; 30 m long, inner diam 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm, Phenomenex). One μl of diluted sample (5x10
 <sup class="sup">-3</sup>, in n-pentane) was injected at 280°C in a split ratio of 1:1, and the column flow (carrier gas: helium) was set at 3 mL min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. The GC oven temperature was held for 1 min at 60°C, then increased by 10°C min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> to 300°C and held for 5 min. The MS interface worked at 300°C, and the ion source at 200°C. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV (in EI mode) from m/z 30 to 450. The GC-MS data were processed using the GCMSolution package, Version 4.11 (Shimadzu Corporation 1999–2013).
