<p class="p">Subsequently, the addition of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody provided a sensitive colorimetric readout that may be quantified by densitometry (iMark Microplate Reader; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The specificity of the assay was confirmed by simultaneous incubations in the presence of excess, non-immobilized consensus oligonucleotides, as a competitor, or of a mutated consensus oligonucleotide. The results were expressed as arbitrary units: one unit indicated the DNA binding capacity exerted by 2.5 μg whole cell extract from Jurkat cells (positive control for NF-κB p65 activation; Active Motif) (stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and calcium ionophore) per microgram of protein from the nuclear extracts.</p>
