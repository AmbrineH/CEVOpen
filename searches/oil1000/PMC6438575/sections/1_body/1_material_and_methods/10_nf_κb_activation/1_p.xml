<p class="p">The DNA-binding capacity of NF-κB (p65 subunit) was determined in the nuclear extracts of MDA-MB-231 and SUM 149 cells using the TransAM NF-κB and Nuclear Extract kits (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were treated with 46 μg/ml and 64 μg/ml, respectively, of the essential oil for 24 h. Briefly, the determination of binding capacity was based on a 96-well plate, upon which an oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus binding site (5'-GGGACTTTCC-3') was immobilized. Activated NF-κB contained in the extracts is able to specifically bind to this nucleotide. NF-κB bound to the oligonucleotide may subsequently be detected using an antibody directed against an epitope on p65 (polyclonal rabbit anti-human; cat. no. 40096; 1:1000; Active Motif), accessible only when NF-κB is bound to its target DNA.</p>
