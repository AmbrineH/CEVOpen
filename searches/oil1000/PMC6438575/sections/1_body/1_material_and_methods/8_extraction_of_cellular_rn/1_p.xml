<p class="p">Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). For the evaluation of gene expression, RNA was reverse transcribed using a high capacity complementary DNA (cDNA) reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies). The resulting cDNAs were subjected to real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies) in triplicates. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: Denaturation at 50°C for 2 min, annealing at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and extension at 60°C for 60 min. The running of the samples and data collection were performed on a StepOne AB Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies). β-actin was used as an internal standard. The specific primers used were as follows: Survivin Hs00153353, XIAP Hs00236913, Bcl-2 Hs00236329, ABCB1 Hs00184005 (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies).</p>
