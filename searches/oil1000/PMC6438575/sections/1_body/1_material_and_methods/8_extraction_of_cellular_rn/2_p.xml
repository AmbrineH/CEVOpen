<p class="p">Relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method [ΔCt = Ct
 <sub class="sub">(target gene)</sub>-Ct
 <sub class="sub">(housekeeping gene)</sub>]. Where Ct was the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence of each sample passed the fixed threshold. Fluorescence was measured at 515–518 nm using StepOne AB Real Time PCR System software (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies). The ΔΔCt method was used to determine gene expression levels. ΔΔCt was calculated using the formula: ΔΔCt = ΔCt
 <sub class="sub">(each sample)</sub>-ΔCt
 <sub class="sub">(reference sample)</sub>. Fold change was calculated using the 2
 <sup class="sup">-ΔΔCt</sup> equation.
