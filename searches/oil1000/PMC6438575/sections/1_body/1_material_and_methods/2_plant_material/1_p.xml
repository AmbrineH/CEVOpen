 <italic class="italic">Cyhostemma juttae</italic> were collected in July 2017 from plants cultivated at the Botanical Garden of the University of Palermo. The plants were raised from seeds in 1984 and pot cultivated in the open with references code: Vitaceae N-146. The matrices were placed in paper bags and kept at -30Â°C for 24 hours before hydrodistillation. No specific permits were required for the described location and for the collection of plant material because the plants are part of the living collection of the Botanical Garden of the University of Palermo and the authors have access to that. The plant species used in the present study is not endangered and the IUCN category assessed is Least Concern [
