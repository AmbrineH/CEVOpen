<p class="p">MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI-1640 and the SUM 149 cell line was cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml). 1-7HB2 cell line was cultured in DMEM low glucose supplemented with hydrocortisone (5 μg/ml) and insulin (10 μg/ml). All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all reagents were from EuroClone S.p.A., Milan, Italy; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA). The cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. After obtaining the cells, the first passage carried out was assigned passage number 1. Cells with a narrow range of passage number (4 ± 6) were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination were used for all experiments.
