<p class="p">Whole-cell lysates were obtained from breast cancer cells using RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) and 25 Î¼g protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Filters were incubated with primary antibodies raised against GAPDH (0411) (sc-47724 mouse anti-human polyclonal antibody 1:10000), Bcl-2 (sc-509 mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody 1:200) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA, Inc, XIAP (#2042, rabbit anti-human antibody, 1:500) from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, Survivin (NB500-201, rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody, 1:2000) from Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and results were expressed as arbitrary units (protein/GADPH).</p>
