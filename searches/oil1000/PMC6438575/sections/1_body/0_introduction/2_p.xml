<p class="p">The aim of this paper was to identify the chemical composition of the essential oil of the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Cyphostemma juttae</italic> Dinter &amp; Gilg (Desc.) obtained by hydrodistillation (HD) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and to verify some biological activities on two triple negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SUM 149). Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are highly aggressive, do not respond to conventional hormonal interventions due to the lack of the respective receptor targets, have chances of early recurrence, metastasize, tend to be more invasive in nature, develop drug resistance and they are also characterized by the over-expression of the transcription factor NF-κB [
