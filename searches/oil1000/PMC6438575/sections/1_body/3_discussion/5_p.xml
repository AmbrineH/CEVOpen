<p class="p">Moreover, in the same cancer models, the essential oil showed antitumor capacities in the terms of cytotoxic and pro-oxidant activities and partially pro-apoptotic effects proven by preliminary cytofluorimetric analysis by propidium iodide where only a modest block in preG0-G1 position dose-dependent is observed in all cell lines and also shown in other studies [

It is very interesting to note that the essential oil exerts an inhibitory effect on the transcription of the P-glycoprotein the ABCB1 multi-drug efflux pump (MDR). P-glycoprotein is overexpressed in TNBCs and analysis of the MDR reversal activities of essential oil request further analyses [

 <xref rid="pone.0214594.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In sight of this plant-derived compounds in combination with classical chemotherapeutic agents could be more efficient in the treatment of TNBCs, possibly with lesser side effects.
