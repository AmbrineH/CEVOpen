Based on these data, it could be hypothesized that the biological activities of essential oil in our TNBC cells, are accountable mainly to phytol which in combination with other terpenoids can act with synergic effects. On the other hand, the antitumor activity of this compound has been already described by Islam

There are other evidences that showed how the immunomodulatory and antitumor effects of the Phytol can be attributed precisely to the action on NF-ÎºB [
