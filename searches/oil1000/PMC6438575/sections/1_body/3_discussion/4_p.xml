<p class="p">Many plant-derived active principles have gained attention as efficient anticancer agents against TNBCs, with fewer adverse side effects. In this work for the first time we described the strongly inhibitory effect of

 <italic class="italic">juttae</italic> essential oil on NF-ÎºB activation in two TNBC cell lines characterized by a strong expression of the transcriptional factor. Consequently, the inhibition of transcriptional activity due to essential oil leads to a significant decrease of some transcriptional target genes such as Survivin, XIAP, Bcl-2 and P-glycoprotein [
