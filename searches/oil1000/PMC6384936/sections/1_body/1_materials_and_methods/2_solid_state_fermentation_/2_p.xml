<p id="Par10" class="p">Whole fresh PK was crushed down into pieces (particle size 4–8 mm) by using a hammer. The crushed PK of 400 g was transferred to a glass container, to which 250 g deionized (DI) water was added and mixed with PK. The mixture was autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. The yeast preculture was added to the sterilized PK at 1% v/w (with the initial 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> being approximate 5 log CFU/g of wet PK) and incubated at 20 °C for 72 h. Aerobic condition within the container was maintained by ensuring sufficient headspace (bed height: 4–5 cm; headspace: 3–4 cm) and by mixing the substrate bed every 12 h to introduce oxygen during sampling under aseptic conditions. Uninoculated, autoclaved PK incubated under the same conditions served as the control, while fresh, unheated PK served as the blank. All treatments were prepared in triplicate.
