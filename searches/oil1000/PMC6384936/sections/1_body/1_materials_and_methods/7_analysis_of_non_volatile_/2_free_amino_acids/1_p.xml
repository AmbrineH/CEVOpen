<p id="Par16" class="p">1.0 g of defatted PK powder was used for free amino acids extraction by 1% trichloroacetic acid. Derivatization of the extracts was conducted by Waters AccQ-Tag system (Waters Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). Following derivatization, the extracts were separated by using Shimadzu UFLC (Kyoto, Japan) on a Waters AccQ-Tag Nova- Pak C18 column (150 × 3.9 mm, Waters, Dublin, Ireland) and detected by photodiode array detector (PDA). The detailed methodology used for free amino acid analysis is described in Zhang
