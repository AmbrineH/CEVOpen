<p id="Par15" class="p">PK powders with a uniform particle size were obtained after grinding and sifting through a No. 40 USA standard testing sieve (Fisher Scientific, Leicestershire, UK) before defatting. After defatting, 2.0 g of PK powder was extracted twice with 80% (v/v) ethanol and the extracts were combined and concentrated to 2 mL. Soluble sugars in the concentrated extract were analyzed by Shimadzu ultrafast liquid chromatography system (UFLC, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a low temperature evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The detailed method used for soluble sugar extraction and analysis can be found in Zhang
