 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> NCYC 2904 was purchased from National Collection of Yeast Cultures (NCYC) (Norwich, UK). It was propagated in sterile yeast malt (YM) broth (2% glucose, 0.25% yeast extract, 0.25% bacteriological peptone and 0.2% malt extract, all w/v, pH 5.0) at 30 °C for 48 h under aerobic conditions to obtain a pure culture with a cell population of about 7 log CFU/mL. Glycerol was added to the pure culture at 15% v/v and it was stored at −80 °C before use.
