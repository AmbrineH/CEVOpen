<p id="Par11" class="p">Sampling was conducted every 12 h for the determination of viable yeast cell counts. Four gram of PK were added to 36 mL of 0.1% w/v sterilized peptone water and the mixture was homogenized for 90 s. The homogenized mixture was appropriately diluted and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates, which were then incubated at 25 °C for 48 h before yeast enumeration. At least two samples were taken from each container to obtain an average count.</p>
