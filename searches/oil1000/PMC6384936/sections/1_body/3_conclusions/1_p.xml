 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> fermentation of PK modified the volatile profile of the obtained PKO after kernel roasting. Due to the robust proteolytic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic>, more free amino acids were released after fermentation, which impacted the formation of volatile compounds by influencing the Maillard reaction and Strecker degradation especially with intensified roast degrees. More Strecker aldehydes and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-heterocyclic compounds were formed in PKO derived from fermented PK after medium and dark roast, giving the obtained PKO a different volatile profile and hence distinguished sensory attributes. Besides, the catabolism of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> brought some special volatile compounds to PKO such as 2-phenylethanol. However, the lipases of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> aggravated the hydrolysis of fat and released a large amount of free fatty acids, which might have contributed to the off-flavor being perceived in the PKO. Furthermore, the free fatty acids may have rendered a more intense oxidation during heating and the oxidation products interfered with the Maillard reaction and hence impacting the generation of volatile compounds. Nevertheless, the approach of combining fermentation with roasting provides a novel way to modulate the volatile composition of PKO. However, optimization of this approach by monitoring fermentation degrees, enzyme activities, roasting levels, among others, should be conducted in future study with the aim to enhance the formation of preferable aroma compounds while reducing undesirable ones.
