<p id="Par5" class="p">Given the fact that 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> has the robust characteristics in providing aroma compounds and aroma precursors in various types of food substrates, it is expected that solid-state fermentation of PK by 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> is able to module the volatile profile of PKO after kernel roasting, which has never been reported before. Thus, this study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the feasibility of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> fermentation for the aroma modification/enhancement of PKO.
