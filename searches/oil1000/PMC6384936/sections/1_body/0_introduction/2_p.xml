<p id="Par3" class="p">Our previous studies demonstrated that increasing the thermal reaction reactants such as free amino acids and reducing sugars in PK, by using either a commercial carbohydrase or a protease/peptidase can effectively modify the volatile profiles of roasted PK and the corresponding PKO

 </sup>. Other than using commercial enzymes, fermentation is another natural approach that is expected to produce diverse aroma compounds and modify precursors, due to a wide array of extracellular enzymes especially hydrolases that could be produced by microorganisms
