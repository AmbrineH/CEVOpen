 </sup>. It is present in different types of foods due to its nutritional versatility and physiological aspects, being distinguished for its capacity to secrete several enzymes to culture media: namely, two proteases (alkaline extracellular protease and acid extracellular protease), several lipases and phosphatases, a RNase and an esterase
