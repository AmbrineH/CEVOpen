<p id="Par26" class="p">After light roast, small amounts of xylose, arabinose and maltose (all of which was not found before roasting) were released in PKs (blank, control and/or fermented), probably due to the thermal breakdown of polysaccharides; they were subsequently consumed when roast degree proceeded. This is also true for fructose, glucose, sucrose and mannose, the concentration of which declined clearly after different degrees of roasting. As key Maillard reaction and caramelization reactants, they most probably participated in these thermal reactions which further contributed to the generation of aroma compounds
