<p id="Par24" class="p">The content of soluble sugars in the blank, control and fermented PK subjected to various roast degrees was determined and the results are presented in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. When comparing the sugar contents in the control PK to that in the blank PK, it was found that autoclaving had induced some changes to the sugar profile with higher amounts being noticed in fructose and glucose in the control PK, respectively, which might be due to the thermal degradation of polysaccharides during autoclaving.
