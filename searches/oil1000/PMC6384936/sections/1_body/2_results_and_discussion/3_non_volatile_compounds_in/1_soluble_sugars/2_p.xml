<p id="Par25" class="p">After fermentation, an obvious decline of 60% in glucose was observed as compared with the control. This is probably due to the utilization of glucose to produce compounds such as organic acids, lipids, pyruvate, and enzymes, among others, by

 </sup>. In comparison, fructose was not used by 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> as no significant change was observed. This observation was in accordance with a previous finding which showed that fructose is only used after any available glucose has been completely consumed due to the fact that the 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> hexokinase has a low affinity for fructose

 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> was probably due to the secreted mannosidases. An exo-Î±-mannosidase was characterized in
