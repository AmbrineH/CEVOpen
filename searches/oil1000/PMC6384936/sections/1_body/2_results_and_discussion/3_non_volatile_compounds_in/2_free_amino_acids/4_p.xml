<p id="Par31" class="p">When comparing the free amino acids content in the fermented PK to that in the control PK, a remarkable increment in concentration was found in almost all individual amino acids after 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> fermentation; the total free amino acid concentration has increased by 7-fold. This increment in amino acids highlights the strong proteolytic capability of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic>, which produces both extracellular acid and alkaline proteases

 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> was also found in okara and cheese fermentation, and this is essential for cheese ripening
