<p id="Par23" class="p">In comparison, there is no significant difference in both moisture content and L* value among the blank, control and fermented PK before roasting. However, after light and medium roast, lower moisture was found in the control PK than blank and fermented PK. Meanwhile, the fermented PK had a brighter color (higher L* value), indicating weaker non-enzymatic browning occurred, likely due to the consumption of sugars by the yeast. Nevertheless, after dark roast, the difference in either moisture content or L* value among the blank, control and fermented PK disappeared.</p>
