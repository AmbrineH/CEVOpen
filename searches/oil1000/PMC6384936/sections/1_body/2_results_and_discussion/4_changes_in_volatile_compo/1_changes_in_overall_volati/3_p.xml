<p id="Par35" class="p">The most obvious change was found in volatile acids, whereby 5-fold more acids were found in the PKO produced from the fermented PK before roasting, as compared with that in the PKOs made from the blank and control PK; the higher level of acids in the fermented PKO persisted throughout the whole roasting process. Significant increases were also found in the content of aldehydes and alcohols in the fermented PKO before roasting and after roasting. On the other hand, decrease in furans was the most evident after fermentation and roasting. Furans are generally sugar breakdown products; the decline in furans in the fermented PKO implies that less sugars had been consumed and converted. Of the 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-heterocyclics, their content decreased initially (before roasting and after light roast) and elevated when the roast degree was intensified (medium and dark roast). The most representative volatile compounds are discussed in detail in the following sections.
