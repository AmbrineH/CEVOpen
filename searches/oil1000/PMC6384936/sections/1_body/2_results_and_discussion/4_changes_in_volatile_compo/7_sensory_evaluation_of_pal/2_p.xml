<p id="Par56" class="p">After light roast, the intensity of each sensory attribute in the fermented PKO is generally lower as compared with that of the control, except roasty and off-flavor. This is expected, as in comparison, fermented PKO contained fewer volatile compounds such as pyrazines, furans, furanones, pyraones and phenols, which generally represent nutty, caramelic and smoky odor. On the other hand, the fermented PKO had more free fatty acids, which could have contributed to a great extent to the off-flavor. This off-flavor perception in fermented PKO persisted to medium roast. Of medium roast, the levels of almost all volatile categories in fermented PKO caught up, making its each sensory attribute exceed that of the control but comparable to the blank, except the burnt note. Moreover, its higher levels of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-heterocyclic compounds help to impart it a more nutty and roasty characteristic. This phenomenon almost continued when roast proceeded to the dark level. In addition, after dark roast, the off-flavor in fermented PKO could not be detected although there was still a large amount of free fatty acids present. This is probably due to the masking of other heightened aroma attributes such as smoky and roasty.
