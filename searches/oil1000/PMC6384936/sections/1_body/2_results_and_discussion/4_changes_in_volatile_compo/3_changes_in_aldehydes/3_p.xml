<p id="Par41" class="p">After roasting, obvious increases in benzeneacetaldehyde and 3-methyl butanal were found in PKO for light roast and medium roast. A high level of 2-methyl propanal was also found in the fermented PKO with medium roast. All of these compounds are Strecker aldehydes, originating from their amino acid precursors during heating. 3-Methyl butanal with a malt-like sensation could be formed through reactions between leucine and dicarbonyl compounds

 </sup>. Similarly, benzeneacetaldehyde with a floral odor could be generated from its precursor phenylalanine whereas 2-methyl propanal with floral and malty odors might have originated from valine

 </sup>. Higher levels of the aforementioned aldehydes found in fermented PKO might be due to the elevated contents of their respective amino acid precursors.
