 </sup>. When heated, yeast cells are supposed to collapse and degrade eventually and fragments such as saccharides, proteins and lipids would participate in thermal reactions and interact with other ingredients, which will result in the generation of some aroma compounds. However, we believe this might not have contributed significantly to the final volatile profile in this study. It is known that sulfur-containing odorants, such as 5-methylfurfurylthiol, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 2,2-furfurylthiol or 3-mercapto-2-butanone, have been identified as the most important aroma compounds in thermally treated yeast extracts

 </sup>, all of which were not found in our study (data not shown). In addition, thermal reactions of yeast extract give a typical meat-like and savory flavor, which was also not detected in sensory evaluation.
