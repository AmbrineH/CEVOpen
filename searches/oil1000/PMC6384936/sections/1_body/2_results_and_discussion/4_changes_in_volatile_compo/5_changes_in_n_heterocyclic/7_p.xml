<p id="Par50" class="p">Another explanation would be that the generation pathway of 
 <italic class="italic">N-</italic>heterocyclics had been interfered by the participation of lipid oxidation products. A previous study found that the generation of pyrazines in xylose-lysine and glucose-lysine model systems appeared to be particularly sensitive to the presence of the vegetable oils such as olive, canola, and sunflower oils during thermal treatment, implying that the thermal oxidation products of these unsaturated fats may affect the generation of pyrazines, although the exact underlying mechanism was not provided by the authors

 </sup>. In the current study, lipolysis by 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> released more free fatty acids, which are more susceptible to oxidation than esterified fatty acids

 </sup>. Under such a situation, more lipid oxidation products would have been produced in fermented PK and PKO than that in control and blank PK and PKO. The oxidation of lipids produces a variety of aldehydes that can participate in carbonyl-amine condensation and aldol condensations, effectively competing with reducing sugars and reactive intermediates in Maillard reaction for amino groups

 </sup>. As such, the formation of pyrazines and pyrroles was negatively affected.
