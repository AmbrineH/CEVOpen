<p id="Par52" class="p">It should be noted that, autolysis of yeast during fermentation might have released some aroma precursors such as amino acids, peptides, lipids, polysaccharides, nucleotides and nucleosides, which would in turn impact the aroma composition in obtained PKO after roasting, however, in our view, to a low extent

 </sup>. It is known that autolysis usually occurs at the end of stationary growth phase when the fermentable carbon sources are almost depleted and is normally associated with cell death
