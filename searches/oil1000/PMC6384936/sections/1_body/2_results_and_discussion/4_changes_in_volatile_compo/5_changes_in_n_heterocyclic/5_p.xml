<p id="Par48" class="p">It is known that the formation of pyrazines and pyrroles is highly correlated with free amino acids. For example, alkyl pyrazines are known to be formed from the reaction of Î±-diketones with amino acids via Strecker degradation

 </sup>. However, even though much more free amino acids were found in the fermented PK, the contents of pyrazines and pyrroles found in fermented PKO were not correspondingly higher, especially at light roast level, which is unexpected.
