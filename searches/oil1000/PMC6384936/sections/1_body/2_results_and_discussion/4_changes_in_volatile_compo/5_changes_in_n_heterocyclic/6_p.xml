<p id="Par49" class="p">One explanation would be that the release of free fatty acids and the possible synthesis of other non-volatile organic acids would have lowered the pH in the fermented PK hence mitigating the generation of pyrazines. Most steps in the Maillard reaction are sensitive to pH, and small changes in pH can alter the aroma profile

 </sup>. It is generally known that pH has an impact on the generation of pyrazines, hindering their formation at low pH due to the protonation of the amino groups of the amino acids and peptides
