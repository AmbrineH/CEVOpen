<p id="Par54" class="p">PCA was carried out on the basis of all volatile categories with the aim to gain a comprehensive comparison of the aroma profile of PKOs with different pretreatments and with different roast degrees. The first two PCs accounted for 75.47% of total variability in the dataset, with PC1 and PC2 accounting for 51.79% and 23.68%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Before roasting, the three types of PKO shared a similarity, all of which were negatively correlated with PC1 and PC2. However, after roasting, PCA clearly discriminated the fermented PKO with various kernel roasting degrees from the control and blank PKO; they differed from each other by having an opposite direction at PC2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The profiles of control and blank PKO with various roast degrees are similar to each other. Specifically, the PKO from light roasted and fermented PK was more correlated with acids, alcohols and aliphatic aldehydes. After medium and dark roast, fermented PKO tended to be dominated by aromatic aldehydes, pyrroles, pyrazines and furanones. This indicates that, PKO made from fermented PK after different levels of roasting represents a different volatile profile as compared to the control and blank PKO.
