<p id="Par37" class="p">One noticeable observation is the content of acetic acid, which declined by 14-fold in PKO immediately after fermentation relative to that of the control and blank PKO (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>). Acetic acid might be consumed by the yeast during fermentation, as previous studies have shown that 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> is able to use acetic acid as the sole carbon and energy source

 </sup>. Meanwhile, remarkable increases were found in other free fatty acids, with butanoic, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic and dodecanoic acids being the most representative. Besides proteases discussed above, 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> is distinguished for its capacity to secrete several lipases, depending on media composition and environmental conditions; the extracellular lipases are able to hydrolyse triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol

 </sup>. The lipolytic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> is considered very important to the quality of sausage, since the produced free fatty acids and their degradation products such as methyl ketones are substrates responsible for typical aroma development

 <italic class="italic">Y. lipolytica</italic> to release free fatty acids in cheese ripening largely determines the flavor of some dairy products such as smear-ripened cheeses
