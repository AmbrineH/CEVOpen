<p class="p">Essential oils are mixtures of complex and fragrant substances, employed in many applicative fields, from aromatherapy to medicine and pharmacy, as well as the agro-food industry and phytoiatry [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The applicative importance of essential oils in such diversified fields relies mainly on their chemical characterization as mixtures of low molecular weight lipophilic substances and on their biological properties often due to synergistic effects of two or more constituents [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In fact, many research papers about essential oils focus on their chemical portrait and in vitro biological properties in terms of antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities with the aim of detecting the most performance. One of the most interesting chemical aspects, emerging from all these researches, is their high chemodiversity, i.e., different composition, sometimes even dramatic, among phytocomplex from plants belonging to the same species, but grown in different geographical conditions and biodiversity contexts. This aspect is more evident for those species from areas characterized by high biodiversity, where the interaction among a higher number of different species results in a propulsive tool for secondary metabolites which give rise to remarkable molecular diversity and abundance in plants [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Biological activities of essential oils, instead, independently of the methodological target, are particularly focused on the detection of the compounds responsible of the activity and on the detection and quantification of possible synergistic evidences [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Among several kinds of biological activities, cytotoxic and antioxidant are the most interesting since the results could lead to deepened research about chemical compounds and/or chemical platforms for new pharmaceutical treatments of inflammation-related diseases, such as cancers [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Given all these premises, a chemical and bioactivity study has been performed on the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Myrcia splendens</italic> (Sw.) DC. (syn. 
 <italic class="italic">M. fallax</italic> (Rich.) DC.) (Myrtaceae) obtained from plants grown in Amazonian Ecuador. Many neotropical Myrtaceae species are known for their traditional health uses, but some of them are scarcely investigated under the chemical point of view and as source of bioactive compounds. Fresh aerial parts of species belonging to 
 <italic class="italic">Myrcia</italic> genus are employed in South American traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, diarrhea, hemorrhage as infusion, and as a compress to treat inflammation and skin infections [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Myrcia splendens</italic> is a tree found in neotropic regions, distributed from Eastern Mexico to the South-Eastern Brazilian coastal forests. Crude drugs, derivatives, and preparations from Peruvian [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and Brazilian plants have been studied and interesting cytotoxic activities were evidenced [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Since the Amazonian basin is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots world-wide, a first report on chemical characterization and biological properties of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> from Ecuador was performed, with the aim to compare our data with those already reported by related literature.
