<p class="p">These sesquiterpenes are present at low amount in the essential oil and that may be the reason for the low antioxidant activity. In addition, other explanation could be that antioxidant activity is reduced by some compounds which exhibits oxidant activity. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by previous research related to the evaluation of cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Piper gaudichaudianum</italic> Kunth essential oil, rich in 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol, against 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The cytotoxic effect increased according to the absence of the superoxide dismutase (SOD), indicating that essential oil and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol developed reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production was confirmed by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein dictate (DCF-DA) test, on strains that do not produce the SOD enzyme. Cytotoxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. gaudichaudianum</italic> essential oil and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol depends on ROS and DNA single strand breaks generated by presence of oxidative lesions [

 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol found in Ecuadorian 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil could explain the weak antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay.
