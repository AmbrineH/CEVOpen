<p class="p">According to these results, 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil may be considered a promissory product to be used for innovative therapeutic or preventive strategies against breast carcinoma. Its cytotoxic activity may depend on the presence of α-bisabolol, which showed a very interesting IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value after 48 h (1.24 ± 0.03 µg/mL). Previous studies on α-bisabolol exhibited cytotoxic activity against glioma, pancreatic, ovarian, and kidney carcinoma cells [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Furthermore, it was reported as a chemopreventive agent in rat mammary carcinogenesis [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Thus the high content of α-bisabolol (17.51%) in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil could explain the cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells. On the other hand, data obtained on A549 were less interesting because the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (27.63 ± 2.01 μg/mL) was very close to 30 μg/mL, the concentration considered as the upper limit for potential chemopreventive activity. In the present study, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol exhibited a cytotoxic activity less interesting than α-bisabolol, nevertheless on A549 cells showed IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value at 48 h (54.28 ± 2.39 μg/mL) in line with the one recorded by Sylvestre et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] (66 ± 12 μg/mL). Antineoplastic activity was also recorded on bowel by a mixture of 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>- and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], suggesting that deeper studies could be carried out in order to assess cytotoxic activity against other kinds of cancer cell lines.
