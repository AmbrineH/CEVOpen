<p class="p">Moreover, at the concentration of 10 µg/mL, α-bisabolol decreased the viability of A549, MCF-7, and HaCaT cell lines of 70%, 10% and 50%, respectively, in comparison with the negative control. The results highlighted that inhibition on cell growth was highly dependent on cell type with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values ranging from 1.24 ± 0.03 to 100.99 ± 2.32 μg/mL. In particular, MCF-7 cancer cells showed more growth inhibition than HaCaT cells after 48 h of treatment with α-bisabolol (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.24 ± 0.03 μg/mL vs. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 10.15 ± 0.35 μg/mL) and essential oil (IC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> ranging from 54.28 ± 2.39 to 100.99 ± 2.32 μg/mL. Therefore, the evaluation of the cytotoxic activity revealed promising results in terms of selectivity and efficacy of
