<p class="p">However, results obtained indicated that phytopathogens strains were more sensitive than human pathogens after treatment with the tested essential oil. In particular, the Gram positive C. 
 <italic class="italic">michiganensis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">nebraskensis</italic> resulted the most sensitivity, evidencing the lowest MIC value of 125 μg/mL. Gram negative bacteria showed resistance to

 <sub class="sub">f</sub> 0.6 and R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> 0.7. The R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> 0.45–R

 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol (100%). The fraction R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> 0.7 was mainly composed by β-cedren-9-one (87.34%). Data obtained suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol is mainly responsible for the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil that is in accordance with the results obtained by various authors. Simoes et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] found that

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and
