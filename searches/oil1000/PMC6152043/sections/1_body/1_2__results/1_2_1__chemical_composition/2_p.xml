<p class="p">Twenty-two compounds were characterized, corresponding to 97.84% of the total. Sesquiterpenes were predominant and particularly oxygenated sesquiterpenes, corresponding to 85.47% of the total. Monoterpenes, α- and β-pinene, were present in a lower amount (2.19% as total). Among the sesquiterpenes the most abundant were 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol (67.81%), α-bisabolol (17.51%) and β-caryophyllene (4.21%). The predominance of sesquiterpenes is peculiar to the 
 <italic class="italic">Myrcia</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic class="italic">M. fallax</italic>) essential oil exhibited a different composition compared to related studies on the same species. In fact, Henriques et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] found α-bisabolol (83%) as the main compound, while Nakamura et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] found it to be α-bisabolene (80%); Alarcón et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] stated that guaiol (31%) and carotol (9.9%) were the most abundant constituents. β-elemene was found as the main compound in the study of Lima et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and α-pinene characterized the essential oil obtained by Pereira et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol was the main compound (80.8%) of 
 <italic class="italic">M. bracteata</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol was found only in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> species of the present study. β-caryophyllene was already detected in 
 <italic class="italic">M. glabra</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. multiflora</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. cuprea,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. tomentosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and α-pinene in 
 <italic class="italic">M. bombycina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. myrtifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. A deep inter- and intraspecific diversity in chemical composition of Myrtaceae essential oils has been reported by various authors. Data obtained on 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil from Ecuador seem to confirm this hypothesis. Previous studies suggested that intraspecific diversity of Myrtaceae terpene profiles could be a response of adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions, in particular the monoterpene: sesquiterpene ratio seems to be influenced by the efficiency of terpene synthases enzymes [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Obtained results indicate that endogenous factors, as high genetic diversity, have more influence on the volatile oil variability of Myrtaceae family than environmental aspects [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-22-01163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In particular, the differences observed in chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oils could also depend on Amazonian origin of the studied samples. In effect, the high biodiversity of Amazonian region induces plant secondary metabolism to biosynthetic pathways characterized by diversified chemical profile [
