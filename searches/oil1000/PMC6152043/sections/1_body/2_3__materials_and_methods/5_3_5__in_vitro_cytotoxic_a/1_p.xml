<p class="p">The cytotoxic activity was performed on A549 (human lung cancer cell line), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell line), and HaCaT (human keratinocytes) purchased at “Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell’Emilia-Romagna” (Brescia, Italy) and it was expressed as the concentration of sample that inhibited 50% of cell growth (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>). The cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. They were grown in 75 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> flasks in an air atmosphere characterized by 5% humidity and 95% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37 °C, until 80% confluence was reached. Cytotoxic activity was determined by MTT colorimetric assay [

 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well in 200 µL DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) complete medium; a period of 24 h was given for ensuring the cell attachment. Then the culture medium was replaced with 200 µL medium containing different concentrations (from 1 to 200 µg/mL) of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil. In order to understand the role of α-bisabolol and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol in the cytotoxic activity, commercially available standards of those compounds were tested following the same methodology. Negative control was exposed to vehicle only, corresponding to a medium containing 2% FBS. The positive control used was doxorubicin. After 48 h, the culture medium was removed and washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) twice. A lather of 20 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added in each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with 100 μL of dimethylsulfoxide to dissolve the formazan crystals. The extent of MTT reduction was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm using a microplate reader.
