<p class="p">Ten microliters of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil was dissolved into 900 µL of ethanol, then serial dilutions were assessed in order to obtain different concentrations (0.8–6.67 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup> μL/mL). An aliquot (2.9 mL) of the ethanol solution of DPPH (4 mg/100 mL) was added to the essential oil solution. After a 30 min incubation, in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm, in the dark at room temperature, the mixture was placed in an UV-Vis spectrophotometer and the absorbance was read in triplicate against a blank at 517 nm. The DPPH inhibition in percent was determined by the following formula: IDPPH% = [1 − (A1/A2)] × 100. Where A1 was the DPPH absorbance with the essential oil and A2 without the essential oil. Vitamin E was used as positive control, according to its well-known antioxidant properties [

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (concentration providing DPPH 50% inhibition), calculated from inhibition curves obtained by plotting inhibition percentage against essential oil concentration. All experiments were assessed in triplicate and values were reported as mean ± SD (Standard Deviation).
