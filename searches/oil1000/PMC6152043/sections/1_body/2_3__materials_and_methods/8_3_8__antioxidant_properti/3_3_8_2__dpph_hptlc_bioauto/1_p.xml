<p class="p">DPPH-HPTLC-bioautography was assessed to determine the active compounds of the essential oil, responsible for possible radical scavenging activity. Twelve microliters of an ethanol solution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil (110 mg/mL) were applied twice to a silica gel HPTLC plate as 10 mm wide bands with Linomat V. Then, spots were eluted with a solvent solution (toluene/ethyl acetate/petroleum ether 93/7/20) in a chromatographic chamber. After development, the first chromatogram was sprayed with the DPPH ethanol solution (20 mg/100 mL) to detect possible antioxidant fractions. The active compounds appeared as yellow areas on a violet background. Isolation and identification of antioxidant compounds were carried out removing the TLC areas in the second chromatogram at R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> corresponding to positive spots and then extracting them with methanol. The solutions were analyzed by GC-MS. The third plate obtained from HPTLC bioautographic assay was used to show 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol and Î±-bisabolol as reference standards.
