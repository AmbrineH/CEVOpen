Serial dilutions were prepared in order to obtain concentration ranges from 27 μg/mL to 2000 µg/mL. One hundred μL of bacterial culture standardized to 2 × 10

After the incubation period, 40 μL of water solution (20 mg/mL) of 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride was added to each well and then incubated. Microbial growth was checked by a microplate reader at 615 nm, after 30 min of incubation. Chloramphenicol was used as a positive control [
