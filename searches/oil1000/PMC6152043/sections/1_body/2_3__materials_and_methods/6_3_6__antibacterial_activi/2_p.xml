<p class="p">The HPTLC bioautography was carried out on human pathogen 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, with the aim of defining particular constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil that are able to determine the antibacterial activity. The bacterium choice was led because of its high performance features on HPTLC plate assay. The assay was performed as follows: 30 μL of a solution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil (110 mg/mL in ethanol) were applied on two separate HPTLC plates as 10 mm wide bands with Linomat V (Camag), while 10 μL of a methanol solution of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol (25 mg/mL) and 10 μL of a methanol solution of α-bisabolol (8 mg/mL) were applied on a third one on the same spot, as a 10 mm wide band. Then, all plates were eluted with a solvent solution containing toluene/ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (93/7/20). Finally, the solvent was completely dried maintaining plates for 30 min at room temperature: the first one was disposed in Petri dishes together with Nutrient Agar medium previously added with the bacterial inoculum (10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/50 mL) and 0.25% of a 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride water solution (20 mg/mL), as a growth indicator. Incubation occurred overnight at 37 °C. Antibacterial compounds, responsible for possible antibacterial properties, looked like yellow spots against a red colored background. The second plate was used to remove active spots on silica and to extract these in methanol solutions that was directly analyzed by GC-MS, while the third one was sprayed with vanillin-phosphoric acid reagent to visualize
