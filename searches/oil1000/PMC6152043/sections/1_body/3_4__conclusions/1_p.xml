<p class="p">The present study characterized the chemical profile of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil from Ecuador for the first time and investigated its cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. The essential oil of this plant revealed a good potential against the MCF-7 cell line and suggested that further deeper investigations of in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer studies are needed. 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil showed negligible antioxidant activity and low antibacterial effects against Gram positive and negative human pathogens, and moderate activity against phytopathogen strains. In addition, it was found that the chemical characterization of 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil from Amazonian Ecuador differs qualitatively and quantitatively from essential oils obtained by plants obtained of the same species but coming from different regions. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">M. splendens</italic> essential oil, as a source of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-nerolidol, should have pharmacological applications because of its enhancing properties on improving skin absorption of a drug with low lipophilic features [
