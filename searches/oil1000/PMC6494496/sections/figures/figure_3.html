 <p> Fe solubility versus Fe concentration (ng m −3) for field data and models over the North Atlantic. The colors for field data ( A) represent percentage contributions of labile Fe to the sum of less labile and labile Fe concentrations in aerosols. The colors for the models ( B to D) represent the simulated contribution of combustion aerosols to the sum of combustion and dust aerosols to labile Fe. The field data in light gray color represent no data for the 25% acetic acid leach. The aerosol samples are classified as sourced by two different air masses from North Africa (triangles) or other air mass regimes (circles) including North America, Europe, marine (no interaction with major land masses within 5 days before sample collection), or high latitudes (air masses originating north of 50°N) ( 23 ). </p>
