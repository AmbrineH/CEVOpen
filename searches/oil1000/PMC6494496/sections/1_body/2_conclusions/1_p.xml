<p class="p">The models need to consider the emissions of pyrogenic Fe-containing aerosols and their atmospheric transformation to simulate the high Fe solubility at low total aerosol Fe concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere. We found that the models did not reproduce the high Fe solubility over the Southern Ocean, suggesting potentially missing sources of pyrogenic Fe-containing aerosols and their dissolution processes. Further investigations of processes enhancing Fe solubility are needed in aerosols, rain (liquid cloud), and snow (ice cloud) over the oceans. A standard analytical method for assessing aerosol Fe solubility for polluted and clean environments is a high priority for future studies. Furthermore, our study suggests that assessments of atmospheric fluxes of labile Fe to the open oceans should consider Fe-containing aerosols emanating from both pyrogenic and lithogenic sources for accurately predicting anthropogenic perturbations to oceanic nutrient biogeochemistry.</p>
