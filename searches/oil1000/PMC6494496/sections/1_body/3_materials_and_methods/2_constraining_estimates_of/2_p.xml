<p class="p">Using the probability function of the MLEs of Fe concentration assuming a normal distribution (MATLAB function), the weighted averages and SDs of Fe concentration and solubility were calculated. The a posteriori data were used as simulated estimates for the comparison with the measurements when MLEs of Fe concentration fell within ±2σ
