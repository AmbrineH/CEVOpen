<p class="p">We therefore suggest some mechanisms to explain these high solubilities. Pyrogenic Fe, which can be transformed to labile Fe during atmospheric processing, may play an important role in providing labile Fe to the Southern Ocean. However, further studies are required to identify and quantify such aerosol sources in the Southern Hemisphere (

 </xref>). The higher solubility may originate from aerosol interactions with emissions from open biomass burning, which is common in the Southern Hemisphere (

  <italic class="italic">34</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, aerosols originating from land can experience atmospheric processing over longer periods than in the Northern Hemisphere. An additional possibility is that some Fe dissolution processes may be missing from the models. For instance, dissolution of nanosized colloidal Fe oxides in ice is not taken into account in our models (

 </xref>). Thus, we recommend ice-enhanced dissolution experiments of representative combustion aerosols (e.g., biomass burning aerosols and volcanic ashes) under conditions relevant to ice particles in the atmosphere over the Southern Ocean. Studies of stable Fe isotopes may offer additional constraints on the contribution from combustion sources to aerosol Fe (
