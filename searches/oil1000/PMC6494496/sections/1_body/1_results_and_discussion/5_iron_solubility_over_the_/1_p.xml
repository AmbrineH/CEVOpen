<p class="p">Observations of Fe solubility near coastal areas may be affected by regional anthropogenic emissions, whereas those over the remote ocean may be influenced more by atmospheric processing during long-range transport. Over the Southern Ocean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>), none of the models was able to reproduce the high Fe solubility (&gt;10%) occasionally reported for aerosols (12 of 42 samples), because there is no aerosol Fe dissolution mechanism under high-pH and low-oxalate conditions in IMPACT, TM4-ECPL, and GEOS-Chem. Additionally, the high Fe solubility of the field data in the Southern Ocean exceeds the sum of labile and less labile solubility (6.0 ± 1.0%) for North African dust (

 </xref>) and the Fe solubility in glacial weathering products (2 to 3%) (

  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, such a wide range of solubility (from 0.2 to 48%) in this region as derived from observations cannot be explained by considering only chemical aging of mineral dust aerosol as measured in the laboratory. Different types of Fe-containing minerals such as pyrogenic Fe oxides must be considered in conjunction with additional aerosol processing such as plume chemistry to achieve these high solubilities. Moreover, averaged labile Fe concentration from all modeled estimates (0.065 ± 0.078 ng m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) underestimates the observed mean over the Southern Ocean (0.967 ± 1.049 ng m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) by a factor of 15.
