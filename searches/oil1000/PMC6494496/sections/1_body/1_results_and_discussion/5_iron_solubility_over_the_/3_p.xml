<p class="p">Uncertainty in aerosol Fe solubility stems from the scarcity of observations in the Southern Hemisphere. There are fewer field data in the Southern Hemisphere, which are sparsely distributed and collected over longer sampling periods during research cruises, partly due to low concentration of aerosols. Thus, these results should be interpreted with a degree of caution. We suggest that more observations are needed before drawing any firm conclusions on the Fe solubility and the models’ performance in the Pacific, Indian, and Southern oceans. The high solubility in regions of low Fe concentration (&lt;100 ng m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) was thought to be a robust feature of all the available data regardless of the leaching methods. However, low Fe solubilities were also found at low Fe concentrations over the Southern Ocean (

Given the key role of the Southern Ocean in the Earth system, it is important to gain a better understanding of pyrogenic and lithogenic Fe sources in the region alongside improved understanding of atmospheric processing of Fe-containing aerosols to resolve these discrepancies between model estimates and field data.
