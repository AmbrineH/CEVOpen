<p class="p">Observations from the northern Indian Ocean provide a valuable dataset to evaluate model performance, as Fe solubilities in aerosols sampled over the Bay of Bengal are considerably higher than those sampled over the neighboring Arabian Sea (

 </xref>). IMPACT, TM4-ECPL, and the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4), all of which include combustion aerosols, show to some extent the contrast between high Fe solubility in the Bay of Bengal and low solubility in the Arabian Sea, while the Goddard Earth Observing System with Chemistry (GEOS-Chem) model, which does not include combustion aerosols, shows lower Fe solubility over the Bay of Bengal. However, there are large differences regarding the relative importance of different sources of labile Fe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), due to differences in the relative source strength of dust and combustion Fe, and in solubility estimates for dust and combustion aerosols in the models. All models overestimate the low values of the Fe solubility in field data over the Arabian Sea by more than a factor of 10. This is primarily due to the prescribed solubility of labile Fe for dust aerosols in the models at their primary emissions and the subsequent enhancement of Fe solubility estimated from the simulated amount of atmospheric processing during transport in the models. We note that the low solubilities of the field data are outliers (triangles in fig. S5) in the modeled Fe solubility versus the field data. The Fe solubility from the field data used in this study (0.08 ± 0.09%) is significantly lower than those reported by other research groups over the Arabian Sea [1.4 ± 0.5% (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">39</italic>
 </xref>) and 0.4 ± 1.0% (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">40</italic>
 </xref>)]. These differences in the Fe solubility between investigators presumably reflect methodological and analytical differences in the measurements; these uncertainties could potentially be resolved if standard methods and reference material analysis were used by different investigators.
