<p class="p">The high Fe solubility (&gt;10%) at low Fe concentration in the data was successfully simulated only by the IMPACT model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The IMPACT model results suggest that combustion aerosols substantially contribute to labile Fe concentrations (&gt;90%, red color in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and fig. S5). These results support the argument that the source-dependent composition of aerosols is an important factor in controlling the sporadically high Fe solubility (&gt;10%) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, mainly because of faster deposition rates for labile Fe than those for total Fe from combustion sources and the absence of the Fe dissolution process for combustion aerosols in TM4-ECPL. Moreover, the IMPACT model prescribed lower initial Fe solubility but simulated high solubility at low concentrations due to Fe released from Fe-containing combustion aerosols during transport. These results suggest that agreements with field data depend not only on the source chemical composition but also on the atmospheric processing during transport. The apparent deviation of Fe solubility in IMPACT from the 1-to-1 ratio is possibly due to the prescribed Fe solubility at emission by the arithmetic mean of field data for oil fly ashes (58 Â± 22%) (fig. S5) (

  <italic class="italic">27</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>). This suggests that IMPACT may need to resolve the actual variability in the degree of aerosol Fe lability at emission and in the subsequent atmospheric processes to better represent the aerosol source characteristics.
