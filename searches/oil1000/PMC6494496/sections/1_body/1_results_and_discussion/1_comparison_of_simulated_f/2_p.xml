<p class="p">The ordinary arithmetic averages of simulated Fe solubility and weighted arithmetic averages of Fe solubility by simulated Fe concentration from the models are compared with the field data in table S3. The weighted mean values are calculated from the cumulated values of labile Fe and total Fe for all data points. The minimum (Min), maximum (Max), number of data points, mean error (Error), root mean square errors (RMSE), mean bias (Bias), and correlation coefficient (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) of Fe solubility between the model results and field data are also listed in table S3. The field data show a wider variability in Fe solubility compared to those in simulated Fe solubility under different conditions, ranging from the minimum (0.02%) to the maximum (98%) with an SD of 8.2 for the arithmetic averages. For each model, the arithmetic average of Fe solubility weighted by the total Fe concentration for all grid points with available observations, and its SD are lower than the corresponding ordinary arithmetic average of the Fe solubilities for the same grid points. This reflects the fact that high Fe concentrations with low solubilities near mineral dust source regions contribute more to the Fe concentrations than others such as combustion aerosols and aged mineral dust aerosols that are sampled over remote regions. The ratios of arithmetic averages to weighted averages for the field data (5.0) and the ratios of their SDs (104) are more consistent with those of the Integrated Massively Parallel Atmospheric Chemical Transport (IMPACT) model when considering both combustion aerosols and mineral dust (5.1 and 115) than those with mineral dust only (1.9 and 40) (table S3). Moreover, better agreement of the model results with the field data of labile Fe concentrations can be seen for IMPACT when considering combustion aerosols plus mineral dust than with mineral dust only (fig. S3 versus fig. S4). At the same time, IMPACT output fits the field data best (correlation coefficient of 0.38 summarized in table S3) and also has the highest solubility estimates for combustion aerosols. This suggests that enhanced and more variable aerosol Fe solubility is associated with mixing of combustion aerosols and its atmospheric processing during transport.
