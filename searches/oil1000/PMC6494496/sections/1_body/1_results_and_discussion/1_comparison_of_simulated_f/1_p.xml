<p class="p">We compiled data for total and labile aerosol Fe concentrations simulated by four models (see Materials and Methods) and from digestions and leaches of aerosol samples collected during multiple field campaigns to improve our understanding of the factors controlling solubility (fig. S1 and tables S1 and S2). We used these data to assess the variability in the solubility of aerosol Fe using a diverse range of methodologies. To reduce the uncertainties associated with source attribution, some simulated data, for which maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of total Fe concentrations do not fall within ±2σ
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> of the measurements, are not used for the comparison with field data, as is described in Materials and Methods (fig. S2 and table S2). Here, σ
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> represents the SD of Fe concentration for measurements. This procedure can eliminate the cases that result in a good agreement in labile Fe concentration by compensating the underestimates in Fe solubility with the overestimates in Fe concentration and vice versa, which would bias the relative contribution of combustion and mineral dust sources of Fe to labile Fe. Because direct association of model estimates to a specific cruise track and time period can introduce biases when used as a reference for larger regions and different time periods, the maximum likelihood method was implemented to estimate the state of the atmosphere from observations and models.
