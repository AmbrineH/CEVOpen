<p class="p">The differences in the contribution of combustion aerosols to the total deposition fluxes among model results are significantly larger for labile Fe (22% for IMPACT, 44% for TM4-ECPL, and 9.3% for CAM4) than for total Fe (2.6% for IMPACT, 7.1% for TM4-ECPL, and 3.1% for CAM4) and increase with distance from the major dust source regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). This is largely due to the differences in the assumed solubility of dust and combustion aerosols upon emission (table S1) and the subsequent enhancement of Fe solubility dynamically calculated from the simulated amount of atmospheric processing during transport. To show the sensitivity of simulated Fe solubility to atmospheric processing, the initial solubilities of 0.45% for dust and 4% for combustion aerosols (

 </xref>) are prescribed with no atmospheric processing in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref> (C, F, and I). When atmospheric processing is not considered to enhance Fe solubility, the IMPACT model shows lower contribution of combustion aerosols than that with atmospheric processing over the remote ocean, because the faster dissolution schemes at lower pH than those at higher pH primarily work for wet combustion aerosols during atmospheric transport. The IMPACT model results are reasonably consistent with observations, which indicate much more increases in aerosol Fe solubilities over the open ocean from those near sources of biomass burning and coal combustion (

 </xref>). When atmospheric processing is neglected, TM4-ECPL model shows higher contribution of combustion aerosols over the Southern Ocean, because simulated labile Fe over the ocean is due only to primary emissions (initial solubility) and labile Fe is removed faster than total Fe by wet deposition during atmospheric transport. Therefore, reducing uncertainties in model estimates of labile Fe deposition fluxes primarily requires improved parameterization for the factors that control aerosol Fe solubility (table S1) and the relative contribution of combustion aerosols to the labile fraction of aerosol Fe (
