<p class="p">The contribution of combustion aerosols to total Fe deposition flux to the ocean, as calculated by the Fe deposition fluxes originating from dust and combustion sources (figs. S6 and S7), is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>. Three models (IMPACT, TM4-ECPL, and CAM4) can calculate the contribution from combustion aerosols to total Fe and to labile Fe deposition fluxes. The models agree that mineral dust is the major source of Fe deposited to the North Atlantic, Arabian Sea, and South Atlantic downwind of the arid and semiarid regions of North Africa, the Middle East, and Patagonia (fig. S6). However, the models estimate a large range in the contribution of combustion aerosols to the deposition fluxes of total (from 2.6 to 7.1% on a global mean) and labile Fe (from 9 to 44% on a global mean) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). For total Fe, this range in estimates could be due to differences in the relative emission strengths of dust versus combustion-derived Fe (fig. S6), the mineralogical composition at the source region, the size distribution of airborne dust particles, and the meteorological data in the models (

 </xref>). Because minerals in soils differ in their Fe content, spanning from 0.2 to 70%, Fe content in aerosols depends on the database of mineral composition in clay- and silt-sized soils, and the global mean Fe content in mineral dust emissions ranges from 2.6 to 3.5% (
