<p class="p">The large body of available field data on aerosol Fe over the North Atlantic offers another useful area in which to compare the models. Air mass back trajectories (AMBTs) were used to classify the source regions and transport pathways for the aerosol samples collected over the North Atlantic (

 </xref>). However, AMBTs were not sufficiently discriminating to identify the aerosol sources or the potential effects of atmospheric processing on Fe solubility (

 </xref>). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, the aerosol samples are classified as sourced by air masses from North Africa or other air mass regimes (

 </xref>). The “degree of atmospheric processing” from the field data can be derived from the ratio of Fe solubility derived from two different leaching methods (see Materials and Methods) (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>). All models calculate that mineral dust was the major source of labile Fe at high total Fe concentrations for samples largely influenced by North African air masses and reproduced the low solubility of 0.4 ± 0.1% of the field data. The internal mixing of alkaline components in mineral dust with Fe-containing minerals can lead to higher pH and thus suppression of Fe dissolution (

 </xref>,

  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>). In North African mineral dust aerosols, the ratio of labile Fe to the sum of labile and less labile Fe concentrations indicates a weak degree of Fe processing in aerosols (5.6 ± 2.2% on average from 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E3" class="xref">Eq. 3</xref> in Materials and Methods). By contrast, non–North African air mass has a strong degree of Fe processing in aerosols (36 ± 15% on average). At the same time, the three models (IMPACT, TM4-ECPL, and CAM4) estimate a large contribution of combustion aerosols to the labile aerosol Fe at higher Fe solubility and lower aerosol Fe concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Moreover, IMPACT reproduced the sporadically high Fe solubility observed in aerosols from the other air mass regimes, specifically marine and high-latitude air masses.
