<p class="p">The simulated Fe solubility is further compared with the field data (black symbols) in the equatorial Atlantic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The atmospheric residence time, and thus the time available for atmospheric processing, of North African mineral dust aerosols increases as the dust is transported to the west, but there is no significant trend in Fe solubility for the field data with longitude, around 10°N across the tropical Atlantic (

 </xref>). This low solubility of 2.0 ± 1.5% with no longitudinal trend for aerosol Fe is captured by IMPACT, TM4-ECPL, and GEOS-Chem.
