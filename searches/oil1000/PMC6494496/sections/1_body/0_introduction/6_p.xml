<p class="p">Given the key role of Fe in ocean biogeochemistry (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>) and the importance of atmospheric transport in delivering Fe to the remote oceans, it is critical to develop atmospheric Fe transport models that can realistically simulate total and labile Fe deposition fluxes to the oceans. These models can then provide a tool to consider how Fe deposition fluxes may have changed in the past and/or could change in the future and how anthropogenic perturbations might affect ocean biogeochemistry. Our companion article described four atmospheric Fe models, which participated in the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) intercomparison study, and analyzed the differences in atmospheric concentrations and deposition fluxes between models, as well as between models and observations compiled from multiple field campaigns (
