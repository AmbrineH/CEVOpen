<p class="p">Here, we performed a statistical analysis using the maximum likelihood method to compare Fe solubility between field data and model information (see Materials and Methods). We show better agreement in Fe solubility between model estimates and field data when higher solubility is simulated in pyrogenic Fe than lithogenic Fe for the global ocean and four separate oceanic regions from more to less air polluted conditions. We conclude that high Fe solubility in aerosols is mainly attributed to labile Fe released from pyrogenic Fe oxides. The description of the models and details of the statistical approach are provided in Materials and Methods.</p>
