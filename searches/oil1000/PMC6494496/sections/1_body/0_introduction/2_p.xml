<p class="p">Many factors can potentially affect aerosol Fe solubility near particle source regions and the subsequent enhancement of Fe solubility during atmospheric transport (

 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>). However, there are still large uncertainties regarding the relative importance of different sources of aerosol Fe and the effects of atmospheric processing on the solubility of the Fe delivered to the surface ocean. Furthermore, the experimental method for the determination of labile Fe in aerosols differs among research groups with regard to the leaching techniques used (e.g., batch versus flow-through), the leaching solutions and extraction times, and the analytical techniques (

  <italic class="italic">9</italic>
 </xref>). However, these differences do not appear to be the sole cause of the wide range of reported Fe solubilities (

  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>). Generally, an increase in Fe solubility with a decrease in total aerosol Fe concentration appears to be a robust feature in global aerosol datasets (
