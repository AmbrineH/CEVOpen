<p class="p">Marine primary productivity, nitrogen fixation, and particulate organic matter fluxes in the global open ocean are often controlled by the availability of the micronutrient iron (Fe) (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">1</italic>
 </xref>). Primary productivity is most sensitive to the amount of bioavailable Fe input in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions, such as the sub-Arctic and equatorial Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. Atmospheric Fe-containing particles are important sources of bioavailable Fe to the ocean and can thus affect global climate via their influence on primary productivity (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </xref>). The solubility of Fe in ambient aerosols (i.e., the ratio of labile to total Fe) largely controls the bioavailability of this micronutrient after its deposition to the ocean (

 </xref>). The term “labile” Fe in total Fe is operationally defined as the fraction of aerosol Fe that can be leached from the particulate phase into solution, in line with the widely held assumption that this form of Fe is readily bioavailable and therefore affects marine primary productivity (
