 <xref rid="B6-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The identification by mass fragmentation and retention indices (RI) revealed the presence of 27 components representing 72.4% of the total oil. The components and their relative percentage are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-00460-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The results showed that the major constituents were α-bisabolol (20.2%), valeranone (11.8%), chamazulene (9.9%), spathulenol (8.2%), β-caryophyllene (6.1%), and caryophyllene oxide (5.2%), with oxygenated sesquiterpenes (59.1%) being the main class of compounds, followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (8.7%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (3.9%), using relative quantification by GC-MS.
