<p class="p">NO production was assessed according to the Griess reaction. Dexamethasone (DEX) was selected as a positive control. RAW 264.7 cells were provided by the Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Each tested sample was dissolved in DMSO, and diluted with fresh FBS-free DMEM media to a final concentration with DMSO ≤ 0.02%. The RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded in 96-well plates (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) and co-incubated with samples (concentrations of 4, 20, and 100 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and LPS (10 ng·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>)
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the culture supernatant was mixed with 25 mL Griess reagent with (0.2% 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-(1-naphtyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and 25 μL of 2% sulphanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid solution) to determine NO production. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microtiter plate reader.
