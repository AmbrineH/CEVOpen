 <sub class="sub">2</sub> virus of 30 TCID
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and in a humidified 5% CO

 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> essential oil at different concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and with a positive control drug (ribavirin), respectively, and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atmosphere. The CPE was observed to evaluate the antiviral activity of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> essential oil, and IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> (50% inhibitory concentration) was calculated.
