<p class="p">MDCK cells with a density of 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells per well were seeded into 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h until the cells reached 90% confluency. After incubation, the cells were treated with various concentrations of essential oil (200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) dilutions with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin G (100 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), and streptomycin (100 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), respectively. These dilutions were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 72 h. The cytotoxicity of the essential oil was determined by modified MTT assay, and cell viability was expressed with optical density.
