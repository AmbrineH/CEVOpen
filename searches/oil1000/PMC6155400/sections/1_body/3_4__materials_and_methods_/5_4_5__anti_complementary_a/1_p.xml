<p class="p">Anti-complementary activation was assessed by the classical pathway based on the degree of hemolysis of erythrocytes. The various concentrations of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> were, respectively, dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and then diluted with barbital-buffered saline (BBS) (containing 0.1% gelatin, 0.5 mM Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, 0.15 mM Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, and pH 7.0). The DMSO final concentration was kept less than 1% to avoid interference with the complementary activities detection. Sensitized erythrocytes (EA) were prepared by incubating sheep erythrocytes (4.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cells/mL) with rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody. Various dilutions of tested samples (200 μL) were mixed with 200 μL of diluted guinea pig serum (1:80) and 200 μL EA. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged for 5 min. The optical density of the supernatant (200 μL) was measured at 405 nm with a spectrophotometer.
