<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis of essential oil was carried out on a Thermofocus DSQII (Thermo, Wilmington, DE, USA), equipped with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature was programmed from 60 °C (1 min isothermal) to 300 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min, and then kept for 8 min with a carrier gas at 1.0 mL/min. Both the temperatures of the MS transfer line and the injector were set at 250 °C. One microliter of essential oil sample was injected (in split mode 20:1). The mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV with a mass scan range of 41–400 amu. Compounds of essential oils were identified by matching their mass spectra with data bank mass spectra in NIST5.0 (National Institute of Standards and Technology), and comparing their retention to a homologous series of
