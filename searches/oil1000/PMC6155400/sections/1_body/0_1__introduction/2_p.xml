 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic>. As reported [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], 75–78 volatile compounds and 27 essential oil compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> from Khumbu Valley, Nepal have been determined using HS-SPME GC-MS [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and GC-MS, respectively. However, depending on the method of extraction employed, their major constituents were quite different. The HS-SPME volatiles mainly contained α-pinene (38.87%–48.35%), β-phellandrene (25.86%), and seychellene (7.09%–11.54%) [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], while the essential oil mainly contained spathulenol (24.83%), α-bisabolol (7.80%), 9-tetradecenol (7.65%), thujopsene (6.60%), α-thujone (5.69%), and yomogi alcohol (5.08%) using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences v. 20 software (SPSS, IBM, Segrate, Milan, Italy) for statistical analyses [
