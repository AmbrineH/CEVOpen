<p class="p">The result of GC-MS analysis indicated that α-bisabolol, valeranone, spathulenol, caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide were the major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra.</italic> It is worth noting that some major compounds had been isolated from other plants and reported to have various bioactivities. α-Bisabolol isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Pogostemon speciosus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">Eremanthus erythropappus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], and 
 <italic class="italic">Matricaria chamomilla</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] was considered to have anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities. Valeranone in 
 <italic class="italic">Valeriana officinalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Valeriana wallichii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] were reported for its anti-inflammatory effect. Spathulenol in 
 <italic class="italic">Lantana camara</italic> characterized antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide in 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium pseudochamaepitys</italic> presented antioxidant, cytotoxic, and antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-22-00460" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Therefore, we can infer that the properties of anti-influenza and anti-inflammation of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> may due to these major chemical compounds.
