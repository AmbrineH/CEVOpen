<p class="p">Tibetan medicine has been a hot topic in recent years because of its magical medicine theory, multi-herb compatibility complex system, and various medical effects. Therefore, the analysis of the chemical composition of this Tibetan medicinal herb and its bioactivities are of great importance for Tibetan medicine development. Herein, we firstly reported the in vitro anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory effects of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic>, which were concordant with the plant’s folk medicinal use on cold and fever in people. However, the essential oil did not show the expected anti-complementary activity. It is interesting that the non-volatile extract of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> was found to show potent anti-complementary activity with CH
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> less than 0.1 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the subsequent study, but no anti-influenza activity. It suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> is a very useful resource of Tibetan medicine to treat inflammatory diseases induced especially by the influenza virus, with the essential oil directly killing the influenza virus and the anti-complementary extract inhibiting the excessive activation of the immune system [

The different roles and synergistic effect of these two extracts on influenza virus induced inflammation and fever in vivo are worth investigating and discussing in the near future, as well as the possible mechanism. The major anti-influenza compounds of the essential oil and the anti-complementary constituents of the non-volatile extract will also be investigated.
