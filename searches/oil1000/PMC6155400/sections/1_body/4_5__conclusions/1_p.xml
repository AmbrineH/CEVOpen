<p class="p">In conclusion, the present study is the first to report the essential oil composition and bioactivities of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> from Tibet, China. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> showed anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory effects, but no anti-complementary activity. The essential oil and the non-volatile extract should play different roles on the medical use of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic>. However, the composition of the essential oil 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> from Gangs Rinpoche Mountain (Trans-Himalaya Mountain Range in Tibet) were quite different from the reported 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> sample from Nepal. Thus, further comparison of the bioactivities and active compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">W. glabra</italic> samples from north, south, and trans-Himalaya regions will be of great importance.
