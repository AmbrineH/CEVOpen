<p class="p">Overall, our results indicate a potential utilization of EOs and DEs for the protection of the stored grain in integrated pest management programs and in the organic agriculture chain. Although the insecticidal properties of EOs and DEs are already known, this research showed that by way of a co-treatment it is possible to enhance the efficacy of the two substances, overcoming some of the problems related to the use of substances individually. In particular, the reduced quantity of the EOs and DEs may reduce the DEs side effects for the workers and machinery and the EOs impact on the olfactory characteristics of the grain. To that regard, future trials will be designed to test how the EO plus DEs treatments may affect the final consumers preferences for bread, pasta, and other products prepared with the treated wheat.</p>
