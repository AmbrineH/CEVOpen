<p class="p">Ten unsexed adults of 
 <italic class="italic">S. granarius</italic> (1–3 days old) were introduced into glass jars (300 ml) filled with 150 g of either treated or non-treated (control) maize (15% r.h.). The EO-treated wheat was prepared by mixing the wheat with ethanolic solutions of the EOs in order to obtain a final concentration of 0, 25, 50, and 100 μL∙kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain. The EO plus DEs-treated wheat was prepared by mixing the wheat with a formulation obtained by direct absorption of the EOs onto DEs in 1:1 (w:w) proportion. The final concentrations of the EO plus DEs-treated wheat were 0, 20, 40, and 60 mg∙kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain. The experiments were replicated four times. The sealed jars were kept at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C), 65% relative humidity, in the dark. The number of dead insects in each jar was checked after nine days.
