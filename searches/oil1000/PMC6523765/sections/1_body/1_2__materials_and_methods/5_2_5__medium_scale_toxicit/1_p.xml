<p class="p">A medium-scale toxicity bioassay was set up in at the Cooperativa Maidicola (Sovicille, SI, Italy). Twelve mini-silos containing 250 kg of insect-free wheat grain each were placed in the grain storage plant of the cooperative at the base of the silos. Fifty adults of 
 <italic class="italic">Sitophilus granarius</italic> (Coleoptera Curculionidae), 
 <italic class="italic">Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> (Coleopera Bostrichidae), 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptolestes ferrugineus</italic> (Coleoptera Cucujidae), 
 <italic class="italic">Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Coleoptera Tenebrionidae), and 
 <italic class="italic">Oryzaephilus</italic> spp. (Coleoptera Silvanidae) adults were put in each mini-silo to assure a basal level of infestation. The insects were reared under laboratory conditions (24 °C, 45–65% r.h., and in the dark) at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment of the University of Pisa. Plastic boxes (20 × 27 × 11 cm) containing broken corn and wheat, covered by a nylon net allowing air exchange, were used for the rearing. The wheat in the mini-silos was treated with: 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> EO, DEs, and DEs plus 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> EO (1:1, w:w) formulation to obtain a final concentration of 130 μL∙kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain for the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> and of 130 mg∙ kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain for the DEs and DEs plus 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> EO formulation. To assure a uniform distribution, after the addition of the substances, the grain of each mini-silo was mixed by a mortar mixer (Paint/Mortar Mixer mod. TC-MX 1400 E, Einhell Italia srl, Binago, CO, Italy). Three replicates for each treatment and non-treated wheat as control were performed. The trial was performed from August 2017 to March 2018. The insect infestation of the wheat was checked after 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 240 days, taking 5 wheat samples (in the center and in each of the 4 corners, 10 cm from the edge) from each mini silo (about 500 g of wheat). The samples were collected using a mechanical sampler for cereals (PNS sampler, IROM Italia srl, Brugherio, MB, Italy). The samples were transferred in laboratory and the number of alive insects within each sample was assessed by sieving. Only

 <italic class="italic">T. castaneum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Oryzaephilus</italic> spp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Sitophilus</italic> spp. adults were counted.
