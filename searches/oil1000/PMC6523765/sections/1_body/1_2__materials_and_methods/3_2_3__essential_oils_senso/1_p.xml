 <xref rid="B27-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. All assessors had previous experience in sensory descriptive analysis. The assessors were provided with a specifically developed sensorial sheet consisting of a non-structured, parametric, descriptive scoring chart. The panelists described the main odors characterizing each sample on the basis of defined descriptors in terms of smell “Intensity”, “Persistency”, and “Pleasantness”, as hedonic parameters, and they gave a score for each of them, where the minimum level was 0 and the maximum was 10. The blind smell test was performed in the morning, in a well-ventilated quiet room and in a relaxed atmosphere. Each panelist was provided with a 2 × 2 cm filter paper soaked with 50 μL of an unknown EO and with a clean 100 mL glass beaker containing 100 g of wheat grain treated with an unknown EO. To avoid cross contamination, the six samples were assessed separately in the same morning (15 min waiting between two assessing).
