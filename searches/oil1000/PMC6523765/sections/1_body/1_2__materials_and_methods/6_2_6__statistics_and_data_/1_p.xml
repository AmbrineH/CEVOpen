<p class="p">Data of the assessments of the smell profiles of EOs were processed by one-way ANOVA with the EO treatment as factor. When needed, data were normalized by arcsine transformation. Averages were separated by Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparison test (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated by Log-probit regression. LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were then pairwise compared by relative median potency (RMP) analysis. The synergistic effects between EOs and DEs was evaluated by co-toxicity coefficient (CTC) according to Sun and Johnson [
