<p class="p">In our experiments we observed a synergistic effect on the toxicity of DEs and all the tested EOs when administrated together. In particular, such synergistic effect was very marked for 
 <italic class="italic">F. vulgare</italic> EO, that showed the lowest efficacy among the three EOs tested when administered alone, but the highest efficacy when applied together with Des, with an increase of the toxicity of about three times. A similar synergistic effect between EOs and other bioactive substances has been previously observed for EOs and pyrethroids, as described for the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">Elettaria cardamomum</italic> and the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin [
