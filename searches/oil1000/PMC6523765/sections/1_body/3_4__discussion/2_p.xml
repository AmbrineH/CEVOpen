<p class="p">The description of the main sensory attributes associated to the three EOs was consistent with their chemical composition as detected by GC-MS. In particular, the odor expression of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> can be well explained by the presence of methyl chavicol (sweet, phenolic, anise, harsh, spice, green, herbal, minty) and 1,8-cineole (eucalyptus, herbal, camphor, medicinal, with cooling effect) [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Besides, the smell expression of 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> is well represented by the odor character generally attributed to α-pinene (woody, piney and turpentine-like, with a slight cooling camphoraceous nuance and a fresh herbal lift), β-pinene (cooling, woody, piney and turpentine-like with a fresh minty, eucalyptus, and camphoraceous note with a spicy peppery and nutmeg nuance), Myrcene (terpy, herbaceous, woody with a rosy celery and carrot nuances), and β-caryophyllene (sweet, woody, spice, clove, dry nuances). Furthermore, the off-flavor specifically attributed to 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> can be due to the presence of o-methyl anisole (naphthyl, camphoraceous, phenolic, and woody with a salicylate nuance), α-campholenal (herbal, green, woody nuances) together with camphene (camphoraceous, cooling, piney woods with terpy nuances). Finally, (E)-anethole, together with anisic ketone and limonene can be assumed as the chemical compounds that characterize, specifically, the odor of 
 <italic class="italic">F. vulgare</italic>, as they were not detected in the volatile fraction of the other two EOs tested. Their presence perfectly justifies the description of the smell provided by judges during panel test of 
 <italic class="italic">F. vulgare</italic>, as their odor expression can be described by referring to: sweet, anise, licorice, and mimosa for (E)-anethole; citrus, orange, fresh, sweet for limonene; and sweet, fruity spicy, with anise balsamic nuances for anisic ketone.
