<p class="p">In this work, because of its high insecticidal activity coupled with its good sensory quality, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> was found to be the most suitable for treatment of the grain as protectant against insect pest. However, when tested in the mini silos, the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> alone resulted as the treatment with the highest mean presence of insects, while the grain co-treated with DEs and 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> EO showed the lowest mean insect presence during the experiment. Contrary to what was observed in the laboratory, the inefficacy of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> in the grain storage plant could be due to the dilution of EO vapors in the air, to doses that might have been attractive to the insects. Plant volatiles play an essential role in communication between host plants and herbivorous insects [

 <xref rid="B43-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The differential volatilization of the different compound of the EO may have resulted in an attractive effect on the local insect population. A similar insect attraction to 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> EO was observed by Górski [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] in greenhouses experiment for the trapping of 
 <italic class="italic">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</italic> (Homoptera Aleyrodidae). On the contrary, the enhanced toxicity of the same EO when combined with the DEs could be due to a gradual release, and; therefore, higher persistence of EO volatiles when adsorbed onto the surface of the DEs particles. In line with our observations, previous studies indicated that a co-treatment with EO and DEs have a more pronounced persistence of the insecticidal activity of the two substances administrated alone [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The observed enhancement of the effectivity and persistence of the insecticidal activity of the EOs when administrated together with the DEs may be due to the small particles that constitute the Des, whose large surface area may improve the EOs retention. In fact, Ziaee and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] observed that such synergistic effect occurs mainly when DEs have particle size smaller than 37 μm. In addition, according to Athanassiou et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] an increased mobility of the insects increases the possibility of picking up dust particles. Similarly, the EO may have enhanced the locomotion of the insects [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] in the mass of the treated grain, thus the abrasion of their protective wax layer by the DEs [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] with consequent lethal insect dehydration [
