However, despite their efficacy and low toxicity, EOs application in practice is still limited because of their high volatility, composition variability, and strong smell. In fact, EOs olfactory traits may interfere with the sensory characteristics of the treated foodstuff, resulting in products that are not appealing to the consumers [
