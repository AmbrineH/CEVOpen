<p class="p">Interestingly, it has been observed that DEs efficacy against insect pests can be enhanced by co-administration with plant extracts and EOs [

 <xref rid="B17-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,

 <xref rid="B19-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], thus allowing the reduction of DEs doses to be applied to the stored products [

 <xref rid="B20-insects-10-00114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we firstly evaluated the sensory quality of the EOs extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. (Apiaceae), 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. (Lamiaceae), and 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia lentiscus</italic> L. (Anacardiaceae). Then, we determined the toxicity of the three EOs alone and in combination with DEs against the weevil 
 <italic class="italic">Sitophilus granarius</italic> (L.) (Coleoptera Curculionidae), in laboratory conditions and, finally, the EO that showed the best combination of smell profile and toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. granarius</italic> was evaluated alone and in combination with DEs in a medium-size experiment for the control of grain insect pests under real storage conditions.
