<p class="p">All the tested EOs showed a clear insecticidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. granarius</italic> adults. According to the median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of EOs, calculated by probit regression, 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> exhibited the highest efficacy (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 36.36 μL∙kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain) against 
 <italic class="italic">S. granarius</italic> among the three tested EOs, while the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">F. vulgare</italic> had the lowest toxicity (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 77.59 μL∙kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain). The comparison of the toxicity values by RMP analysis indicated that the differences of effectiveness among the three EOs were statistically significant. (
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum vs. P. lentiscus</italic> RMP = 3.58 (2.32–6.09); 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum vs. F. vulgare</italic> RMP = 0.57 (0.40–0.77); 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus vs. F. vulgare</italic> RMP = 0.16 (0.08–0.27)). When the EOs were assayed in combination with DEs, the three EOs efficacy increased substantially, showing synergistic effects (CTC &gt; 1). In particular, the strongest synergistic effect was observed in the 
 <italic class="italic">F. vulgare</italic> plus DEs treatment (CTC = 3.35). When administered in combination, the highest toxicity was observed for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> plus DEs formulation (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 24.79 mg∙kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain), while the lowest was for the 
 <italic class="italic">F. vulgare</italic> plus DEs formulation (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 23.18 mg∙kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> grain) (

 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> + DEs 
 <italic class="italic">vs. P. lentiscus</italic> + DEs RMP = 1.22 (0.89–1.69);
