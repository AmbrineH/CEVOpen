 <p class="p">Financial support was provided by the project “Trophic assessment of ecosystem services provided by carabid beetles in agricultural land” financed by the Austrian Science Fund FWF (P28578‐B25). For their valuable assistance in animal keeping and the feeding experiments, we thank Matthias Labeck, Markus Neurauter, Michelle Gruber, and Marcel Schön, participating 2014 and 2015 in the program “Young Talents—Internships for Students” financed by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG. Victoria Hoffman contributed significantly to the screening of the samples from the mixed‐diet experiment during her Erasmus stay in Austria.</p>
