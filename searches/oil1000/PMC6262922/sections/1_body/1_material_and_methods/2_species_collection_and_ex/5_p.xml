<p class="p">For the mixed‐diet experiments, the same general procedure was applied as above. Here, two different seed species were selected as a “starter”: 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa‐pastoris, L. perenne,</italic> and afterward one third of a freshly cut mealworm was offered as a “main course.” As carabid beetles did not eat any seeds after having fed on animal prey as a “starter” (personal observation), we refrained from testing the food sequence the other way round. To avoid potential detection of plant DNA present in the herbivorous 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> larvae in the carabid regurgitates, mealworms had been starved for 7 days prior freeze killing them for the experiment. Again, beetles were put individually into the feeding tubes and allowed to feed for 2 hr on 5 seeds of either 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa‐pastoris</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne</italic> in the dark climate cabinet. Beetles that had consumed at least half of a seed were put individually in fresh beakers and allowed to digest for one (i.e., short between seed and mealworm consumption) and eight hours (long), respectively. Thereafter, they were supplied with one third of a 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> larva, which was removed after another hour and beetles were put in clean beakers in the climate cabinet until regurgitation. Beetles were stimulated to regurgitate in batches of 10–14 individuals at different time points (0–128 hr) post‐feeding of the mealworm (Supporting Information Table
