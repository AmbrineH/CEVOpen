<p class="p">For the seed‐identity experiment, fresh feeding containers (60 × 35 mm, h × Ø) were prepared with a drop of water and five seeds of a single plant species each. The beetles were put individually into the feeding tubes and allowed to feed for 2 hr in the dark climate cabinet. Afterward, carabids that had consumed at least half a seed were put individually in clean beakers and kept in the climate cabinet until regurgitation without any further food provided. Beetles were stimulated to regurgitate in batches of 10–15 individuals as described in Wallinger et al. (
