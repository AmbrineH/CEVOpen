<p class="p">In many plant species, what is regularly referred to as the “seed” is actually an achene, a fruit containing a single seed which does not open at maturity, as it is for 
 <italic class="italic">Taraxacum officinale</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Senecio vulgaris</italic>. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Lolium perenne,</italic> the grain resembles an achene, except that it is a caryopsis with a seed coat fused to the seed wall. For reasons of simplicity, we will refer to both the achene and the caryopsis as seeds in the text hereafter. For the experiments to test the impact of seed identity, seeds of six plant species were chosen as experimental food: 
 <italic class="italic">Capsella bursa‐pastoris, Lolium perenne, Rumex obtusifolius, Senecio vulgaris</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Taraxacum officinale,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Trifolium repens</italic>. These plant species are common weeds in Central European arable land and are known to be eaten by 
 <italic class="italic">P. rufipes</italic> (Lundgren, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The seeds of these plants vary significantly in their mass and nutrient composition. For example, the mass of the heaviest seeds (
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne</italic>) was 22 times higher than of the lightest seed (
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa‐pastoris</italic>) and the oil content ranged from 1.8% (
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne</italic>) to 32.7% (
 <italic class="italic">S. vulgaris,</italic> Table
