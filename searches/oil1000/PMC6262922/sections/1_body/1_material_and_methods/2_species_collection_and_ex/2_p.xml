<p class="p">Adult beetles of 
 <italic class="italic">P. rufipes</italic> were trapped on arable land near Innsbruck (760 m a.s.l.; Tyrol, Austria) in two successive summers (August 2014 and 2015). The beetles were kept individually in a climate cabinet (L:D 14:10 hr at 22 and 12°C, respectively) in plastic beakers (71 × 58 mm, h × Ø, screw top lid), containing a piece of moistened tissue. Beakers were ventilated and the tissues replaced every second day. The beetles were maintained on a diet of 1/3 piece of mealworms (
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor L</italic>.), which was offered every fifth day. Prior to the feeding experiments, beetles were starved for five days.
