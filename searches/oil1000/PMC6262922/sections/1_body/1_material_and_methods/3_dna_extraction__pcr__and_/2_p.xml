<p class="p">For lysis, regurgitates were mixed with 200 µl 1×TES buffer 5 µl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and approx. 1 mg PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone) and incubated for 3 hr at 58°C. DNA was thereafter extracted with the BioSprint 96 DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on a Biosprint
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 96 extraction robotic platform (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instruction, with the exception of the lysis step described above and DNA elution in 200 µl 1× TE buffer. DNA extracts were stored at −28°C. All extractions were conducted in a separate pre‐PCR laboratory using a UVC‐equipped laminar flow hood, and two extraction‐negative controls (PCR‐grade water instead of seeds or regurgitate) were included in each batch of 48 samples to check for cross‐sample contamination during the extraction process. None was detected by testing the controls using the diagnostic assays described below.
