<p class="p">For the mixed‐diet experiments, DNA extracts were tested twice: once for seed DNA with the same primer combination and PCR conditions as in the seed‐identity experiment (described above) and once with the mealworm‐specific primers Ten‐mol‐S210 and Ten‐mol‐A212, amplifying a 128‐bp fragment (Oehm, Juen, Nagiller, Neuhauser, &amp; Traugott, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). For the mealworm detection, the 15 µl reactions included 4 µl DNA extract, 7.5 µl 2× Type‐it MutationTM Detect PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 0.5 µl 5× Q‐Solution (Qiagen), 0.5 µg bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4 mM MgCl2, and 0.75 µl of each primer. The cycling protocol included 5 min at 95°C, 35 cycles of 20 s at 92°C, 30 s at 60°C, 30 s at 70°C, and a final elongation of 5 min at 70°C. Within each PCR, one negative control (molecular grade water instead of template DNA) and one positive control (seed/mealworm DNA) was run to check for DNA carryover contamination and amplification success, respectively. All PCR products were visualized using QIAxcel, an automated capillary electrophoresis system (Qiagen), with method AL320, and the results were scored with QIAxcel BioCalculator Fast Analysis Software version 3.0 (Qiagen). Samples showing the expected fragment length with a signal strength exceeding 0.1 relative fluorescent units were deemed to be positive. The DNA extracts of the regurgitates that tested negative in a first run were re‐tested in a second PCR, running the original DNA template to increase the chances of amplification in samples containing only minute quantities of food DNA (Sint, Raso, Kaufmann, &amp; Traugott,
