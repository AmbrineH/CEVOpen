<p class="p">To analyze how time, seed species‐specific traits, and consumed biomass influence the detection success, a discriminant analysis was performed with “digestion time,” “1,000 seed mass,” “oil content,” “protein content,” and “meal size” (i.e., number of consumed seeds × average seed mass obtained from the 1,000 seed mass), as predictive variables. All calculations were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).</p>
