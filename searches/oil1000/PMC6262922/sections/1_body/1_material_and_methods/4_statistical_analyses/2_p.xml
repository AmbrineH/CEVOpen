<p class="p">An ANOVA with Bonferroni‐corrected post hoc tests was performed to analyze differences in the mean number of consumed seeds between the six seed species. Overall plant DNA detection success was tested for significant differences between seed species, using generalized linear models (GLM, LOGIT link function including digestion time (= time post‐feeding) and the interaction between seed species and time as explanatory factors). Pairwise post hoc comparisons (Wald statistics) of estimated marginal means were performed with digestion time fixed at 0 hr and sequential Bonferroni correction. For the mixed‐diet experiment, the influence of the two seed species, the length of the meal break (long vs. short), digestion time, and the interaction between seed species and time on the detection of food DNA (seed and mealworm DNA, respectively) were analyzed using GLMs. Other interaction terms were removed from the models based on nonsignificant effects and informed by Akaike's information criterion corrected for finite samples (AICC). For comparisons of estimated marginal means, digestion time was fixed at 0 hr.</p>
