<p class="p">The eigenvalue of the discriminant analysis to investigate the influence of meal size and seed‐specific traits on the detection probability of seed DNA was 0.229, which is rather low. However, based on the analysis, a total of 73.5% of the regurgitates (302 out of 411 samples) were correctly classified as either “plant DNA detectable” or not (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34536-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). While 81.1% of the positive detections were correctly classified by the discriminant analysis (77 out of 95), the classification success for negative detections was only 71.2% (225 out of 316). The cross‐validation showed a very small dependency on individual samples, with just two more false‐positive classifications. The group centroids of the calculated discriminant scores were −0.87 for positive and 0.262 for negative detections of plant DNA. This small difference also led to a significant overlap of the discriminant scores of the two groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34536-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), resulting in approx. 26.5% misclassified cases (i.e., false negatives and false positives taken together, also see above). The standardized canonical discriminant function coefficients (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34536-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) indicate that “time post‐feeding” and “1,000 seed mass” had the strongest predictive power on the detectability of plant DNA. Those two factors as well as “protein content” were correlated with a negative detection. “Meal size” and “oil content,” in contrast, were correlated with a positive plant DNA detection.
