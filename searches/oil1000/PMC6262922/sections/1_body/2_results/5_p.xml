<p class="p">Due to the setup of the mixed‐diet experiment (meal break between seed and mealworm consumption), the digestion times for the DNA of consumed seeds are longer than for the mealworm for each time point post‐feeding (i.e., by 1 and 8 hr, respectively). For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to the digestion times in relation to the last meal (i.e., mealworm) in the text hereafter. However, the actual digestion time for the respective meal type (seed and mealworm, respectively) was included in the GLMs and for both models the same main effects (seed species, time, meal break) and interaction term (seed species*time) were considered in the final model based on significance of effects and informed by AICC. In the mixed‐diet experiment, both mealworm and seed DNA, of either 
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa‐pastoris,</italic> could be detected for up to 128 hr post‐feeding. In general, detection rates of animal prey were higher than the ones of seeds (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34536-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Detectability of plant DNA in the mixed‐diet experiment was considerably higher for a given time point post‐feeding than in the seed‐identity experiment, where carabids had consumed seeds only. In the mixed‐diet experiment, the detectability was 100% at 0 hr post‐feeding for both seed species (including a feeding interval of 1 hr between seed and mealworm) compared to 90 and only 30% for 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa‐pastoris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne</italic> in a pure seed diet. The GLM indicated a highly significant influence of the “length of the meal break” (1 hr vs. 8 hr; Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 15.328, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and time (Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 8.618, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003) on the detection probability of seed DNA. While the seed species, in this case 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa‐pastoris</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne,</italic> had no significant influence on the outcome (Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.946, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.331), the interaction between “seed species” and time was significant (Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 6.325, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.012). Not only the detection rates of the seeds were influenced by the mixed diet, but also the probability of mealworm detection changed. For seed detection, the “length of the meal break” (Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 5.136, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.023), time (Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 65.360, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the interaction between “seed species” and time (Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 4.522, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.033) had a significant influence on mealworm detection, but not the seed species per se (Wald χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 3.368, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.066). The odds ratios revealed an interesting effect of the meal break on the detection probability of the two food types. While the odds for seed DNA detectability were higher with the short, 1 hr meal break compared to the long one, the opposite was true for mealworm DNA (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34536-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Comparisons of the estimated marginal means, however, showed only a significant difference in the detection probability depending on the “length of the meal break” for seed DNA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) but not for mealworm DNA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.054) or differences between the seed species (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">seed</sub> = 0.328, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">mealworm</sub> = 0.089).
