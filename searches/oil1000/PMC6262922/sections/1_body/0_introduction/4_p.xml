<p class="p">DNA‐based diet analysis has become a widely used approach for the identification of trophic interactions under natural conditions (Pompanon et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, apart from a few exceptions (Lundgren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Lundgren, Ellsbury, &amp; Prischmann, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Wallinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), granivorous carabids have received little attention in this field. The consumption, digestion, and thus detectability of seeds might be essentially different compared to other plant tissue or animal prey. Earlier experiments in this field showed promising results, where seed DNA had been traced in the regurgitates of carabids for at least 3 days post‐feeding (Wallinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), an even longer detection period than previously thought. Among the variety of molecular approaches, next‐generation sequencing (NGS) enables many consumed species to be detected simultaneously via DNA metabarcoding. To date, numerous NGS studies of herbivory have employed general plant primers targeting the 
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>L‐region (Pompanon et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Soininen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Continual improvement, ongoing decreases in costs, and current expansion of reference databases make species identification based on the 
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>L‐region a promising approach, also in respect to the detection of trophic links between carabids and specific seed species in arable fields. The present feeding experiments were initiated in view of such field investigations, as differences in the detectability of varying seed species may occur if targeted with general plant primers (Wallinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). So far, we have a poor understanding of how seed characteristics (i.e., species identity, chemical composition) or the meal size affect post‐feeding seed DNA detection intervals via general plant primers in carabid beetles. As such, we have employed general plant primers targeting the 
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>L region for investigating the detectability of different consumed seed species.
