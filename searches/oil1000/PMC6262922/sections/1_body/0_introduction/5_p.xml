<p class="p">Given that the vast majority of carabids is omnivorous and consumes a wide range of food (Lövei &amp; Sunderland, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>), they may eat both seeds and insect prey at the same time. Dietary mixing of different animal prey showed contradictory influences on the molecular detectability of food in arthropods (Lövei, Sopp, &amp; Sunderland, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref> ; Weber &amp; Lundgren, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, currently there is still no information available on how the DNA detectability of a specific seed is influenced by a mixed diet in carabids, although this information would be highly relevant for the interpretation of field derived molecular trophic data of omnivorous arthropods.
