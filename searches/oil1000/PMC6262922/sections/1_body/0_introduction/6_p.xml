<p class="p">The aims of the present study were to identify (a) the maximum detection time during which seed consumption can be traced molecularly in carabid regurgitates by the example of 
 <italic class="italic">P. rufipes</italic>, (b) the impact of seed species identity, seed chemical composition, and meal size on post‐feeding plant DNA detection, and (c) the influence of a mixed diet on the detectability of both consumed seeds and mealworm. To investigate these issues, we established a set of feeding experiments, offering seeds of six different weed species, and a mixed diet to carabids and compared the seed DNA detection success in regurgitates with general plant primers targeting the 
 <italic class="italic">trn</italic>L exon (chloroplast DNA), and species‐specific primers targeting the COI gene (mitochondrial DNA) for the animal prey.
