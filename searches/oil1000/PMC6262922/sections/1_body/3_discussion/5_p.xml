<p class="p">The subsequent feeding of a mealworm after seed consumption led to an increased detectability of seed DNA in the regurgitates and an extension of the detection time post‐feeding compared to a diet exclusively on seeds: initial detections rates of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa‐pastoris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. perenne</italic> at 0 hr post‐feeding were higher and the decrease in detectability was attenuated, especially when the seed and insect food were consumed immediately (1 hr) one after the other. This effect was less pronounced at an extended meal break of 8 hr between seed and mealworm consumption. According to the optimal digestion theory, a meal is expected to disappear faster with access to food following it, than after the target meal only, with no subsequent opportunity to feed (Penry &amp; Juman, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>). This effect was confirmed in an experiment conducted by Weber and Lundgren (
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) who were able to detect DNA of the Colorado potato beetle over a longer time span if the predator was not allowed to feed on other prey thereafter. One might thus expect shorter retention times in the guts, resulting from physical effects of the first meal being displaced by subsequent food. Earlier studies on the influence of dietary mixing of different animal prey types, however, have shown varying influences on the detectability of the target prey, ranging from positive (Fournier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Harper et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), to none (Lövei, Sopp, &amp; Sunderland, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref> ), to negative (Weber &amp; Lundgren, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In the current experiment, we found a clear positive effect of subsequent mealworm consumption on the post‐feeding detection of seed DNA. At the same time, the presence of seed DNA did not seem to have strong effects on the detection of the animal prey when comparing them with other feeding experiments with 
 <italic class="italic">P. rufipes</italic> (Waldner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) or employing the same mealworm primers as we did (Sint et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), although the detectability of the mealworm DNA in the present experiment was slightly higher when the meal break between seed and animal prey was longer. Altogether, this indicates that plant and animal food can be detected over a considerable period of time post‐consumption in omnivorous carabids. That is highly relevant also in field‐caught beetles, where it remains unclear whether they consumed only one prey type or several ones and how long ago the feeding has happened. This potentially opens the possibility to investigate the full dietary spectrum of omnivorous carabid beetles under field conditions with molecular methods, delivering important insight into their feeding behavior and consequently increase the knowledge on their provision of ecosystem services.
