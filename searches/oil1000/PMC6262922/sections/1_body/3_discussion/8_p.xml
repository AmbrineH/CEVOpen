<p class="p">In conclusion, the present data show that with this noninvasive approach, carabid consumption of various seed species can be molecularly detected for at least five days post‐feeding under laboratory conditions. Although detection times may vary under field conditions, this novel approach provides an opportunity to detect seed‐feeding and integrate this knowledge into food web ecology for carabid beetles. Our findings indicate that plant identity, chemical composition, and meal size can affect DNA detection of consumed seeds. The results from the mixed‐feeding experiment suggest that the omnivorous feeding mode of carabids may lead to prolonged detection intervals of consumed seeds, thus enlarging the potential time window for successful food detection compared to what has been previously assumed. The species‐specific differences observed seem to play a minor role in a mixed diet, which is natural for many carabid species. On the basis of broad tolerance margins and a high sample number, good estimates of trophic interactions between carabids and their seed prey can be drawn. Altogether, this novel approach represents a promising opportunity to identify seed‐feeding species and integrate this knowledge into food web ecology for carabid beetles. It will enable us to investigate the overall potential of carabid beetles as weed biocontrol agents in arable land. Apart from identifying carabid key species, it will be possible to evaluate the success of facilitation measurements in respect to a robust and resilient provision of this ecosystem service, therefore significantly contributing to international goals in reducing pesticide applications without compromising crop yield.</p>
