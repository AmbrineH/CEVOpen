<p class="p">In general, the recovery of food DNA has been shown to be affected by numerous variables (King, Read, Traugott, &amp; Symondson, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and the observed differences might be ascribed to biological reasons or introduced via the methodological approach (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Potential methodological biases are, for example, different efficiencies due to varying primer binding sites (Sipos et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) or differences in the length of the amplified fragment (Sint et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Waldner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). They can be minimized by a prudent study design including an appropriate assay selection. For example, in the present case, binding sites as well as expected fragment length had been the same for all seed species. On the other hand, biases due to biological factors influencing food DNA detectability are rooted in variation inherent to the system. Primarily, they can be ascribed either to differences in target DNA density in the consumed tissue (Deagle &amp; Tollit, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) or in prey DNA survival during digestion. Especially prey DNA survival depends on many factors such as temperature (Hosseini, Schmidt, &amp; Keller, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), additional prey consumed (Penry &amp; Juman, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>), or prey identity, as described above. In case of the latter, the use of correction factors, evaluated by measuring species‐specific DNA recovery rates, is suggested to improve the estimates (Greenstone et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, developing such correction factors is not always that straightforward. In the present case, it would require multiple extensive, time‐consuming feeding trials including every single species that carabids potentially might prey on, or at least an extensive, representative selection to potentially identify certain seed traits as robust predictors. And even if we can generate such correction factors, still not all biases are feasible to mitigate for every potential food source in combination with the multiple factors such as meal size, mixed feeding, and many more. When it comes to the molecular identification of specific taxa to unravel trophic interactions in the field, in some cases a diagnostic approach via species‐specific primers may thus represent an advisable alternative to NGS and the use of general primers, provided that the primers are balanced in their sensitivity and the potential food sources are restricted to a certain number of known seed species. However, even when many consumed species of an unknown prey spectrum make DNA metabarcoding and accordingly the use of general primer necessary, the identification of seed DNA can clearly provide informative data, as for example correctly identifying frequently consumed seed species. This applied all the more since the differences in DNA detection observed in the seed‐only experiment were no longer evident in the mixed‐feeding setup, indicating that the seed type will likely play a minor role in field‐caught carabids. Moreover, food DNA can still be detected when present at low levels so that the unequal digestion of DNA from different prey species will not necessarily translate into significant biases in a semiquantitative approach based on presence/absence data (Deagle &amp; Tollit, 
 <xref rid="ece34536-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Therefore, the identification of food DNA in regurgitates seems appropriate for determining the carabid diet composition in the field. In this context, we recommend high numbers of replicates.
