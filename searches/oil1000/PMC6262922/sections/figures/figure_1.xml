  <p class="p">Detectability of seed DNA in regurgitates of 
   <italic class="italic">Pseudoophonus rufipes</italic> fed with seeds of six different seed species at different time points post‐feeding ranging from 0 to 128 hr post‐feeding. A minimum of 10 regurgitates per time point post‐feeding was tested with general plant primers. Observed detection rates are provided for the different time points as circles along with fitted LOGIT models for the decrease in seed DNA detection success including the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals (thin lines) and the time points where the detection probability equals 50% (dashed lines)
