 <p> Detectability of seed and mealworm DNA in regurgitates of Pseudoophonus rufipes in a pure and mixed‐diet feeding scenario at different time points post‐feeding ranging from 0 to 128 hr after the consumption of their last meal (i.e., mealworm). Carabids were fed with seeds of either Capsella bursa‐pastoris (upper panel) or Lolium perenne (lower panel) first and then with mealworm—with a meal break of 1 and 8 hr (green for seeds, blue for mealworms), respectively. A minimum of 10 regurgitates per time point post‐feeding was tested with general plant primers and species‐specific ones for mealworm DNA. Observed detection rates are provided for the different time points for seeds as black circles (1 hr meal break) and green triangles (8 hr) and for mealworm as black squares (1 hr) and blue triangles (8 hr) along with fitted LOGIT models for the decrease in seed DNA detection success including the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals (thin lines) </p>
