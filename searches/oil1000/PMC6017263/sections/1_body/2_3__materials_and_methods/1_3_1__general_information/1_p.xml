<p class="p">The NMR spectra were run on a Varian (Walnut Creek, CA, USA, 400 MHz for 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 100 MHz for 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) in CDCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Chemical shifts were reported in δ (ppm), relative to the signal of tetramethylsilane (TMS) and coupling constants (
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>) in Hz. The GC-MS analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies (Wilmington, DE, USA) 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer detector Agilent Technologies 5973N. For both GC-MS and GC-FID analyses, the instrument was equipped with a DB5-MS Agilent 122-5532 column (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm thickness of the stationary phase 0.25 µm). Silica gel 60 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, from 0.063 to 0.200 mm) and RP-18 (Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, 40–63 µm) were used as stationary phases for column chromatography. Normal phase Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), with fluorescence indicator at 254 nm, were purchased by Sigma-Aldrich. After exposure to UV light (254 and 366 nm), the plates were revealed with a mixture of sulphuric acid and vanillin. All organic solvents were bought in Brenntag (Brengtan, Guayaquil, Ecuador) and re-distilled before using. Optical rotations were acquired in an Automatic Polarimeter (Jinan Hanon Instruments Co. Ltd., Jinan, China) MRC P810. Refractive indices were measured with a digital ABBE refractometer (Boeco, Hamburg, Germany).
