 <italic class="italic">C. taxifolium</italic> (500 g) were ground to powder. The ground material was exhaustively submitted to solvent extraction by maceration at room temperature, by increasing solvent polarity during a 3 days process. Hexane (Hex), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and methanol (MeOH) were used in this order. After solvent removal at reduced pressure, three dry extracts were obtained: hexanic extract (3.61 g) with a yield of 0.62% on dry material, ethyl acetate (25.79 g) with a yield of 5.16% and methanol (34.63 g) with a yield of 6.93%. Column chromatography was performed on 3 g of hexane extract. Silica gel (300 g) was packed in a column (50 mm Ã— 800 mm) as stationary phase and it was eluted with a mixture of n-hexane/EtOAc (325 fractions of 25 mL each), according to an increasing gradient of eluotropic strength (from 10:90 to 0:100). The fractions were pooled according to TLC profiles (normal phase TLC, eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc according to metabolite polarity). A fraction, denominated AR002/5 (597.7 mg), was submitted to further fractionations on normal phase, with different isocratic mixtures of n-hexane/EtOAc and CH
