<p class="p">The most polar fraction of the same extract (18 mg) was successively chromatographed on silica gel (2 g in a column of 10 mm Ã— 100 mm), eluted with a mixture of n-hexane/EtOAc (40 fractions of 1 mL each). The elution was performed according to increasing polarity with a mixture of n-hexane:EtOAc (from 90:10 to 70:30), obtaining two main fractions. One of these (5 mg) afforded the triterpene ursolic acid (
