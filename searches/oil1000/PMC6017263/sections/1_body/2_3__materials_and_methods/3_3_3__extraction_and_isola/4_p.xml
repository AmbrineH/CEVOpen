<p class="p">The methanol extract (5 g) was submitted to a process for removing chlorophyll by partition between MeOH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (90:10) and hexane, repeated for three times. After evaporation of the polar phase, 1 g of the residue was fractionated by CC over silica gel (100 g in a column of 30 mm × 400 mm), eluting according to a polarity gradient of EtOAc/MeOH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (from 150:15:5 to 50:15:5). The process afforded 100 fractions of 10 mL each. The fractions were pooled according to TLC profiles (normal phase TLC, eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc according to metabolite polarity). Further purification of a fraction (108 mg) on CC (11 g of silica gel in a column of 20 mm × 200 mm), with n-hexane/EtOAc (from 80:20 to 40:60), yielded the flavonoid salvigenin (
