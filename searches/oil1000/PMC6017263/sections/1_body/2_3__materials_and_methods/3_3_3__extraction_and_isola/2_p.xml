<p class="p">The EtOAc extract (2 g) was submitted to normal phase CC (150 g of silica). The stationary phase was packed in a column (50 mm Ã— 400 mm) that was eluted with a mixture of n-hexane/EtOAc (230 fractions of 15 mL each), according to increasing polarity gradient (from 90:10 to 0:100). Finally, the column was washed down with pure MeOH. The fractions were combined according to their TLC patterns (normal phase TLC, eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc according to metabolite polarity). A subsequent gradient fractionation of an 18 mg fraction, performed with n-hexane/EtOAc, afforded two metabolites. The first one (8 mg) was a mixture of two triterpenes: uvaol (
