 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (1:1). Dilutions in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) were made in case of getting complete enzyme inhibition. First, 75 μL of PBS (SIGMA-P4417) were mixed with 5 μL of the sample and 20 μL of the enzyme solution (SIGMA G5003, 0.15 U/mL in PBS pH 7.4). Then, it was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the initiation of the reaction by adding the substrate. After pre-incubation, 20 μL of PNPG (5 mM in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was added and then incubated at 37 °C. The amount of p-NP released was measured in an EPOCH 2 (BIOTEK
