<p class="p">Whereas the quantitative composition of almost all the constituents of the essential oil were quite constant in both collection years, the oxygenated sesquiterpenes were quite variable, varying about between 24% in 2015 and 8% in 2016. Despite the collection being performed both times during the same months, a climatic factor is not the most probable cause of the variation, as the samples were obtained from the same spots. This variability is quite interesting, as the amount of the oxygenated sesquiterpenic fraction is sometimes related to the value of an essential oil. Elemol and agarospirol are the most variable oxygenated sesquiterpenes, with the first one changing from about 9% in 2015 to less than 5% in 2016, and the second one from 8% in 2015 to traces in 2016. According to recent literature [

Despite the fact that this phenomenon cannot be demonstrated in the present work, it seems to be a possible ecologic hypothesis for future studies. The qualitative and quantitative chemical composition of the essential oil is presented in
