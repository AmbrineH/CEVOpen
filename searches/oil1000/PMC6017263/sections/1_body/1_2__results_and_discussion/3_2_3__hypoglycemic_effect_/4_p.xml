<p class="p">According to [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-00146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], MIC values ranging between 100 to 500 µg/mL have a moderate activity and MIC values higher than this are considered weak or inactive, so, only the hexanic extract exhibited moderate inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00146-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Up to date, there is no research about the biological properties of 
 <italic class="italic">Clinopodium taxifolium</italic>. Unfortunately, the antibacterial effect of the compounds was not tested in this work, due to the low yield obtained and also because the four compounds were mainly tested for hypoglycemic effect. However, according to literature, UA has a good profile of antibacterial activities showing good inhibition against 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Shigella flexneri</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with MIC values below than 100 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-00146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Besides, UA exerted synergistic effects by combining it with neomycin, amikacin, kanamycin and gentamicin, showing a broad spectrum of synergistic activity (MIC values 8 to 32 times higher than antibiotic alone) against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">K. penumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. flexneri</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V. choleare</italic>. Also, UA showed good inhibition activity against 
 <italic class="italic">M. tuberculosis</italic> with a MIC value ranging from 10 to 20 µg/mL, measured by colorimetric resazurin assay [
