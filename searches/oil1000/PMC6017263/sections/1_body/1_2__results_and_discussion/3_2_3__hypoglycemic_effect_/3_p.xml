 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-00146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], UA promotes glucose uptake in HepG2 cells and reduced the blood glucose levels of diabetic mice to a different extent even preventing the body weight loss caused by the induction with STZ. Besides, the a α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of UA was 510 µg/mL (1116.7 µM), fourteen times less effective compared to the value obtained in this study, which can be attributed to the short time of incubation (10 min), compared to our method that measures the inhibitory effect over a lapse of sixty minutes.
