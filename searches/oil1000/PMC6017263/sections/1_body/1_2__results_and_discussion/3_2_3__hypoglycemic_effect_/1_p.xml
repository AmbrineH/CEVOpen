 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (G5003, Sigma, St. Luis., MO, USA). On one hand, the hexane and methanolic extracts exhibited a weak inhibitory effect while the ethyl acetate extract showed a strong inhibitory effect. On the other hand, only ursolic acid demonstrated to be the most promising compound with an IC
