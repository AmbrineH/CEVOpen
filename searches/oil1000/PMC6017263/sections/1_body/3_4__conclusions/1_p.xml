<p class="p">Finally, and after discuss the showed results, it is important to point out few conclusions in this work. First, the fact that this investigation was realized in view that some organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) encourage the use of herbal medicines for some diseases like diabetes, especially in a country like Ecuador with wide use of medicinal plants. The phytochemical investigation of organic extracts was successfully carried out. Six known compounds were isolated and characterized from the aerial parts of the species. The identification of triterpenes, among others, as the major compounds present in 
 <italic class="italic">C. taxifolium</italic> is consistent with reports from other species of this genus. Unfortunately, none of the isolated metabolites showed antibacterial activity. However, the results with α-glucosidase inhibition clearly encourage further studies with this plant. The fact that the EtOAc fraction, from which was isolated the ursolic acid (5), showed the best IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, inclusive compared with the Acarbose, indicate a possible synergic effect of the different compounds present in this fraction. Further studies will be necessary to characterize minor components, which could be also responsible of the strong α-glucosidase inhibition showed.
