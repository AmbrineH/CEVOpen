<p class="p">The choice of Î±-glucosidase as a molecular target of active compounds has been determined by the diffusion of diabetes as a common disease in Ecuador. According to official data of the INEC (National Institute of Statistics and Census of Ecuador), referred to 2016 [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-00146" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], diabetes is the second cause of death in the country. The incidence of diabetes as cause of mortality is rapidly increasing, as it grew by 51% during the last ten years. Hence, the discovery of new active principles for anti-diabetes drugs can be considered a health priority. In particular, the presence of active compounds in natural sources is of great interest, because the use of natural products is very common in Ecuador. In fact, due to the high price of imported drugs, medicinal plants are an important complement to allopathic medicine, especially in countryside.
