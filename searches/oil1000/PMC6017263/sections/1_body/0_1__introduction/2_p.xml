<p class="p">Many methods are known to identify bioactive molecules from plant extracts. A very common approach is the so-called bioguided fractionation. It consists of setting up a fractionation scheme, and to screen fractions for the presence of the desired bioactive properties. Active fractions are further sub-fractionated and tested, until pure molecules responsible for the bioactivity can be identified. By the common procedures of thin-layer chromatography and column chromatography, coupled to spectroscopic techniques, the metabolites (contained in fractions previously identified as biologically active) can be characterized. The present study was performed by applying this procedure to anti Î±-glucosidase compounds in the Ecuadorian plant
