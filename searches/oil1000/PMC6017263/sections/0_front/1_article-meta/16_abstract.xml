 <p class="p">The phytochemical investigation of both volatile and fixed metabolites of 
  <italic class="italic">Clinopodium taxifolium</italic> (Kunth) Govaerts (Lamiaceae) was performed for the first time. It allowed the isolation and characterization of the essential oil and six known compounds: carvacrol (
  <bold class="bold">1</bold>), squalane (
  <bold class="bold">2</bold>), uvaol (
  <bold class="bold">3</bold>), erythrodiol (
  <bold class="bold">4</bold>), ursolic acid (
  <bold class="bold">5</bold>), and salvigenin (
  <bold class="bold">6</bold>). Their structures were identified and characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS), and corroborated by literature. The essential oil of the leaves was obtained by hydrodistillation in two different periods and analyzed by GC-MS and GC coupled to Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). A total of 54 compounds were detected, of which 42 were identified (including trace constituents). The major constituents were carvacrol methyl ether (18.9–23.2%), carvacrol (13.8–16.3%) and, carvacryl acetate (11.4–4.8%). The antibacterial activities were determined as Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) against 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Micrococcus luteus</italic>. The hexane and methanol extracts exhibited activity only against 
  <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (250 and 500 μg/mL respectively), while the ethyl acetate extract was inactive. The hypoglycemic activity was evaluated by the in vitro inhibition of α-glucosidase. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract showed strong inhibitory activity with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 24.88 µg/mL, however methanolic and hexanic extracts showed weak activity. As a pure compound, only ursolic acid showed a strong inhibitory activity, with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 72.71 μM.
