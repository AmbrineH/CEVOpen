<p class="p">Cumin essential oil used in this research improved fermentation, and affected chemical and microbiological characteristics of silages. Especially the addition of 300 mg/kg cumin provided cell wall fractionation through stimulating activities of enzymes that fractionate cell walls. It also increased the number and activity of LAB through providing a development of LAB. Correspondingly, the transformation of sugar into LA, and lactic acid present in the environment at high amount decreased the pH level, thus inhibited proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins and the transformation of proteins into ammonia decreased. In addition, it increased ESOM amount, and concordantly provided an increase of ME contents. Similarly, DMI and RFV ratio increased. After opening the silage, it kept its aerobic stability for three days.</p>
