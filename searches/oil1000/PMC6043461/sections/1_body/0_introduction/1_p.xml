 <italic class="italic">Medicago sativa</italic>) is one of the most important forage plants given to livestock as hay. However, a significant amount of nutrient loss occurs due to the mechanical treatments during drying and storage process [
 <xref rid="b1-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Recently, especially in regions with copious amount of precipitation, where there is not enough opportunity to dry late harvested alfalfa, it is usually processed as silage. Alfalfa as green forage for silage is classified as difficult to silage due to its high protein level and buffer capacity and its low water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) ingredients. Therefore, it becomes compulsory to use additives in order to silage forage such as alfalfa [
