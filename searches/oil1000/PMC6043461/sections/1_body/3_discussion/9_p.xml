<p class="p">The quality of forage is usually determined through the calculations of physical, chemical, and biological values of forages. RFV developed in the USA for alfalfa and other forages, is used widely to measure the feeding value of forages. In this method, for the calculation of RFV, values of NDF and ADF were used. At full bloom RFV is taken as 100 and the more this value decreases, the more the quality of forage decreases, while the increase of RFV shows that the quality of forage is increasing. The forage quality was lower when RFV decreased below 100, and was higher when RFV increased [

The decrease of cell wall components (NDF and ADL) that cause difficulties in the digestion in alfalfa silages affected the RFV positively. RFV determined in alfalfa silages, when compared to 100 points of alfalfa plant, it is approved to be a rough forage with highest quality. RFV of silages increased through the use of cumin essential oil, and the highest value was found out in CMN3 group.
