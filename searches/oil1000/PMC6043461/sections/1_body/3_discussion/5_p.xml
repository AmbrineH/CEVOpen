<p class="p">While high level LA production causes pH level to decrease to 4.0, it also limits proteolytic activity [
 <xref rid="b21-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. It is possible that the decrease of contents in NDF, ADF, and ADL is due to the effect of pH. Thus, the increase of ESOM in the same group also supports this situation. Besides, in the same group, the highest LAB level and correspondingly high LA level and low WSC level, as well as high level of CP and low amount of NH

 <xref rid="b5-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] determined that LA content decreased in field peas silages opened on the 60th day after the addition of oregano, cinnamon, and oregano+cinnamon essential oils. However, in this study it was determined that there was an increase in LA contents. While oregano and cinnamon essential oils reveal a decreasing effect on LA amount through inhibiting LAB, cumin essential oil caused increase in LA amount by promoting LAB activity. The increase of LAB amount and the decrease in WSC in CMN3 and CMN5 groups also support this idea. WL decreased in groups with cumin essential oil, and the lowest level of WL was in CMN5. Thus, it can be interpreted that microorganisms which find sufficient amount of WSC in the environment develop better and provide high quality silage and decrease WL [
