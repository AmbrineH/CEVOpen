<p class="p">The addition of cumin essential oil was not effective on DM, and revealed no similarity with the findings of Soycan-Önenç et al [
 <xref rid="b5-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. While the findings of this study carried out through the addition of cumin essential oil, which has antimicrobial effect as in antibiotics, revealed pH level of 4.37 at CMN5 group similar to the findings of Kung et al [
 <xref rid="b20-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], the pH levels of all the other groups were lower than the findings of Bolsen et al [
 <xref rid="b23-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. On the other hand, Soycan-Önenç et al [
 <xref rid="b5-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] determined the pH level to be 4.4 and 4.47 on the 60th day through the addition of oregano and cinnamon essential oil to field peas. Cumin essential oil used in this study includes 44.47% cuminaldehyde, 12.12% carvacrol, and 8.82% paracymen as basic components. Cuminaldehyde and carvacrol have a selective antimicrobial effect [
 <xref rid="b24-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], which decreased the number of detrimental microorganisms (yeast and mould), and increased the number of beneficial microorganisms (LAB). This situation explains the low pH levels determined at CMN3 and CMN5 groups. A low pH level in silages opens the epicyte fractions by increasing acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose [
 <xref rid="b22-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Sucrose is liberated during enzymatic cell wall hydrolysis and provides an additional substrate that LAB can use to produce LA.
