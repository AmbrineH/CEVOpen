<p class="p">In this research, crude ash (CA) level at three groups was found to be higher than the determined amount at alfalfa silages in the researches of Lindgren et al [
 <xref rid="b21-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Results obtained from studies revealing the crude ash content level at inoculant added silages [
 <xref rid="b21-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] indicate that inoculant addition does not provide a significant decrease in the amount of CA. The reason for different CA levels determined in silages is that products for silage include inorganic matter (soil, etc.) at different levels [
 <xref rid="b22-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In this research, it is estimated that due to the control group being prepared last, it is possible that it includes more soil etc. and therefore it includes more crude ash content compared to cumin essential oil added groups. In this case, it is possible that the difference among OM value in groups is caused by crude ash content.
