<p class="p">Before being exposed to aerobic conditions, it is stated that population of yeast and mould, as well as WSC are positively related to LA and LAB [

However, WSC contents being very high provide a resource for the development of yeast and mould. Therefore, cumin essential oil could not suppress the development of yeast and mould sufficiently. WSC contents were affected by withering. There are studies carried out to determine that the aerobic decomposition of silages increase according to their exposure to aerobic conditions [
