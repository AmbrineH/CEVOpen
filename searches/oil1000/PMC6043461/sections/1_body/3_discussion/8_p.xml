<p class="p">The use of formic acid based preservative (FAB) in a research carried out by Filya et al [
 <xref rid="b29-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], increased the degradability of DM and OM of corn silages. The antimicrobial property of FAB prevented the development of 
 <italic class="italic">enterobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">clostridia</italic> spores, particularly yeast and mould, and this caused DM and OM degradability of silages to increase. Cumin essential oil used in this research revealed a similar effect with formic acid, thus increased the amount of OM dissolved in the enzyme significantly in comparison with the CON group (p&lt;0.05).
