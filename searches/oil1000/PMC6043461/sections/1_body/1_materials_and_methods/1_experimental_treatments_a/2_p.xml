<p class="p">The level of cumin essential oil was determined according to previous studies. For every group, 6 kg withered alfalfa was spread on the ground separately and was sprayed with uniform cumin essential oil (300 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg). Approximately 2 kg of sample was put into plastic bags and air was vacuumed out of the bags. These bags were covered 8 to 10 times with stretch wrap and finally were sealed with adhesive tape. Nine packages were prepared in total as triplicate of silage for each group and were kept in a closed storage (8°C±2°C) for 120 for fermentation.</p>
