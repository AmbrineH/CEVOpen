<p class="p">For microbial enumeration 9 replicete used for each trial groups. This purpose, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), yeast and mould were determined according to Seale et al [
 <xref rid="b13-ajas-31-8-1252" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In the enumeration of LAB, plates of Rogosa agar (Oxoid CM627) were used and the yeast was on spread plate malt extract agar acidified with LA to pH 4.0. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30Â°C. The LAB, mould and yeast numbers of the silages were converted into logarithmic colony form unit (cfu/g).
