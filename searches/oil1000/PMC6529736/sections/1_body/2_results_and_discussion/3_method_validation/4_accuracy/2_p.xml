<p id="p0095" class="p">The accuracy of an analytical method is used to determine the closeness of the measured value to the true value. Accuracy of a method is generally determined by recovery of the analyte spiked into a placebo matrix. In general, the recovery at each level is determined by comparison to the known amount added. For a major component assay, spiked levels typically should be at 50%, 100% and 150% of the level expected for the analyte in a normal assay 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. For accuracy analysis, three different concentrations (50, 100 and 150 Î¼g/mL corresponding to 50%, 100% and 150%, respectively) of standard MeJA were prepared and spiked with placebo samples. Each sample was injected in triplicate and recovery was determined by comparing the obtained concentration with the nominal concentration.
