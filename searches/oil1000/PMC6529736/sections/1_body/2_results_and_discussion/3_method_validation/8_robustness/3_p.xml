 <sub class="sub">s</sub> were noted upon applying small variations to the chromatographic conditions indicating that the method was robust to small deliberate changes. The robustness of the method was further demonstrated by the presence of well-resolved peak of MeJA following the changes in the chromatographic conditions.
