<p id="p0115" class="p">To determine LOD and LOQ, five different concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 μg/mL of MeJA) were prepared by diluting the sample solution of MeJA-MRC with mobile phase and subsequently injected into the HPLC system. The LOD and LOQ were then calculated by the following formulas as described elsewhere 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>.
 <disp-formula id="fd1" class="disp-formula">
  <label class="label">(1)</label>LOD= 3.3 σ/S
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula id="fd2" class="disp-formula">
  <label class="label">(2)</label>LOQ= 10 σ/S
 </disp-formula>where, σ and S are the intercept and slope of the calibration curve, respectively.
