<p id="p0130" class="p">The results of system suitability parameters are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">TableÂ 2</xref>a and they were within the accepted range. MeJA was repeatedly retained and well separated at 4.5 min with %RSD less than 1% (as per the USP 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[29]</xref>, %RSD should be &lt;1) indicating good repeatability of replicate injections on the integral HPLC system used. In addition, it was established that 
 <italic class="italic">k=</italic> 0.86. In general, 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> affects peak resolution. The resolution usually worsens or improves depending on whether 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> becomes smaller or increases. Better 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> values are achieved by changing either the mobile phase composition or the stationary phase 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. In contrast, changes in the column conditions such as flow rate, column length and particle size do not affect 
 <italic class="italic">k.</italic> Ideally, a precise and rugged method should have 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> greater than 1.5 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. The present method exhibited 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> of 5.82 thus indicating an optimum 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> value. The acceptance limit of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> &lt; 1.5 was achieved with this method and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> never exceeded 1.26; indicating excellent peak symmetry. Finally, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> always exceeded 2000 in all chromatographic runs, which ensured good column efficacy throughout the developed separation process.
