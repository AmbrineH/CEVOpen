<p id="p0145" class="p">To generate reproducible and reliable results, the samples, standards, and reagents used for the HPLC analysis must remain stable for a reasonable time. To investigate the stability, sample solution of MeJA-MRC containing 100 μg/mL of MeJA was prepared and assessed after 24 h in auto-sampler, after 24 h at room temperature and after a week in the refrigerator (2–8 °C). Further, the sample solution was injected into the HPLC system at day 0, 15, 30 and 60 and their corresponding areas were compared to determine the content of MeJA. Typically, stable solutions result in uniformity in content with least standard deviations.</p>
