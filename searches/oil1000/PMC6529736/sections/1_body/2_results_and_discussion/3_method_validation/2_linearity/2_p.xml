<p id="p0075" class="p">The linearity of a method is used to determine how well the data fits to the linear equation. In other words it is the measure of how well a calibration plot of the response vs. analyte concentration approximates a straight line 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. For system linearity, five analyte concentrations were used to obtain a calibration curve. The stock sample solution of MeJA-MRC was diluted with mobile phase to prepare solutions of MeJA containing 25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 μg/mL. A fixed volume (20 μL) of each solution was injected in triplicate into the HPLC column and their corresponding responses were recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to validate the linearity of the developed method (GraphPad Instat. version-3.05).
