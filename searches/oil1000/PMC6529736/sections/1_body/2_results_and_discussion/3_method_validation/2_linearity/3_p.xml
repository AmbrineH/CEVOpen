<p id="p0080" class="p">The calibration curve was linear over the range of 25–300 μg/mL. The equation of the calibration curve based on the peak response was y = 3.987x + 2.491 with a correlation coefficient (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of 0.999. The results obtained from linear regression analysis indicated the significance of the proposed method with a p value ˂0.005. Ideally, a calibration curve should be linear with a R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value of 0.999 and have a zero intercept 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. The intercept obtained in this experiment was not zero though; it was found quite low as 2.491 with the R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value approaching unity, thus suggesting the linearity of the method.
