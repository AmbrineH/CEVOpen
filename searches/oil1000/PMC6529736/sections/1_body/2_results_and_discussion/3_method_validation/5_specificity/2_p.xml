The potential effects from matrix components used in MeJA-MRC was investigated, where placebo matrix was composed of silicon oil (Sigma Aldrich); cetostearyl alcohol, glycerine, glycerine monostearate, light liquid paraffin, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, stearic acid and tocopherol (HiMedia); and Aquagel 35S
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (Tinci Materials Technology Co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China). The specificity of the proposed method for determination of MeJA was established by injecting mobile phase, placebo matrix extracted solution, pure MeJA (100 μg/mL) and MeJA-MRC (100 μg/mL) solution into the HPLC system with a run time of 10 min. The resultant chromatograms were then examined for the presence of any interfering peaks at the retention time of MeJA. The specificity of the method was further validated by injecting a fixed concentration (100 μg/mL) of MeJA-MRC and determination of peak purity factor of the resultant peak.
