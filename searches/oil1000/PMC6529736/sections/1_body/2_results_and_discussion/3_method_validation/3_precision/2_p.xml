<p id="p0085" class="p">The precision of the method was established by determining the system precision including intra-day and inter-day precision, and repeatability and was expressed as %RSD. Ideally, the %RSD value should be less than 2% 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. For intra-day and inter-day precision evaluations, three different concentrations (50, 100 and 200 μg/mL of MeJA) were prepared by diluting stock sample solution of MeJA-MRC and each solution was injected in triplicate in the same day and different days, respectively and their %RSD values were calculated. While, repeatability of the method was determined by injecting six replicate injections of the sample (100 μg/mL) and %RSD was calculated.
