<p id="p0070" class="p">MeJA is an oily liquid, and remained as a neutral molecule during the separation. Thus, the mobile phase may be a simple combination of organic solvent and water, and a buffer solution is not required. Two different solvent systems, acetonitrile and methanol were tested for continuous measurement of MeJA (Supplementary Figure 1). It was observed that the acetonitrile-water system gave a well-resolved peak and a better resolution than the methanol-water system, providing suitable retention time for MeJA. Further, separation parameters such as retention time, peak area and plates count obtained with the acetonitrile-water system were better than the methanol-water system (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, an unknown peak was observed with methanol-water system at 5.8 min that may directly influence the accurate quantitation of MeJA. Results obtained in this experiment are similar to other previous findings. For example, Xia et al., 2010 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref> developed and validated a method for the quantification of linalool using acetonitrile and water as a mobile phase. In their experiments, this mobile phase composition also generated similar well-resolved peaks as obtained in this investigation. Compositions of the mobile phase (60:40, 65:35, 70:30, 75:25, 80:20 and 85:15) have also exerted similar influences on the separation especially peak spacing and resolution. Significant changes in the band spacing with improved peak resolution were evident with the increased concentration of organic solvent i.e. acetonitrile. However, a decrease in the concentration of acetonitrile resulted in increased retention with varied selectivity, band spacing and resolution. Thus, careful selection of both solvent type and composition is essential for successful method development. Finally, acetonitrile and water: (75:25 v/v) was found to be the ideal mobile phase composition for the quantification of MeJA. Similarly, the influence of flow rates (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mL/min) was also found to affect the separation. As the flow rate varied, the retention time of MeJA also varied. The optimum flow rate was found to be 1.0 mL/min. At this flow rate, the

Generally, reversed phase chromatographic separation of neutral compounds at higher temperatures results in decrease selectivity

 <sub class="sub">18</sub> column, a DAD detector, a solvent system comprising of acetonitrile:water (75:25 v/v) with flow rate 1 mL/min and 214 nm detection wavelength was chosen as the most suitable conditions for the proposed analytical method. Symmetric and well defined peak of MeJA with an average retention of 4.5 min was observed with the above conditions. The percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) was less than 2% and column pressure was found well below the defined limit. Ideally, column pressure ˂150 bar is desirable; and ˂200 bar is usually essential
