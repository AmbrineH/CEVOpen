<p id="p0060" class="p">In the present contribution, we attempted to develop and validate a RP-HPLC/DAD method for the quantification of MeJA in a cream formulation. In this investigation, theoretical and empirical approaches were combined for successful method development and validation. The theoretical approach included the understanding of the physico-chemical characteristics of MeJA that allows the selection of appropriate chromatographic conditions from the available vast literatures. The development of the preliminary method was therefore based on the compilation of comprehensive information of MeJA including molecular mass, solubility, partition coefficient, chemical structure and functionality and UV absorption spectrum. Solubility is an important aspect since it helps to select the suitable mobile phase compositions and column to be used in HPLC method development. MeJA is very slightly soluble in water (340 mg/L at 25 °C) but freely soluble in alcohol. Therefore, ethanol was used for preparing the stock solution of MeJA. Chemically, MeJA (molar mass: 224.3 g/mol; logP: 2.76) is methyl (1R,2R)-3-Oxo-2-(2Z)-2-pentenyl cyclopentaneacetate that contains an ester and a ketone group, and a cyclopentane parent ring (
