<p id="p0065" class="p">Taking into account the physico-chemical characteristics of MeJA, both C
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> and C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> analytical columns were used for the analysis of MeJA. C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> column displayed better results than the C

 <sub class="sub">s</sub>). To finalize the optimum absorbance, the instrument's LOD was obtained for 214 and 293 nm by DAD detector. Ideally, a good method should exhibit minimum LOD while deciding a detection wavelength. In addition, the peak area should be maximum at the selected wavelength 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>. It is worthy to note that, the minimum LOD was obtained at 214 nm with suitable precision and accuracy. Moreover, the corresponding peak area of MeJA was maximum at this wavelength. Importantly, co-eluting interferences that may likely to appear due the presence of excipients were also absent for this wavelength at the retention time of MeJA (4.5 min). Sensitivity obtained for 293 nm was in-adequate with the proposed analytical method. The selection of the optimum wavelength was further confirmed by peak purity of the resultant peak. At 214 nm, spectra of MeJA exhibited a threshold and similarity curve (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>a), where later was found below the threshold curve. Moreover, all diamonds (each diamond represents the scan path) were found at the green zone. As per the manufacturer instructions, the above conditions persist when a single compound is present in a sample solution (Agilent technologies). Additionally, 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>b presented a superimposable peak. It is worth to note that if a single component is present in a peak, the spectra obtained across peak should be superimposable 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. Thus, these findings indicated the presence of only MeJA in the sample solutions. Results obtained in this investigation are not at variance with our previous publication. In that particular contribution, we reported the peak purity while developing a method for the estimation of a mosquito repellent, ethyl anthranilate in a polymeric patch 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>. Thus, all requisite criteria were met at 214 nm and hence it was selected as an ideal detection wavelength with respect to sensitivity and conditions of the proposed analytical method.
