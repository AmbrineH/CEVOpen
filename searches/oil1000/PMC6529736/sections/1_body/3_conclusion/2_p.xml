<p id="p0160" class="p">The present investigation resulted in the development of an RP-HPLC/DAD analysis method for MeJA that was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity, system suitability and robustness. The method is rapid, precise, accurate, sensitive and easy to apply, making it suitable for the quantification of MeJA in MeJA-MRC and any other formulations. The method involves a single step procedure for the preparation of samples and direct injections. Moreover, the run time was also short (4.5 min). Therefore, the proposed analytical method is recommended for the routine analysis of MeJA as such, or in various dosage forms. In addition, the method can be applied in many developing countries or field stations where advanced analytical equipments such as LC/MS or GC/MS are not available. However, it may be necessary to verify the method if other polymers/excipients are used instead of polymers/excipients employed in this study. We speculate a two way outcome when using different polymers. The first one is the interference of polymers, or their monomer units with MeJA. The second one is the poor recovery due to the strong interaction between MeJA and polymers so that MeJA is encapsulated and cannot be extracted with the method used in the present study. This is why a release profile is usually needed when polymers and their rates are determined during encapsulation development.</p>
