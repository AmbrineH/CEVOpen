<p id="p0040" class="p">One gram of MeJA-MRC was transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask and extracted with 10 mL ethanol. The flask was then shaken mechanically for about 2 h for complete extraction of MeJA. The resultant mixture was then centrifuged at 6000× g for 20 min and the supernatant (1 mL) was collected. The supernatant was further diluted with mobile phase to obtain 300 μg/mL of MeJA, approximately. The aliquots were filtered through syringe filter (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Maharashtra, India) and injected subsequently for HPLC analysis.</p>
