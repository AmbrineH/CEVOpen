<p id="p0045" class="p">Preliminary method was developed and optimized as per the method described elsewhere with slight modifications 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>. Briefly, various HPLC parameters including columns, detection wavelengths, solvent systems, mobile phase compositions and flow rates were altered to obtain a set of suitable chromatographic conditions. However, detector, injection volume, oven temperature (25 ± 2 °C) and mode of elution remained unaltered during the process of method development and validation. A fixed concentration (100 μg/mL) of sample solution of MeJA-MRC was injected, and a spectrum at the desired wavelength was recorded. Finally, peak purity of the resultant chromatogram was evaluated to finalize the suitable detection wavelength. Other aspects that were typically considered in the preliminary method development include resolution, separation time, quantitation, column pressure, peak height and solvent consumption per run.
