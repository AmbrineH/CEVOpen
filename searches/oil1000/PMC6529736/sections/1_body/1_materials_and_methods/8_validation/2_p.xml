<p id="p0050" class="p">After obtaining the suitable chromatographic conditions, the method was validated as per the ICH Q2B guidelines 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref> by following the method as described elsewhere 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>. The method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), system suitability and robustness. Further, stability of reagents and solvents were investigated as described elsewhere
