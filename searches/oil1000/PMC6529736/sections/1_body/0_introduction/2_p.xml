<p id="p0010" class="p">Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an important phytohormone involved in the regulation of diverse developmental processes of plants, such as seed germination, root growth, tuber formation, fertility, fruit ripening, leaf senescence and so on [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. It also triggers unique plant defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses, such as insect-driven wounding, a range of pathogens, and ecological stresses, such as drought, low temperature and salinity [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. MeJA has also been proven to induce suppression of cellular proliferation and necrosis, and this expanded its potential application to cancer therapy [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Furthermore, MeJA has been found to cause aversion in number of ticks such as nymphal 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes ricinis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Hyalomma marginatum</italic> rufipes Koch, etc. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[9]</xref>. Most interestingly, MeJA has recently been implicated in repelling 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> act as a vector for numerous deadly pathogens including avian malaria parasite, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. These mosquito-vectored viruses are responsible for causing many severe human tropical diseases that incapacitate and seriously debilitate millions of people and unfortunately, decimate countless lives annually 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[11]</xref>. In addition, absence of vaccines and the lack of effective medical treatments for some of the diseases further alleviate the sufferings and economic consequences among populations 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[12]</xref>. Overwhelmingly, recent evidences on the involvement of 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes to vector zika virus (which is generally considered an 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes-</italic>transmitted pathogen) has raised grave concern [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Thus, these scientific findings advocate urgent strategies to control this mosquito vector. Despite numerous anti-mosquito formulations (of both synthetic and natural origins) are currently available on the market, the menace posed by this mosquito vector remains. It is important to note that applicability of many commercially available anti-mosquito formulations has lessened noticeably, and this can be attributed either to their ineffectiveness, toxic effects or the development of resistance in mosquitoes to these anti-mosquito formulations 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[12]</xref>. Therefore, there is a need to explore new and more efficient preventive measures against the 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes. To the best of our knowledge, insect repellent formulation containing MeJA has not been attempted to date in any form. Hence, there is a vast opportunity in formulation development.
