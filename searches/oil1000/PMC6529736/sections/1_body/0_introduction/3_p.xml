<p id="p0015" class="p">In view of the above, a semi-solid formulation, MeJA-loaded mosquito repellent cream (MeJA-MRC) was developed in our laboratory and its efficacy was investigated against laboratory-reared 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes. Although, MeJA-MRC has exhibited promising activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (data not shown), for practical applicability of MeJA-MRC, a suitable analytical technique is must for the quantification of MeJA adhering to the international standards. Available literatures have presented a number of analytical methods utilizing sophisticated LC-MS-MS

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[21]</xref> and HPLC-UV 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[22]</xref> based techniques for the quantitative analysis of MeJA. Although the effectiveness of these reported methods undoubtedly contribute to efficient separation of MeJA, they have nonetheless several disadvantages, which limit their application. For instances, LC-MS-MS, LC-ESI-MS/MS and SPME-GC-MS may not be available in all laboratories owing to the high capital cost of these equipments. Furthermore, complex instrumentation, extensive sample preparation schemes and requirements for a skilled labor force present major constraints that may impede the application of these highly sophisticated analytical instruments 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[23]</xref>. Similarly, PMME-HPLC, SPE-HPLC and SPME-HPLC require complex procedure of sample preparation, and involves relatively high consumption of reagents and longer run time 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[24]</xref>. Whilst a HPLC-UV method is available, this method necessitates the synthesis of fluorescent hydrazones of jasmonic acid by chemical derivatization to render the analyte quantifiable by HPLC. In addition, complex chromatographic conditions and long runs (Ëƒ 36 min) discourages the application of this method 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[22]</xref>. Thus, growing concern on the raised transmission of 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus-</italic>vectored diseases, absence of appropriate preventive measures and lack of simple and efficient analytical techniques prompted us to undertake this investigation. Hence, the present investigation focused on to the development of a reproducible, simple, fast and sensitive RP-HPLC method for the quantification of MeJA in MeJA-MRC and validate it conforming to the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)
