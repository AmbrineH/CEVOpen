 <p class="p">A simple and efficient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method has been developed for the first time for the estimation of a mosquito repellent, methyl jasmonate in a cream formulation, and validated as per the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Acetonitrile and water (75:25 v/v) were used as the mobile phase and the flow-rate of the mobile phase was kept constant at 1.0 mL/min. The analysis was performed isocratically on a C
  <sub class="sub">18</sub> analytical column (250 × 4.4 mm, 5 μm) using a Diode Array Detector for the detection of methyl jasmonate at 214 nm. The presence of excipients did not interfere with the quantification of methyl jasmonate. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration range of 25–300 μg/mL. The relative standard deviations for intra-day and inter-day precision, and repeatability were less than 2%. The recovery ranged from 88.5% to 90.7% with relative standard deviations not higher than 2%. The limit of detection and quantification were 9.4 μg/mL and 28.5 μg/mL, respectively. System suitability parameters were within the accepted range. The proposed method was also robust. Thus, the present report puts forward a novel analytical method for the estimation of an emerging mosquito repellent, methyl jasmonate by using the RP-HPLC technique.
