<p id="Par57" class="p">Chemical fingerprinting of secondary metabolites in biological samples requires a high spectral selectivity and sophisticated data evaluation. In complex biological material this is even more complicated due to the autofluorescence of the sample matrix, which however can also be used to get a more complete picture of the sample. In the here investigated glandular trichomes of a drug- and fibre-type of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] it has been shown that hyperspectral imaging of the blue-green fluorescence band with subsequent multivariate spectra separation in principle enables imaging of single phenolic metabolites in plant material (e.g. caffeine in coffee leaves).
