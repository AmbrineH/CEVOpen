These properties prevent a selective chemical identification of the essential oil in glandular trichomes even with sophisticated unmixing methods just based on fluorescence. Therefore, we use the blue-green fluorescence only to obtain a general distribution of organic fluorophores in the glandular trichomes. This organic fluorescence enables in combination with the fluorescence of chlorophyll
