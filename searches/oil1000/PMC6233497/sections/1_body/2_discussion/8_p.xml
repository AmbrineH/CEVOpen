<p id="Par64" class="p">Beside the lacking distinction of some chemically related compounds (e.g. CBDA and myrcene) one of our main drawbacks currently is the low sensitivity hindering the detection of compounds of lower abundance. The strong non-resonant background and the nonlinear character of CARS allow only the imaging and chemical identification of the most abundant substances [
