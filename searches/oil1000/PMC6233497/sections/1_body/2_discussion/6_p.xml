<p id="Par62" class="p">Unmixing of the raw F-HCARS data accounts mostly for variations of the absolute intensity in the hyperspectral images, yielding a height-like profile showing a downward gradient from the inner part of the secretory cavity to the outer part. Therefore, in order to visualise spectral differences of the secretory cavity and the disk cells of the drug type trichomes, the F-HCARS data are normalised before unmixing. Otherwise, unmixing can be performed on the non-normalised raw data as a means of noise reduction, e.g. on the corresponding EPI-HTPF data.</p>
