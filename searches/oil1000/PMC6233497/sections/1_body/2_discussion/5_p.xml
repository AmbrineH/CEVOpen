<p id="Par61" class="p">Regarding the second point we use an unmixing model originally employed in the field of geosensing that geometrically takes into account the nonlinear nature of the HCARS data and thus presumedly better reflects the actual spectral variations and abundances of the data. This approach captures fine spectral differences of the C-H stretching bands and separates them from the fluorescence and residual noise background. It has to be emphasised that such a geometry-based method does not necessarily provide access to the real concentration of an analyte but rather reflects the spectral differences in an image. For this reason we use terms from the field of unmixing (e.g. endmember, abundance) instead of more chemical related terms (e.g. concentration). To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a nonlinear unmixing method is applied to evaluate nonlinear CARS data of biological samples. Previous studies in the field of Raman micro-spectroscopy used linear mixing models like the popular VCA algorithm [
