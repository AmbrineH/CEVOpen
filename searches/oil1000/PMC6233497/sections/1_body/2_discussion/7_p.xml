<p id="Par63" class="p">Our results suggest that the new approach is suitable for chemical fingerprint imaging. In contrast to an earlier publication only one of the two reported CARS spectra (THC1) is detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. The unique spectrum of THCA enables its spectral identification in the trichomes. The combined results of HCA and abundance maps reveal that the secretory cavities of the drug-type derived trichomes contain mostly THCA. However, the similarity of spectra acquired from the secretory cavity of fibre-type samples or from the disk cells of drug-type trichomes to spectra of reference compounds is less clear. Spectra from the secretory cavities of the fibre-type derived trichomes fit well to spectra from both, CBDA and myrcene. As a consequence we cannot localise these substances individually in the samples. Likewise, spectra from disk cells of the drug type are similar to CBGA spectra, but show also slight differences, which may indicate the presence of a complex mixture of different aliphatic C-H rich substances instead. Nevertheless, the fact that we found THCA and CBDA/myrcene in the secretory cavity of the drug- and fibre-type, respectively, is in accordance with the chemo-type [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]: While the drug-type mostly accumulates THCA, it is known that the fibre-type accumulates CBDA as main cannabinoid inside the secretory cavity. Moreover, the spatial determination of the cannabinoids in our experiments of the drug-type is in accordance with literature-known investigations regarding the biosynthesis: While CBGA is thought to be produced inside the disk cells, the synthesis of THCA is most likely located inside the secretory cavity [
