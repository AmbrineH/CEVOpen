<p id="Par65" class="p">To overcome these limitations a combination of HCARS imaging with subsequent Raman micro-spectroscopy on regions of interest (e.g. secretory cavity, disk or stipe cells) might improve chemical selectivity and even allow the detection of less abundant components. In contrast to HCARS, Raman micro-spectroscopy gives easy access to the more discriminative fingerprint region below 2000 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>. Long acquisition times during Raman measurement would be kept to a minimum as Raman would only be used to measure a specific region of interest and not the whole sample. As spontaneous Raman is a linear effect it shows increased sensitivity towards lower abundant substances compared to CARS and might even allow absolute quantification for compounds of interest.
