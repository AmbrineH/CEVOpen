<p id="Par59" class="p">For the localisation of secondary metabolites in the glandular trichomes HCARS imaging is used, which contrary to the broad fluorescence bands delivers more and sharper peaks, enabling a more selective chemical identification. Garbacik et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>] already showed that HCARS imaging in the C-H stretching region is applicable for the detection of THCA inside the glandular trichome of dried and rehydrated plant material, but neither a clear spatial localisation was possible nor were further metabolites investigated. We obtain a more detailed view of the glandular trichomes both in terms of morphology and chemical information with HCARS imaging first by using a structure preserving sampling strategy and second by introduction of a nonlinear unmixing method for data analysis.
