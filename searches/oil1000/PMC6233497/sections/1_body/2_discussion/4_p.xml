Our measurements suggest that imaging of dried trichomes not necessarily reflects their native state since we were able to show that pseudo-morphological structures appear upon drying. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the cryofixation of the trichomes performed in this study might lead to the formation of cryo-artefacts, e.g. the damage of cell organelles or subcellular structures like the secretory vesicles of the cavity [
