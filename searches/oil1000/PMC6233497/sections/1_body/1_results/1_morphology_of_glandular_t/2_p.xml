<p id="Par43" class="p">Combined imaging of these two fluorescence phenomena with transmission (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>) enables to distinguish between different components of the glandular trichome, which are also resolved by the SEM micrograph (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). The overall structure of the glandular trichome is revealed by the transmission image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). It consist of a spherical head placed on a stalk. The head divides into a cellular part of strong organic fluorescence, the disk cells, and the secretory cavity. The latter shows a high light transparency rather than fluorescence revealing the presence of essential oil. The stalk shows organic fluorescence and red fluorescence of chlorophyll

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). The connection between the stalk and the head is facilitated by so-called stipe cells, which are clearly discriminable by the dominance of the red fluorescence of chlorophyll

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). The connection of the stipe cells towards the stalk and secretory cavity is visible in the SEM micrograph (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>).
