<p id="Par45" class="p">In forward direction signals of longer wavelength (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1c and g) are mostly emitted by the secretory cavity and attributed to CARS signals (F-CARS): These signals are most likely caused by the aliphatic C-H-rich substances of the essential oil inside the secretory cavity, which would be in accordance with the strong light transparency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). The forward directed signals of shorter wavelength (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1d and h) originate from the organic substance fluorescence and are comparable to those observed in backward direction but with much lower intensity. For this reason these signals were not considered further.
