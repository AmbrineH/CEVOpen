Fluorescence excitation of glandular trichomes at 561Â nm generates two types of fluorescence, a blue-green fluorescence and a red fluorescence. The origin of blue-green fluorescence is probably a mixture of different organic fluorophores. In this paper we refer to it as organic fluorescence. The red fluorescence is probably caused by chlorophyll
