 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>) show that the C-H stretching signal of the essential oil (red and orange, respectively) is only dominant in the secretory cavities. The stalk is dominated by TPF of organic substances (grey). Localisation of chloroplasts is revealed by TPF of chlorophyll

The secretory cavity of the fibre-type trichome shows a less prominent C-H stretching signal compared to the drug-type trichome and is more influenced by TPF from cell walls. It is worth noting that fibre-type trichomes appear to have smaller spatial dimensions compared to drug-type trichomes regarding the total length (260 μm for fibre-type versus 400 μm for drug type) and the diameter of the secretory cavity (70 μm versus 80 μm).The 3D structure of a dissected glandular head from a drug-type trichome sheds light at the connection between the stipe cells, disk cells and the secretory cavity (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Differentiation between the disk cells and secretory cavity is realized by the pronounced TPF of organic substances (grey) from the disk cells compared the low fluorescence signals from the secretory cavity. The stipe cells are discriminable by TPF of chlorophyll 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> in backward direction (green, em 560–750 nm), which can also be seen in forward direction (red). F-HCARS data suggest that the forward directed light in the CARS channel (em 560–750 nm) is only due to fluorescence, since it shows a slightly increasing baseline but does not contain C-H stretching signals. Since the intensity in the F-CARS channel coincides with the position of the stipe cells, we assume it to be TPF signals of chlorophyll
