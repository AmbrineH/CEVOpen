<p id="Par48" class="p">Spectral unmixing of the HCARS data recorded in forward direction (F-HCARS) is achieved by using four endmembers per sample. The chemical fingerprint information is revealed by the endmember spectra and its spatial distribution by the corresponding relative abundance maps. For the drug-type samples two endmembers describe the C-H stretching, one endmember contains fluorescence and the last endmember residual noise. For the fibre-type samples one endmember describes the C-H stretching, one endmember the fluorescence and two endmembers the residual noise. F-HCARS spectra of reference substances are unmixed in the same way but using only two endmembers (CH-stretching, residual noise) due to the reduced sample complexity. Beside the cannabinoids, the most abundant monoterpenes and fatty acids (Fig.
