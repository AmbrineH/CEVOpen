<p id="Par50" class="p">For drug-type derived trichomes HCA reveals a similarity of the endmembers that show high relative abundances in the secretory cavity (BCav) to the spectrum of pure THCA, indicating a distinct accumulation of THCA inside the secretory cavity. The spectra of the disk cells (Bdisk) are clearly distinguishable from the spectra of the secretory cavity (BCav). They show a similarity to CBGA suggesting an accumulation of this cannabinoid in the disk cells of drug-type derived trichomes. However, the broad C-H signal might also indicate a complex mixture of different C-H-rich substances inside the disk cells.</p>
