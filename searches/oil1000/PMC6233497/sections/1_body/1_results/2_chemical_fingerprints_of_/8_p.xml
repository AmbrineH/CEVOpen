<p id="Par54" class="p">To provide an entire picture of the spatial distribution of metabolites together with morphological structure, we combine the unmixed F-HCARS data with the corresponding unmixed data recorded in backward direction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), which are dominated by two-photon fluorescence (EPI-HTPF; see also EPI-TPF in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The prominent organic fluorescence of the disk cells in the drug-type trichomes allows to distinguish these cells from the secretory cavity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>). The C-H stretching signal corresponding to CBGA and/or a complex mixture of C-H-rich substances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>) occurs in the same region as the organic fluorescence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5e</xref>), revealing that the respective compounds are almost exclusively localised inside the disk cells.
