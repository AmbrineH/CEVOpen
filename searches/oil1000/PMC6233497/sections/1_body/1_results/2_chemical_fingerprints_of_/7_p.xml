<p id="Par53" class="p">The similarity of CBDA and myrcene in the investigated spectral region prevents a distinction between these substances with our method. Consequently, their independent localisation within the samples was not possible. This clearly marks the limitation of the currently applied method. By contrast, THCA shows distinct spectral features, allowing its identification and localisation with the endmember approach.</p>
