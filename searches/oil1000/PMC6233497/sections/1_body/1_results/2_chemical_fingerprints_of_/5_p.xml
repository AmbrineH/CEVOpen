<p id="Par51" class="p">In contrast to the drug-type derived trichomes endmembers from the secretory cavity of fibre-type derived trichomes (FCav) reveal a spectral fingerprint most similar to CBDA/myrcene according to HCA results. This observation indicates the possibility to differentiate trichomes of the fibre- and drug-type by the spectral fingerprint of the essential oil stored in the secretory cavity, which is not accessible by CARS imaging at single band frequencies.</p>
