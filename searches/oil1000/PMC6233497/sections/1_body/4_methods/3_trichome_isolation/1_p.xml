 <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> var. Fedora flower buds was performed from plant material snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen trichomes were broken from the sepal surface directly over a coverslip (Cover slips # 1, Menzel-Gl√§ser) either with a cooled stainless steel tip or with a lasso formed by a tungsten wire. The isolation was performed under a stereo zoom microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at room temperature.
