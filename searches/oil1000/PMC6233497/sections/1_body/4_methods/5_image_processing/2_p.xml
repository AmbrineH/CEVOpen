<p id="Par76" class="p">In unmixing of hyperspectral images, one usually assumes that the endmembers and abundances are unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. In a first step the endmembers have to be identified by an endmember extraction algorithm (EEA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Several of these EEAs assume that endmember spectra are present in the data itself. These so-called purest pixels contain only a single endmember component. In a second step the abundance of each endmember is usually estimated by minimisation of the error by a non-negative least squares algorithm.
