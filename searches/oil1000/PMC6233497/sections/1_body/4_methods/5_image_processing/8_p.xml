<p id="Par82" class="p">TPF emission images at 380–560 nm and at 560–750 nm were obtained by unmixing of the two EPI-HTPF data in the range from 787.5 nm to 839.9 nm pump excitation. We used two endmembers, one endmember mostly describing the increasing baseline typical for fluorescence and one endmember describing residual noise. Normalisation on these data was not applied, since this would render fluorescence indistinguishable from the background noise: Fluorescence information here is mostly contained in the spectral intensity rather than spectral shape. Normalisation would therefore erase this spectral information.</p>
