<p id="Par80" class="p">Unmixing of CARS signals was applied in the range of the C-H stretching region of the F-HCARS images (2760–3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>). Laser intensity fluctuations along x and y were eliminated by smooth two-dimensional median filtering along a 3-by-3 neighbourhood around the corresponding pixel. To force an unmixing regarding the spectral shape instead of spectral intensity, the data were vector normalised prior to umixing. The number of endmembers was chosen so that at least one endmember contained mostly spectral noise. This resulted in four endmembers for trichome samples and two for reference substances.
