<p id="Par73" class="p">For (H)CARS imaging a picosecond one-box laser system (picoEMERALD™, APE GmbH) was used. Hyperspectral images were recorded by tuning the pump laser frequency from 787.5 nm to 839.9 nm (step size 0.7 nm, 76 steps, scan speed 10 Hz, 1024 × 1024 pixel) while keeping the Stokes laser constant at 1064 nm corresponding to a spectral region of 2500 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> – 3300 cm
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>. CARS and two-photon fluorescence signals were collected with an IR-light optimised HC PL IRAPO 40x/1.10 WATER objective and split through optical windows into light of longer and shorter wavelength (560–750 nm and 380–560 nm, respectively) both in forward and backward direction. This resulted in four simultaneously acquired channels using photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as detectors: F-CARS, F-TPF and two EPI-TPFs. Hyperspectral data are denoted with and additional H (e.g. F-HCARS).
