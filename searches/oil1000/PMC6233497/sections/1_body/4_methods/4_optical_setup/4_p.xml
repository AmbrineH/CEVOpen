<p id="Par74" class="p">Single-photon fluorescence images were obtained at the same instrument but in a confocal setup with 561 nm excitation wavelength (DPSS Laser), prism spectrum generation and spectrum separation by cascade-like movable mirrors and recording in backward direction with two HyD detectors set to 580–630 nm and 660–700 nm. Specifications of the HyD detectors can be found in the description by the manufacturer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. Transmission images were recorded with PMTs in forward position (F-CARS and F-TPF). In order to determine the origin of the fluorescence we also recorded fluorescence emission spectra by collecting light stepwise at different emission bands (em 570–745 nm, step size 5 nm, 35 steps).
