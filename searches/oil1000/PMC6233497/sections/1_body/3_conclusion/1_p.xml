<p id="Par66" class="p">In the work presented we successfully apply a CARS imaging setup to visualise the main cannabinoids in intact 
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis</italic> glandular trichomes and to distinguish between different cell types. We also employ absorption and (two-photon) fluorescence spectroscopy to obtain more structural information in order to identify different compartments and cells types. HCARS imaging in combination with a nonlinear spectral unmixing method offers the possibility to discriminate between THCA-rich and CBDA-rich 
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis</italic> plants with a label-free method on single-trichome level with chemical selectivity and high spatial resolution. Furthermore, the essential oil distribution and the whole trichome morphology can be visualised in 3D by a combination of CARS and TPF. Since this kind of visualisation allows to screen for differences in the chemical composition of single trichomes, the variance within a single plant or among the same genotype is now accessible. Additionally, this method can be used to investigate the influence of abiotic factors -like temperature and light- on the essential oil composition, or to determine optimal harvest times to optimize production conditions.
