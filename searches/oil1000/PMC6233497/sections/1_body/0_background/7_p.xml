<p id="Par41" class="p">The aim of this study is to analyse secondary metabolites in glandular 
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis</italic> trichomes with distinct spatial resolution. This is achieved by using HCARS imaging in combination with a nonlinear unmixing method. Furthermore, we combine these information with transmission images as well as single-photon and two-photon fluorescence delivering additional morphological information. This multi-modal approach allows to investigate samples regarding their morphology as well as their content of specific secondary metabolites such as THCA and CBDA without extracting the essential oil.
