<p id="Par38" class="p">In order to obtain such spatial information optical techniques are frequently utilised for biological issues. Traditional white light optical microscopy gives an overview of sample morphology due to the sample’s intrinsic distinct light transmission. A better differentiated and fine structured image can be obtained by (single-photon) fluorescence microscopy, which, however, for most applications requires labelling of the sample with fluorescent dyes as autofluorescence [
