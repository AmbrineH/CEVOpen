 <italic class="italic">Cannabis</italic>, the most widely used illicit drug worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], experiences a renaissance in medical use since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. For example, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is used for the treatment of the symptoms of e.g. neurological diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>], multiple sclerosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] or cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Other cannabinoids like cannabidiol (CBD), terpenes and phenolic compounds show further pharmacological effects, which make this plant a highly interesting pharmaceutical target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. The biosynthesis of these metabolites typically occurs in specialised plant surface structures, so-called glandular trichomes. Trichomes are epidermal structures that are widespread among plants showing a multitude of functions in physical as well as biological stress responses or ecological interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>] and can be divided into non-glandular and glandular trichomes. 
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis</italic> exhibits both, two different types of non-glandular hairs and two groups of glandular trichomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. The first group of glands is a collection of trichomes with different shapes and architecture but they all have a small swollen head on a short stalk. The second group are capitate glands that have a large globular head and (massive) stalks. They are produced on flowering bracts of female flowers and on anthers of male flowers. These glands are thought to be the primary site of cannabinoid biosynthesis and storage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>].Therefore, only glandular trichomes were analysed in this study.
