<p id="Par40" class="p">CARS imaging at different Raman vibrations – so-called hyperspectral CARS imaging (HCARS) – combines imaging with spectroscopy and allows for the differentiation between different substances with the use of sophisticated data evaluation methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]: Each pixel in an image consists of a spectrum, which reflects the chemical composition or chemical fingerprint at that position. One possibility to identify single components from such a fingerprint is the spectral decomposition into several constituents – so-called endmembers, each ideally (but not necessarily) representing one substance. The abundance of each endmember in each pixel is subsequently determined by hyperspectral unmixing. The most popular unmixing model (coming from remote sensing) is the linear unmixing model, which assumes that the observed spectrum is a linear combination of endmember spectra with corresponding positive abundances and possibly additive noise [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. This assumption is not necessarily valid for CARS data, which are intrinsically highly nonlinear due to the signal generation itself. This nonlinearity is conventionally eliminated by using phase retrieval methods (e.g. maximum entropy method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>] or time-domain Kramers–Kronig relations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]). These methods deliver the imaginary part of the so-called resonant signal, which is directly proportional to the spontaneous Raman signal and thus linear to the analyte concentration. Consequently, a subsequent linear unmixing is feasible. However, phase retrieval is a non-trivial problem, especially when dealing with highly complex biological samples. Accounting for the nonlinearities in the unmixing method itself is an alternative approach. Here we apply a nonlinear unmixing algorithm developed by Heylen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>], which accounts for the nonlinearities in the HCARS data in a geometrical based approach and thus should enable to find suitable endmembers and deliver corresponding abundances without requiring phase retrieval (for details see Methods section).
