 <p> Overlay of F-HCARS relative abundance maps and EPI-HTPF abundance maps of C. sativa var. Bedrobinol ( a) and C. sativa var. Fedora ( b). Red: C-H stretching signal similar to THCA; Yellow: C-H stretching signal most similar to CBGA; Orange: C-H stretching similar to CBDA/myrcene, White: TPF of organic substances (em 380–560 nm); Green: TPF of chlorophyll a (em 560–750 nm). Detailed picture of Bedrobinol disk cells ( c- e). TPF of organic substances highlight the disk cell morphology ( c), F-HCARS signals indicate the presence of CBGA and/or a complex mixture of different aliphatic C-H rich substances ( d), F-HCARS signals cover the area of organic fluorescence revealing CBGA and/or a complex mixture of different aliphatic C-H-rich substances is almost exclusively localised inside the disk cells ( e). Scale bars 50 μm ( a and b); Scale bar 10 μm ( c- e) </p>
