  <p class="p">Hierarchical clustering of F-HCARS endmember spectra of reference substances and of glandular trichomes of 
   <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> var. Bedrobinol (two samples) and 
   <italic class="italic">C. sativa</italic> var. Fedora (two samples). Spectral similarity determined by HCA is shown in the dendrogram (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>), the spectra for reference substances and endmembers are compared (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) and the corresponding relative abundance maps (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) are presented. Groups connected by coloured lines denote high spectral similarity. Spectra of reference substances, which show no similarity to spectra of glandular trichomes are denoted by grey lines. The data were named according to the sample type (B = Bedrobinol; F = Fedora) and localisation (Cav = secretory cavity; disk = disk cells). Abbreviations according to Fig.
