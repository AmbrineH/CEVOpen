 <p> Hierarchical clustering of F-HCARS endmember spectra of reference substances and of glandular trichomes of C. sativa var. Bedrobinol (two samples) and C. sativa var. Fedora (two samples). Spectral similarity determined by HCA is shown in the dendrogram ( c), the spectra for reference substances and endmembers are compared ( b) and the corresponding relative abundance maps ( a) are presented. Groups connected by coloured lines denote high spectral similarity. Spectra of reference substances, which show no similarity to spectra of glandular trichomes are denoted by grey lines. The data were named according to the sample type (B = Bedrobinol; F = Fedora) and localisation (Cav = secretory cavity; disk = disk cells). Abbreviations according to Fig. 1 </p>
