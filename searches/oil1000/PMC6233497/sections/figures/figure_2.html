 <p> Illustration of single-photon and two-photon fluorescence, Rayleigh and Raman scattering and CARS. Fluorescence ( a and b): Absorption of light at a frequency ω i excites the molecule to a higher electronic energy level. The molecule can revert to the electronic ground state by non-radiative transitions and the emission of fluorescence at frequency ω f, which is lower than ω i (red-shifted). In two-photon fluorescence ( b) the molecule is simultaneously excited by two photons of approximately half the energy necessary for one-photon excitation (ω i/2). The resulting two-photon fluorescence signal is blue-shifted compared to the incident light. Light scattering ( c): Light at a frequency ω i excites a molecule to a virtual state. The molecule can revert to the ground state by elastic light scattering (Rayleigh scattering) or inelastic scattering with an energy loss at frequency ω s (Stokes Raman scattering) or energy gain at frequency ω as (anti-Stokes Raman scattering). CARS ( d): The CARS process is driven by three photons from at least two different laser sources. A pump beam at frequency ω p excites a molecule from the ground state to a virtual state, which subsequently is depopulated by a Stokes beam at frequency ω s. The last photon from the probe beam ω pr excites the molecule to a higher virtual state. In our setup the pump and probe photon are provided by the same laser at ω p. The resulting signal at frequency ω as is blue-shifted compared to the incident laser light and – if the conditions are met – coherently amplified [ 31] </p>
