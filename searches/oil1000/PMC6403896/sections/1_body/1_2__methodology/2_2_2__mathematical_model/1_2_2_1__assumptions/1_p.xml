  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Only oil and water phases were present, and there was no mass exchange between them.</p>

   <p class="p">The flow process was isothermal and the flow followed Darcyâ€™s law.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The fluids were compressible, and the rock was compressible and anisotropic.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Polymer components were only divided into high and low molecular weight polymer components. The viscosity of the polymer solution was determined by the high molecular weight polymer component, and the virgin polymer solution only had the high molecular weight polymer component.</p>
