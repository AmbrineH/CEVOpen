<p class="p">Equations (24)–(27) constitute a system of nonlinear equations. To ensure the stability of computation, the full implicit method was applied to solve the nonlinear equations. For the solution of each specific time step, the Newton-Raphson method, an iterative method, was used. The solution flow chart is shown in
