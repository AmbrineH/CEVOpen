  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Experimental devices were connected according to the schematic.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The temperature of the thermotank was set to 45 Â°C, and the cores were saturated with water for 24 h.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The water in the cores was displaced by the oil sample at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min. The displacing flow rate was increased to 0.5 mL/min when the water cut at the outlet was lower than 2%, until the volume of the injected oil sample reached 10 times the PV of the cores, and no water was produced. Then, the constant flow pump was stopped, and this condition was maintained for 24 h.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The polymer solution was used to displace at a constant flow rate of 0.64 mL/min until the volume of the injected polymer solution reached 0.64 PV. Then, the constant flow pump was stopped after the polymer flooding, and this condition was maintained for 120 days.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Water was sequentially used to displace at a constant flow rate of 0.64 mL/min until the volume of the injected water reached 4.16 PV. After the subsequent water flooding, the constant flow pump was stopped.</p>
