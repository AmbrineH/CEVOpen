<p class="p">The polymer dynamic degradation experiment was more complicated than a polymer static degradation experiment due to flowing. A schematic of the polymer dynamic degradation experiment is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, and its experimental procedure was: 
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Sands were screened by a 120-mesh screen soaked with the prepared polymer solution for 2 days to complete polymer adsorption in a thermotank at a temperature of 45 °C to avoid the effect of polymer adsorption in the experiment.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Experimental devices were connected according to the schematic, and the temperature of the thermotank was maintained at 45 °C.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Deoxygenation of the entire system was conducted by filling the system with nitrogen gas to avoid the effect of oxygen.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">A circulating pump was used to create the polymer solution flow through the sand layer at a flow rate of 1 m/day. Then 20 mL of the polymer solution was removed as a sample on day 1, 5, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120, and its viscosity was measured at 45 °C. Avoiding oxygen in the sampling process also required careful handling.</p>
