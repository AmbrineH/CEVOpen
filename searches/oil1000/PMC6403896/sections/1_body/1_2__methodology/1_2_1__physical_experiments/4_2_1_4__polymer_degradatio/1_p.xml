<p class="p">The polymer degradation experiments included polymer static and dynamic degradation experiments. The procedure for a polymer static degradation experiment was as follows:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">After deoxidization, the prepared polymer solution with a concentration of 1500 mg/L was sealed in a stainless-steel tank like that used in the following polymer dynamic degradation experiment, and statically placed in a thermotank at a temperature of 45 °C.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">20 mL of the polymer solution was sampled after 1, 5, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 days, and its viscosity was measured at 45 °C. Notably, that oxygen was prevented from entering during the sampling process.</p>
