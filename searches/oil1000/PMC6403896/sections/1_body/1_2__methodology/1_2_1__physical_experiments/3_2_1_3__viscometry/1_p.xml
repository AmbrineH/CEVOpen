<p class="p">After preparing the polymer solution, the viscometric experiments were conducted on a Physica MCR301 advanced rotary rheometer from Anton Paar. The viscosity of the polymer solution with different concentrations was measured at a shear rate of 6.7 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and the viscosity of the polymer solution with a concentration of 1500 mg/L was measured at different shear rates at 45 °C.
