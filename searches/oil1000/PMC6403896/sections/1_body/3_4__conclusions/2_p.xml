<p class="p">Some methods have been proposed to minimize the effect of the HPAM degradation on polymer flooding [

 <xref rid="B56-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. A reduction in HPAM degradation should be ensured to increase polymer flooding efficiency. In addition to the methods used for reducing degradation, some polymers with low and even negative degradation rate constants in the model, whose viscosity slowly decreases and even increases during degradation, have been also proposed for use in polymer flooding to increase oil recovery, such as Xanthan gum, Scleroglucan, Schizophyllan, and cellulose nanocrystals [

 <xref rid="B60-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. In the future, we will focus on experiments on these polymers and incorporate their features into our designed simulator.
