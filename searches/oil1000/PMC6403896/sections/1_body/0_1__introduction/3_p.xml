<p class="p">Most of the above studies were well performed, but the research on polymer degradation is limited. This is a pressing need that must be addressed because polymer degradation can cause a polymer solution to decrease in viscosity, resulting in an increase in the water-oil mobility ratio [
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This ratio is one of the key factors to successful polymer flooding. Many researchers investigated polymer degradation under static conditions or conditions different from reservoir conditions [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. These experimental results cannot accurately describe polymer degradation during polymer flooding, especially when a polymer solution flows in reservoirs. This limitation is unlikely to yield correct results. Therefore, more detailed and accurate polymer degradation experiments must be designed.
