<p class="p">Polymers are essential and ubiquitous in our daily life due to their broad range of properties [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. They have been widely applied in the chemical, construction, agriculture, transportation, communications, aerospace, and medicine fields [
 <xref rid="B2-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,

 <xref rid="B5-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Polymers have played a particularly significant role, especially in the chemical industry [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Polymer flooding enhances oil recovery by reducing the water-oil mobility ratio [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and this advanced technology has been used in oilfields since the 1950s [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The successful application of polymer flooding in the development of Chinese oilfields has alleviated the pressure to find more domestic oil and has helped meet the crude oil demand to a certain extent [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Therefore, polymer flooding is increasingly attracting attention, and its range of application is also growing [
