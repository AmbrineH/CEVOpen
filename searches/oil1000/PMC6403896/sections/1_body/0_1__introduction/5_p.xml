<p class="p">In this paper, physical experiments were performed to investigate the fundamental physicochemical properties of polymers, including viscosity and degradation performance. The viscosities of polymer solutions with different polymer concentrations were measured to estimate the increasing capacity of polymer viscosities. Moreover, the viscosity of a polymer solution with the same polymer concentration was measured at different shear rates. According to the two states of a polymer solution in a reservoir, non-flowing and flowing polymer solutions, the corresponding polymer static and dynamic experiments were designed. Notably, novel polymer dynamic degradation experiments were able to reproduce the condition of a polymer solution flowing in a reservoir, so the results were more accurate. In addition to the physical experiments, a new numerical method is proposed, and an in-house 3D two-phase polymer flooding simulator was designed to consider polymer degradation, where polymer static and dynamic degradations can be specifically identified. The validation of the designed simulator was conducted by comparing the simulation results run in the ECLIPSE V2013.1 software (Houston, TX, USA) and the results from the polymer flooding experiments. While considering polymer degradation, simulations were undertaken by applying the designed simulator to investigate the effect of polymer degradation on production indicators, including a pressure difference, water cut, and oil recovery. These results can assist investigations of polymer degradation effects on polymer flooding in heterogeneous reservoirs.</p>
