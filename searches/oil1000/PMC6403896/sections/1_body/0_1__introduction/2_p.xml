<p class="p">Many researchers have conducted studies on the physicochemical properties of polymer to increase the efficiency of polymer flooding. These researchers have focused on the following five properties: (1) Viscosity. The viscosity of a polymer solution is determined by many factors, such as polymer concentration, polymer degradation, temperature, and the salinity of the water used in solution preparation [

 <xref rid="B12-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. (2) Rheological properties. Unlike a Newtonian fluid, a polymer solution often exhibits shear thinning performance within a certain range of shear rates [

 <xref rid="B14-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. (3) Inaccessible pore volumes (IPVs). Polymer is a molecular group with a certain hydraulic radius that cannot enter certain small pores during polymer flooding, resulting in an IPV [
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], which affects the polymer flow in porous media. Polymer flow is influenced by permeability and polymer molecular weights [

In the process of polymer flooding, polymer inevitably undergoes adsorption in reservoirs due to its properties, surface properties of rock, and mineral composition, with adsorption rates that are affected by temperature and concentration [

 <xref rid="B20-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], and its magnitude depends on temperature, oxygen content, a shear rate, and other factors [
