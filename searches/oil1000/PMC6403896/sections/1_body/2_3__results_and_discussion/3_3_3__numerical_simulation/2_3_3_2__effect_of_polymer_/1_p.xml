<p class="p">To analyze the effect of polymer degradation on production indicators, four more simulations were completed considering the first-order dynamic degradation rate constants of 0.001, 0.002, 0.010, and 0.100 day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The rest of the parameters were the same as those used in the validation case without polymer degradation. A similar method can be used to investigate the effect of polymer static degradation or both polymer static and dynamic degradations on production indicators, not conducted here because the polymer dynamic degradation occupied a dominant position or was even the only type of polymer degradation in typical polymer flooding. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f015" class="xref">Figure 15</xref> provides the comparative results of the production indicators at different first-order dynamic degradation rate constants. This figure indicates that the higher first-order dynamic degradation rate constant can more significantly impact on the production indicators. The reduction in production indicators caused by different first-order dynamic degradation rate constants, after a cumulative injection volume of 1.67 PV, is shown in 
 <xref rid="polymers-10-00857-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>. Notably, the oil recovery, one of the most critical production indicators, decreased 7.7% after a cumulative injection volume of 1.67 PV.

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f016" class="xref">Figure 16</xref>a,b, the severe polymer degradation is obvious. After comparing

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>b, we observed that the polymer leading edge in the simulation, with a first-order dynamic degradation rate constant of 0.100 day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, was faster than that in the simulation without polymer degradation. The reason for this result is that a reduction in the polymer solution viscosity caused by polymer degradation led to an increase in the water-oil mobility ratio [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], resulting in the faster polymer leading edge.

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Compared with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>b, the remaining oil saturation of the simulation, with a first-order dynamic degradation rate constant of 0.100 day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, was more than that of the simulation without considering polymer degradation. This result was also due to the reduction in the polymer solution viscosity caused by the polymer degradation, which led to the increase in the water-oil mobility ratio, resulting in unsatisfactory polymer flooding efficiency and more oil remaining in the reservoir.
