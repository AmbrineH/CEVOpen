<p class="p">Some parameters, including the reservoir properties, fluid properties, relative permeabilities, and initial conditions, were the same as those in the case for validation without polymer degradation, not repeatedly presented here. The different parameters for the experimental simulation from the validation case without polymer degradation are provided in 
 <xref rid="polymers-10-00857-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. The comparative results of the pressure difference, oil production, water production, water cut, cumulative oil production, and oil recovery are indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>. This figure reveals that the simulation result was close to the experimental result. There were differences of 1.00% in water cut and 1.70% in oil recovery after a cumulative injection volume of 1.67 PV, and differences of only 0.08% in water cut and 2.07% in oil recovery were recorded when a 4.8 PV cumulative injection volume was used. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref> illustrates the 3D high molecular weight, low molecular weight, and total polymer concentration distributions after injection of 0.64 PV polymer solution, and at 120 days after injection of 0.64 PV polymer solution by the designed simulator. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref> shows that the high molecular weight polymer concentration decreased, which means that the high molecular weight polymer degraded. The high and low molecular weight polymer concentrations near the injection well were about 1499.50 mg/L and 0.50 mg/L, respectively, after injection of 0.64 PV polymer solution because the dynamic degradation time of the high molecular weight polymer was only 0.175 days, which is a very short time. Then, the high molecular weight polymer concentration near the injection well decreased to about 1218 mg/L, and the low molecular weight polymer concentration near the injection well increased to about 282 mg/L at 120 days after injection of 0.64 PV polymer solution. The average first-order degradation rate constant was about 0.0017 day
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup>, which is close to the first-order static degradation rate constant. This value agreed well with the fact that the polymer static degradation was dominant before the beginning of the subsequent water flooding in the polymer flooding experiment. It proved that the polymer static and dynamic degradation were described well in the designed simulator. Moreover, the total polymer concentration near the injection well remained at nearly 1500 mg/L during the 120 days. This demonstrated that the polymer degradation did not cause a change in the total polymer concentration, which is consistent with polymer theory. Additionally, the actual oil saturation distributions of each layer were examined by the saturation detector after the 0.64 PV polymer solution was injected in the experiment, as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-10-00857-f014" class="xref">Figure 14</xref>b presents the oil saturation distribution obtained with the designed simulator. Some tiny differences were observed between the simulations, by comparing these two oil saturation distributions, which can mainly be attributed to the accuracy of the saturation detector, which was limited by laboratory conditions and influenced by the position and number of probes and experimental operations. Nevertheless, from the data obtained for the oil saturation distributions and the change trends in the oil saturation, the results can be also considered similar. Overall, the validation performed with polymer degradation including polymer static and dynamic degradations was positive and acceptable.
