<p class="p">The simulation results obtained with the ECLIPSE V2013.1 (ECL) software were used as a comparison with our designed simulator (DS) to validate the method without polymer degradation because it is a recognized commercial numerical reservoir simulator, and its simulation results are authoritative [

Clearly, the simulation results were very close, and the difference for each production indicator was less than 0.2%.

From the overall polymer concentration distribution and remaining oil saturation distribution data, the results of both the ECLIPSE V2013.1 software and our designed simulator were also similar. Thus, the validation of the designed simulator without polymer degradation was confirmed, demonstrating both high accuracy and reliability.
