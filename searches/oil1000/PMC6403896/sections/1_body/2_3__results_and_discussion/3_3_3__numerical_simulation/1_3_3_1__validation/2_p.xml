<p class="p">However, no widely accepted commercial software considers polymer degradation [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-10-00857" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], and conducting simulations with consideration of both polymer static and dynamic degradation was not possible. Therefore, we compared the simulation results of our designed simulator with the data of an actual polymer flooding experiment for validation, where both polymer static and dynamic degradation were considered.
