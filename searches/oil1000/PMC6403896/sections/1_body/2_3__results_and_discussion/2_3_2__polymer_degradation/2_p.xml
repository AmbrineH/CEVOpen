<p class="p">The viscosity of the polymer solution decreased with increasing time. The viscosity of the polymer at 120 days was about three-fifths or 60% of the virgin polymer solution during polymer static degradation, and the viscosity of the polymer at 120 days was approximately half that of the virgin polymer solution during polymer dynamic degradation. The main reason for this finding is that the long molecular polymer chains break down in the process of polymer degradation, and the length of average molecular chains is cut along with the average molecular weight of polymer, which leads to a decrease in the viscosity of the polymer solution [

Combining the polymer viscometric experiment and the polymer degradation experiment results, the first-order static and dynamic degradation rate constants can be calculated. Compared with the first-order static degradation rate constant of 0.0017 day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the first-order dynamic degradation rate constant was 0.0022 day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which was greater than the first-order static degradation rate constant. This occurred because the additional shear stress led to additional chain ruptures as the polymer solution flowed through the sands, resulting in a decrease in the viscosity of the polymer solution and an increase in the polymer degradation rate [
