 <p> Response surface plots show the effect of time (min), moisture (%) and microwave power (W) on the extraction yield (%) ( a) the yield values increased as time and power increased; ( b) the yield values increased the extraction time in combination with moisture; ( c) The yield values increased when low moisture and high power were tested. </p>
