<p class="p">GC/MS was accomplished by a model GC/MS-QP2010 instrument (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with an RTX-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter). The carrier gas was helium, the flow rate was 1 mL/min, the injection volume was 1.0 µL, and the injector temperature was set at 200 °C. The temperature was initially increased at 3 °C/min until it reached 240 °C, then at 10 °C/min to 280 °C, where it was maintained for 10 min. The volatile oil constituents were identified by reference to the NIST 11 Mass Spectral Library (NIST11/2011/EPA/NIH) and by comparing their retention indices (RIs) with authentic mass spectra [
