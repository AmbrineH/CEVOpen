<p class="p">A 2
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> full-factorial design with center point was used to evaluate the main effects and interactions of the following variables: time (min), moisture (%) and microwave power (W) on response variable extraction yield (%). In this case, the percentage of water added in the powder material for the extraction, followed the amount determined by the experimental design. The choice of the parameters and their levels was based on the previous experimental studies. A total number of 13 runs of experiment including eight experiments of 2
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> full-factorial design and five replicates at the center point were carried out. The independent variables and their levels are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00651-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. All the experiments were carried out at random, in order to minimize the effect of unexplained variability in the observed responses due to systematic errors.
