<p class="p">The sum of penalty points for the whole procedure should be included in the Eco-Scale calculation, according to the following formula [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], Analytical Eco-Scale = 100 − (total penalty points). The calculation result is ranked on a scale where a score &gt;75 represents excellent green analysis, &gt;50 represents acceptable green analysis, and &lt;50 represents inadequate green analysis [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The basis for our concept of an analytical eco-scale is that the ideal green analysis has a value of 100. Recently, in organic synthesis the concept of eco-scale values has emerged as more accurate tool for evaluating the “ecofriendliness” of a given process, estimating the quality of the organic preparation based on yield, cost, safety, conditions, and ease of workup/purification. This can also be applied to the natural product field.
