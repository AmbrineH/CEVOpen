<p class="p">The microwave-assisted extraction of volatile oil of 30 g of 
 <italic class="italic">P. emarginatus</italic> fruits in 13.2 mL of water under the optimal established conditions, 39 min, 44% humidity and 280 W, yield 1.73 mL of the volatile oil, 5.76% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>). Conventional extraction was performed using the same reaction conditions as used in MAE (X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> = 39 min, X

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> = 280 W) but without the microwave irradiation 0.44% (

 <italic class="italic">P. emarginatus</italic> in 500 mL of distilled water during 4 h yield 3.60 (%

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of volatile oil. The results (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00651-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) confirm the efficacy of MAE to extract volatile oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. emarginatus</italic> fruits. Optimize MAE yielded more than ten times the quantity of oil that conventional extraction (CE) (5.76 versus 0.44% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) in 39 min and almost 2 times more oil than CE in 4 h.
