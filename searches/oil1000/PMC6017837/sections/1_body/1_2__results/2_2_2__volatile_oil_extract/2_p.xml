 <italic class="italic">P. emarginatus</italic> fruits led to the reduction of the quantity of solvent and the reduction of the extraction time. The extraction under conventional conditions requires 10 mL of water per gram of biomass while using the optimize conditions for MAE only 0.4 mL are needed. The reduction of the extraction time results in the reduction of the energy input. Under conventional heating were consumed 2.6 kW/h to obtained 1.73 mL of volatile oil from 50 g biomass and under microwave irradiation were consumed 0.1 kW/h per 30 g of biomass to obtained 1.80 mL of volatile oil. Therefore, using the optimized MAE the energy input was reduced from 5.33 to 0.11 kJ/g. The reduction of the extraction time and the energy input approach the method of the sustainability requirements that is also illustrated by the increase of the analytical Eco-scale from 86 to 89 being closer of 100, to the optimal value for green analysis [
