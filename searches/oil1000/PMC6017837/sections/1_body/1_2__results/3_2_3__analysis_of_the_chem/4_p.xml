<p class="p">The GC/MS analysis was determined on the volatile oil obtained under the optimised oil extraction conditions and under conventional conditions. All the constituents identified were sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons. The main component of the volatile oil is γ-muurolene with 48.03 and 47.31% in MAE volatile oil and CE, respectively. However, the chemical composition presents significant differences with the type of extraction. Caryophyllene (25.65%) and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-α-bisabolol (6.24%) were identified as major components in MAE sample while caryophyllene (6.75%) and γ-elemene (7.02%) are the components with higher relative percentage and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-α-bisabolol is not detectable in CE samples (
