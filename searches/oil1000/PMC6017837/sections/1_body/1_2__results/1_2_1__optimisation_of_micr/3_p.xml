 <xref rid="molecules-23-00651-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> results indicate that the variables with the largest effects on extraction yield were the linear terms, time (X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) and power (X
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), followed by the quadratic term, time (X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the interaction between moisture and power (X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>.X
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>). The linear term, moisture (X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and the interaction between the time and power (X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>.X
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) were also significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The ANOVA showed that lack-of-fit was not significant for the model at 95% confidence interval (CI) (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05), confirming that the model satisfactorily represented the data. Also, the
