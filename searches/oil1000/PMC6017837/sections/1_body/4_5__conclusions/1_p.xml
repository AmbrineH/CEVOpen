<p class="p">The microwave assisted-extraction has been shown to be feasible with particular interest in avoiding the need for organic solvents in volatile oil extraction from plants. In this work we proof that a minimum amount of water could be enough to bring good result in extraction. This green methodology appears to be an excellent alternative for obtaining terpenes from aromatic plants for academic purposes, as well as pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food fields.</p>
