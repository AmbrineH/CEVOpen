<p class="p">In this context, a recent technology namely microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) has been broadly used to extract various natural components from plants [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The MAE for the extraction of oils from natural substrates has been established as an alternative to conventional heating because it allows the decrease of the extraction time, the decrease of the volume solvent and the decrease of the amount of biomass needed by increasing the extraction yield [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The superior performance of microwave irradiation in these extraction processes could be related with the interaction of irradiation and water, microwave releases the essential oil and in situ water is transferred from the inside to the outside of the plant material [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The extraction efficiency can be affected by several properties such as the characteristics of the plant material, power level, duration of microwave irradiation, type and volume of solvent used, the ratio biomass/solvent, the size of the coupled distillation system and the vial format used for the extraction therefore the rational optimization of the microwave-assisted extraction is essential to achieve higher efficiencies. Considering the various biological activities associated with 
 <italic class="italic">P. emarginatus</italic> constituents and other botanical species, the design of green and sustainable extraction methods and characterization of the essential oils derived from these plants is an important and trending area of research aimed at sourcing natural bioactive compounds. Here we report the optimisation of the microwave assisted extraction (MAE) with experimental design of volatile oil from the fruit of
