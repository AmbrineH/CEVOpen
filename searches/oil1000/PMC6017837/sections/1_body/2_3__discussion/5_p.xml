<p class="p">Also, future studies that identify the bioactive properties of the main constituents separately from the essential oil and their mechanism of action are encouraged. MAE can be considered a suitable replacement for CE, requiring less biomass for higher essential oil yield, significantly less extraction time, energy use, CO

Furthermore, the MAE technique can be used to obtain secondary metabolites from other medicinal plants and, therefore, represents an important biotechnological advancement. The variables of the equipment (power, temperature, pressure and time), offer a range of possibilities that should vary per the extraction kinetics of each biomass. Finally, the characteristic of studies of microwave-assisted extraction, which stands out in technology is the reduction in the duration in time (14 times than conventional method), energy (six times than conventional method) and reagents/solvents.
