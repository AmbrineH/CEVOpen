<p class="p">This study used a fully adapted microwave distillation device intended only for extractions by Clevenger apparatus. This proof-of-principle study was demonstrated using a small quantity of plant material. Therefore, further tests should investigate the relative efficiency of this MAE approach using a greater amount of biomass than used in the present study.</p>
