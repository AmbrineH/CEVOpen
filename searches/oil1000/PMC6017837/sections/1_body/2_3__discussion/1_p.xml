 <italic class="italic">P. emarginatus</italic> fruits by MAE compared to CE. Nevertheless, the extraction itself derived from the experimental design had variation in yield results, which can be related not only to the amount of biomass and the extraction time but the way of pressing the fruits. For this work we used knives mill crusher type to obtain fruit powder sample. The more biomass is formed more efficient will be the volatile oil yield extraction. This is also true for the method by microwave irradiation [
