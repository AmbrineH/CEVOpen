<p class="p">The EO samples were clearly separated into two groups. A separation of the EO samples is clearly shown along principal component 2 (PC2). EO extracted from oregano cultivated in 100% manure and vegetable compost soils, as well as non-sterilized and non-inoculated soils were distributed in a group with relatively higher proportion of thymol as a principal constituent marking thymol chemotype. The EO samples obtained from nursery mixture soil, potting mix and professional agriculture mixture, sterilized-non inoculated soil, non-sterilized-inoculated soil, and sterilized-inoculated soil were characterized by the chemotype: thymol/carvacrol. PCA highlighted the existence of two different chemotypes in 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> EO study samples, proving the existence of chemical variability: thymol and thymol/carvacrol.
