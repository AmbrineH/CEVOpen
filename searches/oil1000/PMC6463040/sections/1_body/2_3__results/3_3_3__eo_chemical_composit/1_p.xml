<p class="p">In total, 35 components were identified in the volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> plants cultivated in 9 different types of soil and representing 90.7–98.4% of the total oil composition. 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00090-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> gathers the composition of the EO of the nine samples of oregano collected. The compounds were grouped into five classes: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, and others. Monoterpenes, both monoterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated monoterpenes were the most highly represented classes. The main components were: αp-cymene (4.2–14.8%), γ-terpinene (1.5–10.6%), thymol (37.8–56.3%), carvacrol (10.3–35.8%), and β-caryophyllene (1.2–2.1%) (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00090-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Our results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> EO obtained from all soil types were distinguished by the levels of thymol and carvacrol. Indeed, high levels of thymol were identified in manure and vegetable compost soils (soils A and D), as well as non-sterilized and non-inoculated (NSNI) EO samples, whereas the EO samples obtained on nursery mixture soil (soil E), potting mix and professional agriculture mixture (soils B and C), sterilized-non inoculated (SNI), non-sterilized inoculated (NSI), and sterilized inoculated (SI) soils contained high levels of thymol and carvacrol.
