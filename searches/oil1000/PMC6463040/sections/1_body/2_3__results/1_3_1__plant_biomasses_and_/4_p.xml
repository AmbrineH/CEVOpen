 <italic class="italic">Origanum syriacum</italic> root samples obtained from all soil types revealed the presence of AMF structures: arbuscules, vesicles, and intraradical hyphae. Total root mycorrhizal rates were about 51% and 23% for inoculated oregano cultivated respectively on non-sterilized and sterilized soils (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00090-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). No AMF colonization was observed in the absence of inoculation on sterilized soil, while root colonization rate was about 17% on the non-inoculated and non-sterilized soils.
