<p class="p">On the other hand, the root biomasses obtained on non-sterilized soil were 0.83 and 0.85 g for non-inoculated and inoculated conditions, respectively. Besides, root biomasses obtained on sterilized soils were 0.65 g and 0.80 g for non-inoculated and inoculated conditions, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the root dry weight of inoculated and non-inoculated plants grown in sterilized or non-sterilized soils (Fisherâ€™s least significant difference (LSD) test:
