<p class="p">Our results showed that the yield of extracted EO ranged from 0.1% to 4.1% in all tested soil types. These findings are in agreement with those found in the literature [

 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> cultivated in different types of soil could be related to the interaction between edaphic factors, nutrient availability and mycorrhizal inoculation. Indeed, organic matter, water balance, and mineral rate (P and N) are known to promote EO yields of medicinal plants [
