<p class="p">After 16 weeks of culture, fresh shoot biomasses were measured and only foliar biomasses were directly used for EO extraction. Moreover, roots obtained on non-sterilized inoculated (NSI), non-sterilized and non-inoculated (NSNI), sterilized and inoculated (SI), and sterilized and non-inoculated (SNI) soils were rinsed and lyophilized prior measurement of their biomasses. Some of them were used for root colonization rate analysis and the rest was stored at 4 °C. In order to determine arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of oregano plants, the roots were coloured by Trypan blue as described in [
