<p class="p">EO composition was determined by gas chromatography (Thermo Electron Corporation apparatus equipped with flame ionization detector) using a non-polar HP-5MS (5% phenyl methyl siloxane) capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.25 μm, (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrish, Darmstadt, Germany)) or a polar fused-silica HP Innowax capillary column (polyethylene glycol, 50-m length, 0.20-mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.20 μm, (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrish)). The oven temperature followed a gradient rising from 35 to 85 °C at 5 °C/min, held isothermal at 85 °C for 20 min, then rising from 85 to 300 °C at 10 °C/min, and finally held isothermal at 300 °C for 5 min; the injector temperature was 250 °C and detector temperature 310 °C. The carrier gas was He at a rate of 0.8 mL/min. Aliquots of 1 μL of diluted samples (1/100,
