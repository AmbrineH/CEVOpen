<p class="p">In order to confirm the identification of the components, GC/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent, Beijing, China) coupled with an Agilent 5975 mass-selective detector and equipped with an Agilent 7683 B auto sampler (injection of 1 μL of oil for each sample). The capillary columns and the GC conditions were as described above (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4dot1-foods-08-00090" class="xref">Section 2.4.1</xref>); Ion Source 18 and Transfer line temperatures were 310 °C and 320 °C, respectively. The mass spectrometer was in electron ionization mode at 70 eV and the mass range was: 50–400 amu (full scan mode).
