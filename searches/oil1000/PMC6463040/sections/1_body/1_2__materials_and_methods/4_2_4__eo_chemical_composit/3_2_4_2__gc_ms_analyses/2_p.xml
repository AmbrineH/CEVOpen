<p class="p">Identification and Quantification of Essential-Oil Components and Alkanes: an n-alkane (C8–C40) mixture was analysed under the same experimental GC/MS conditions to calculate the Kovats indexes (KI). Identification of individual EO components was based on comparison of their retention indices (RI), on both polar and non-polar columns, relative to the retention times (Rt) of the series of n-alkanes (C8–C40) with those of standard compounds obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany) or with those of the literature as described by [

 <xref rid="B28-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Further identification was made by comparison of their mass spectra on both columns with those listed in the commercial mass spectral libraries of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and Wiley 275 computer libraries, our home-made library constructed with pure compounds, or with published mass spectra as described by [

 <xref rid="B29-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], allowing a reliable confirmation of the identity of each component. Standards of some EO of known composition (such as the EO of
