 <italic class="italic">Origanum syriacum</italic>, known as “zaatar” or “zoubaa” in Lebanon, is one of the most popular herbs used in traditional Lebanese medicine and largely used in the famous Lebanese pizza “mankouchi”. It is an aromatic plant species belonging to the Lamiaceae family. Overharvesting, urbanization pressure, and uncontrolled forest fires threaten 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> growing wild. For this reason it is now being cultivated to reduce the overexploitation of the spontaneous forms [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, sabinene hydrate, and γ- terpinene were identified as major constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> EO [

 <xref rid="B13-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], known for their antibacterial and antifungal activities, antispasmodic and radical scavenging effects, acetylcholine esterase and lipid peroxidase inhibition, white blood cell macrophage stimulation, and cardiac depressant activity [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Altitude, region, time of harvest, and plant part influence the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> EO [

 <xref rid="B20-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, the effect of soil type on the EO chemotype is less studied. To the best of our knowledge, no articles dealing with the variation of 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> EO chemical composition according to soil type have been published to date. Therefore, the main purpose of this work was to investigate the variability of 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> EO chemical composition with respect to soil type. 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> plants were cultivated in different soil types including manure, potting mix, professional agriculture mixture, vegetable compost, nursery soils, and natural agricultural soil inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In fact, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) occur in the soil of most ecosystems. These symbiotic fungi enhance the nutritional state and water uptake of their hosts and increase disease resistance and plant health [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Besides, AMF may enhance EO yield and enhance the contents of some secondary metabolites of medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. A better understanding of the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on EO chemical composition may shed light on the behaviour of plant species associated with AMF. Basic knowledge about the impact of edaphic conditions on EO chemical composition has proven to be of crucial importance for determining the optimal type of soil, leading to good quality herb production adapted to the user’s needs.
