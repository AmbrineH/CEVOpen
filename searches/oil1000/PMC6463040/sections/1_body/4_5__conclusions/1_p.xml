<p class="p">Results presented herein revealed that chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum syriacum</italic> EO could be affected by soil type as well as by the presence of mycorrhizal inoculation. Indeed, manure and vegetable compost soils increased thymol synthesis, whereas potting mix, professional agriculture mixture, and nursery mixture soils were of the thymol/carvacrol chemotype. Besides, the AMF symbiosis promoted carvacrol synthesis and decreased the concentration of thymol. Therefore, this study contributes to present data for 
 <italic class="italic">O. syriacum</italic> cultivation, establishes parameters to essential oil components, and responds to the needs of the users in order to provide a high economic return. Further assays should be conducted in order to improve the quantity and quality of the EO obtained on tested soil types, by searching for appropriate AMF species, oregano variety, and soil type composition.
