 <p> (Left) David Deamer added a “prebiotic soup” to a boiling pool in the Dachnoye thermal field on Mount Mutnovsky, and (right) points to the white froth of fatty acid membranes that immediately appeared around the edges. The pool was sampled over time and later analyzed. Surprisingly, all of the added solutes except the fatty acid were bound to the clay minerals, an observation that has implications for the fate of organic compounds in similar settings on the prebiotic Earth. </p>
