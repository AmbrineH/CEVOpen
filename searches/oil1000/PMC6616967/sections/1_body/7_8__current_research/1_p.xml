<p class="p">All life requires liquid water, and presumably life began in liquid water. This means that the ionic composition of hydrothermal water is significant if we are to understand the origin of life. The reason is that the major compounds associated with life processes are typically ionic solutes having carboxylate, phosphate, and amine groups, and the chemical properties of these groups are strongly affected by the hydrogen ion and divalent cation concentrations. An obvious example is availability of phosphate, which is essential to life. At alkaline pH ranges of 8 and above, and in the presence of calcium, mineral apatite precipitates and removes phosphate from solution, but at acidic pH ranges phosphate is soluble even in the presence of calcium. Another example is the inhibitory effect of divalent cations on the ability of long chain monocarboxylic acids to assemble into membranes.</p>
