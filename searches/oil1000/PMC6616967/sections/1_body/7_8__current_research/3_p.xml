<p class="p">Because most of Earthâ€™s liquid water is in the ocean, it has been generally assumed that life began in the ocean, perhaps at hydrothermal vents. However, there is reason to believe that thermodynamic hurdles and divalent cation concentrations inhibit self-assembly of membranes and polymerization reactions required for life to begin [
 <xref rid="B24-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The results of laboratory simulations and fieldwork performed in Kamchatka, Yellowstone Park, and New Zealand suggest that fresh water distilled from seawater and provided as precipitation to volcanic land masses and hot springs may be a more conducive medium for the origin of life.
