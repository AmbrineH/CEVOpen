<p class="p">The results of the Kamchatka exploration represent a good basis for further interdisciplinary research relevant to life’s beginnings, and particularly the role of fluctuating environments [

The author has proposed that oscillating conditions are required for life to emerge, as well as availability of organic matter, an aqueous medium, and a source of chemical energy. A key idea is that self-sustaining life processes were launched by continuous response of prebiotic microsystems to incessant physicochemical oscillations in the environment. Our observations of pressure–temperature oscillations and wet–dry cycles in the hydrothermal systems of Kamchatka have inspired laboratory experiments on prebiotic chemistry [
