<p class="p">The oil in Uzon caldera was first investigated in the 20th century [
 <xref rid="B16-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], but the study carried out by Simoneit, Deamer, and the author provided significant new data [
 <xref rid="B18-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the primary constituents, and the 13C and 14C compositions provided information about the potential source and age of the oils. The 14C age was 1030 ± 40 yrs BP (measured) or 940 ± 40 yrs BP (conventional) which is the youngest hydrothermal petroleum reported to date. The delta 13C value is −30.6‰ versus the PDB standard. This is a clear indication that the oil was formed from biogenic detritus and not by abiotic synthesis from mantle carbon. The biogenic origin was confirmed by the presence of sterane and hopane biomarkers.
