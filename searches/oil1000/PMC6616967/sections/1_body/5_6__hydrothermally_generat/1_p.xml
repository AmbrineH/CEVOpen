<p class="p">Oil seeps in the central part of Uzon caldera were first observed by Russian scientists in the 1960s. The oils are present as water emulsions in porous rocks beneath the thin (5–8 cm) surface bed of clay, usually near hot mud pools and submerged griffons of thermal water. They can also be seen as an oil slick floating on the water surface. Thick layers of volcanic-sedimentary rocks have accumulated in the caldera’s lakes for the last 40,000 years and contain abundant detritus of higher plants and diatoms. Defining the process by which oil is generated takes into consideration an unusual combination of intense volcanic-hydrothermal processes and the host lacustrine basin with sediments rich in buried biological material.</p>
