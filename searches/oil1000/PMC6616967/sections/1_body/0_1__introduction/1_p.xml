<p class="p">About 20 years ago David Deamer and the author initiated an exploration of hydrothermal systems in the Kamchatka peninsula of Eastern Russia as a potential analogue of the prebiotic environment on early Earth. Our first discussion of possible fieldwork in Kamchatka was at the ISSOL conference in San Diego in 1999 and continued a year later during my visit to the University of California, Santa Cruz. We decided to organize two expeditions to Kamchatka hydrothermal sites in 2001 and 2004. I served as the local organizer for both, and for the 2001 trip David invited an American team of astrobiologists including Christopher McKay, Sherry Cady, John Spears, and Jonathan and Suzanne Trent. The second expedition in 2004 included Jamie Elsila and Meaghan Spencer, who were graduate students in Dick Zareâ€™s lab at Stanford, two postdoctoral researchers from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and our photographer, Tony Hoffman (
