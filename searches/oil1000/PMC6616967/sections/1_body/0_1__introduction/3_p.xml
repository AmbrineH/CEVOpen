<p class="p">Over the following ten years David and I stayed in close contact but worked in different geothermal systems. I continued exploration of the hydrothermal settings in Kamchatka together with my Russian colleagues―Valery Poturay, Gennady Karpov, Vladimir Rapoport, and Konstantin Shlufman―while David worked with his colleague Bruce Damer with field trips to Bumpass Hell on Mount Lassen in California, Yellowstone National Park and most recently New Zealand. A major goal of our research in Kamchatka has been to investigate organic matter in hot spring water and to characterize pressure–temperature oscillations in hydrothermal systems of deep boreholes. Recently David Deamer, Bruce Damer, and I integrated the relevant data obtained in Kamchatka and other geothermal regions, along with laboratory experiments, to discuss the connection between hydrothermal chemistry and the origin of cellular life [
