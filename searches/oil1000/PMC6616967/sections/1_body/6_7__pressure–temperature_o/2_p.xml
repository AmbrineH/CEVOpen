<p class="p">Short-term variability of pressure at a depth of 1 km consists of two main components: Regular micro-oscillations having periods of 10â€“20 min and amplitudes up to 1 bar, and irregular macrofluctuations with much longer pressure variations measured in days. The pressure varied between 24.9 and 29.6 bars. We also observed a third component of the pressure dynamics characterized by sudden pressure changes and high frequency fluctuations with periods of less than 5 min. The correlation coefficient between pressure and temperature was estimated from measurements at the wellheads and was highly positive, ranging from 0.89 to 0.99.</p>
