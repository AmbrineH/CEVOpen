 <xref rid="B19-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Such oscillations drive molecular synthesis and recombination and initiate a continuous evolutionary response of prebiotic microsystems to incessant stresses. In this context, several databases on pressure and temperature dynamics in the wells in Mutnovsky hydrothermal system were mathematically processed [
 <xref rid="B20-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The monitoring of the wells was carried out both at the surface and at depth. The minimal interval between the measurements was a few minutes, and two portions of the pressure dynamics over a 25-day period in well no. 30 are shown on
