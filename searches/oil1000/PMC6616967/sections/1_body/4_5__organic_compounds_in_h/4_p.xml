 <xref rid="life-09-00041-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Along with the analyses of volatile and nonvolatile organics, the total number of homologous series detected in the Kamchatka geothermal region is 24, including 243 distinct compounds. Several are prebiotically relevant, including nitrogen-containing compounds (amino acids, nitriles, amides, and nitrogen cycles) and lipid precursors (carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, and aldehydes) [
