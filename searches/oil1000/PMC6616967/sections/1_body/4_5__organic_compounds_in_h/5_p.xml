<p class="p">The organic compounds associated with hydrothermal water have several potential sources. The most obvious is simple degradation of buried biological material, but abiotic synthesis is also a possibility [
 <xref rid="B13-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Most of the compounds are derived from thermophilic microorganisms. A biological source was directly confirmed during the studies of amino acids in several thermal springs by Mukhin et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] and oil droplets in Uzon caldera [
 <xref rid="B16-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, thermogenesis can also occur in local hydrothermal environments. We detected many moderately volatile compounds in the superheated sterile condensate of waterâ€“steam mixture from deep boreholes in Mutnovsky and Pauzhetsky hydrothermal systems [
 <xref rid="B17-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Unlike Uzon caldera, the host rocks in Mutnovsky and Pauzhetsky areas are volcanic, not sedimentary, and do not contain substantial organic material, yet the condensate has short chain n-alkanes presumably generated by thermal geochemical processes. Glycine was also detected but at very low concentrations, less than a microgram per liter [
 <xref rid="B12-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The occurrence of halogenated alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons in the hot springs of the Mutnovsky volcano crater support abiotic thermogenesis because such compounds cannot be synthesized by thermophilic microorganisms.
