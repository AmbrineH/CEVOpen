 <xref rid="B12-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, a large group of moderately volatile organic compounds was virtually unexplored in 2005 when we obtained access to a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S spectrometer. The field sites in 11 hydrothermal systems in Kamchatka were sampled and analyzed, and the results were separated into two groups:
