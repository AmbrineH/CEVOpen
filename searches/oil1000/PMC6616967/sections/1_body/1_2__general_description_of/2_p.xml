<p class="p">Discharges of hydrothermal fluid in Kamchatka are very diverse, including boiling springs, geysers, fumaroles, and water vapor mixed with volcanic gases, such as sulfur dioxide. Seven regions of the Kamchatka peninsula have been explored: Mutnovsky, Uzon, Pauzhetsky, Valley of Geysers, Karymsky, Karymshinsky, and Paratunsky. The most substantial studies were carried out in the hydrothermal systems on Mount Mutnovsky and the Uzon caldera [

The water has pH values ranging from 1.5 to 10, and temperatures from 50 to 99 °C, while the temperature of the water-steam mixture from deep wells can be as high as 240 °C. Pressure may reach 40 bars at well-heads and 80 bars at 1 km depths.
