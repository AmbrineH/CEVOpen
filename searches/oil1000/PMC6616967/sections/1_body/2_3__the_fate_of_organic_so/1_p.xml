<p class="p">On 7 September 2004, a preliminary experiment was performed in which biologically important organic compounds were added to a natural hot pool (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-09-00041-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The experiment was inspired by Charles Darwin’s conjecture that life might have begun in a “warm little pond” so we jokingly referred to the pool as Darwin’s hot little puddle. The pool was approximately 0.7 × 0.7 meters with an estimated volume of 7 liters. The pH was 3.1 and the temperature at the boiling center was 97 °C. The pool was lined with a layer of grey clay mineral several centimeters deep. This was disturbed by the boiling which caused constant stirring and turbidity.
