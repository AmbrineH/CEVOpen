<p class="p">1. The hydrochemical zonality in the Uzon caldera was clarified. Previous researchers reported a change of water composition in the Uzon hydrothermal system from chloride-sodium in the center (just above the magmatic chamber) to sulfate in the intermediate zone and bicarbonate on the flank [
