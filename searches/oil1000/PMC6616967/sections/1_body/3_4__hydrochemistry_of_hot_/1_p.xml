<p class="p">Liquid water is one of the three widely accepted conditions for the origin of life together with a source of energy and organic compounds. Therefore, the ionic composition of hydrothermal water is exceptionally important. The hydrochemistry of hot spring water in Kamchatka has been extensively investigated by geologists from the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology in Petropavlovsk [

However, hydrothermal systems as potential analogues of the prebiotic environment on early Earth still require further exploration. Three aims have been achieved during our research.
