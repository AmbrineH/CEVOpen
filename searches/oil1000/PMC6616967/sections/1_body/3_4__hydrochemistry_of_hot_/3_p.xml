<p class="p">2. The general ratio between concentrations of univalent and divalent cations was characterized. The ratios Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>/K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and Na+/Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> are important for understanding the aqueous conditions related to the origin of life. For instance, Mulkidjanian et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] considered the prevalence of K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> concentration over Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> to be an important feature of aqueous prebiotic environment because K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> dominates the intracellular ionic concentration of cells today. However, in the Kamchatka geothermal region all of the samples analyzed sodium concentrations significantly exceeded those of potassium. This is also true for hot spring water in Yellowstone National Park. According to Milshteyn et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-life-09-00041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], high concentrations of divalent ions such as Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> inhibit self-assembly of lipid vesicles. The concentrations of Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> in Kamchatka hot springs do not usually exceed 2â€“3 mM, a value that is conducive for self-assembly of lipid vesicles.
