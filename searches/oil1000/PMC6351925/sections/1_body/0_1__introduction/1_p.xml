<p class="p">Under nutrition affects millions of people globally, especially in developing countries [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The cause of under nutrition is mainly an inadequate nutrient intake or absorption to cover needs for energy, growth and to maintain a healthy immune body system. Micronutrient deficiencies are a form of undernutrition and occur when the body lacks one or more micronutrients such as iron, iodine, zinc, vitamin A or folate. These deficiencies usually affect growth and immunity but some cause specific clinical conditions such as anaemia (iron deficiency), hypothyroidism (iodine deficiency) or xerophthalmia (vitamin A deficiency). Vitamin A [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and iron deficiencies [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] are the major public health concerns in resource poor communities. Macronutrient deficiencies are also common and usually occur as protein energy malnutrition. The persistent high levels of macro and micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries are attributed to the dependence on plant based foods and lack of nutrient diversity [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Plant based foods are relatively cheaper and can be afforded by most households in developing countries. However, they have a relatively lower protein quality and limited nutrient bioavailability. Inadequate intake of quality protein and micronutrients such as iron and vitamin A [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] might have contributed to the widespread of macro and micronutrient malnutrition manifested in children aged 6–59 months [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Many programs have been implemented to reduce vitamin A, iodine [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and iron deficiencies in developing countries. One of the programs that has been implemented to reduce micronutrient deficiencies is the use of bio-fortified sweet potatoes such as orange fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP) and beans respectively [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Indeed in many areas, OFSP have been used in the formulation of complementary diets due to their high content of naturally bio-available β-carotene [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Studies have indicated that OFSP flour is rich in β-carotene (100–1600 mg RAE/100 g for varieties in Africa) [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], energy (293 to 460 kJ/100 g) [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and significant amounts of iron, zinc and manganese [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Although OFSP and its products may have many positive attributes and is cheaper than other crops, it is limited in other micronutrients such as calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus and quality proteins [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Therefore, OFSP alone cannot be adequate in combating the different types of nutrient deficiencies afflicting the vulnerable communities in developing countries. Thus, there is a need to enhance the macro and micronutrient profile of OFSP using locally available foods. Green leafy vegetables such as amaranth have been documented to contain essential micronutrients such as β-carotene, vitamin C, iron, calcium, zinc and proteins [
