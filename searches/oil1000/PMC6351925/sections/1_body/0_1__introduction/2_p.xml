<p class="p">Amaranth leaves are considered as one of the principal leafy vegetables in tropical areas with high annual production [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Milk protein is the source of all the essential amino acids with high protein digestibility [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Therefore, addition of skimmed milk and amaranth leaves powder to orange fleshed sweet potato flour could be a better option to provide a better overall essential amino acid balance and micronutrients. This could help to overcome the global protein calorie and micronutrient malnutrition challenges respectively. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a nutrient enhanced OFSP-based composite flour incorporating skimmed milk and amaranth leaf powders that is suitable for children aged 6â€“59 months.
