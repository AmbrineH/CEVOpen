<p class="p">The swelling power and solubility of the flours were determined according to the method described by reference [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. About one gram (1 g) of sample was weighed, transferred into a clean dry test tube and added to 50 mL of distilled water. The mixture was vortexed for about 5 min. The resulting slurry was heated at 60 °C for 30 min in a water bath (Grants Instrument Ltd., Shepreth, UK) while shaking the tubes every after 5 min. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 15 min. Supernatant was carefully removed and starch sediment weighed. About 5 mL of aliquot of the supernatant was taken into pre-weighed dish and dried to a constant weight at 120 °C for 4 h. The residue obtained after drying was taken to be the amount of starch solubilized in water. The swelling power and solubility of the sample were expressed as percentages.
