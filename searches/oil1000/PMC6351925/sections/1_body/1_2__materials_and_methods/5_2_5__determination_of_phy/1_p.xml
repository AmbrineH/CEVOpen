<p class="p">The bulk density, water and oil absorption capacities of the OFSP-based composite flours were determined as described by reference [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. About one gram of flour was mixed with 10 mL of distilled water and 10 mL of oil respectively in a test tube and vortexed for about 5 min. The samples were allowed to stand at 30 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min using centrifuge (ThermoFisher scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The volume of supernatant in a graduated cylinder was then noted. Density of water was taken to be 1 g/mL and that of oil to be 0.93 g/mL. The water/oil absorbed (V) was calculated as the difference between the initial water/oil used (V
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) and the volume of the supernatant obtained after centrifuging (V
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>). Thus V= V
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> − V
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and mass = density × volume. The percentage of water/oil absorbed by the flour was expressed on a % basis. For bulk density, approximately 2 g of the flour (m) was gently introduced into a dry 10 mL graduated cylinder without compacting. The cylinder was carefully tapped to compact the sample. The apparent volume (V) was recorded to the nearest graduated unit. The bulk density of flours was expressed as g/mL.
