<p class="p">All experimental determinations were carried out in triplicate and subjected to statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) using XLSTAT software version 2017 (Addinsoft, New York, NY, USA) to determine variation between means of OFSP-based composite flours for their nutrient composition, sensory, physico-chemical and functional properties. A multiple factor analysis (MFA) was run to determine correlation between sensory attributes of porridges from different OFSP-based composite flours. Significance variation was accepted at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The Fisher Least Significant Difference (LSD) test was done to determine the significant difference between the two means of the properties of flours. Experimental results were expressed as the means Â± standard deviations (SD).
