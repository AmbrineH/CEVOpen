<p class="p">The proximate composition of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours were carried out according to AOAC official method for nutrient analysis [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Moisture content was determined by the oven method; protein content was determined by Kjeldahl method (nitrogen content multiplied by 6.25); fat content was determined by using petroleum ether extraction; and crude fiber was determined by digesting defatted samples with diluted acid (1.25%) sulfuric acid solution for 30 min at boiling point followed by digestion with 1.25% sodium hydroxide solution for the same duration. The carbohydrate component was determined by difference while the energy content was determined by using the Atwater factor (carbohydrate and protein values were each multiplied by 4 kcal/g, whereas fat values were each multiplied by 9 kcal/g).
