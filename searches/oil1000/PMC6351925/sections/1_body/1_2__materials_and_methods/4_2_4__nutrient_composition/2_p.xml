<p class="p">The amount of calcium, zinc, iron and phosphorus in the composite flours was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. About 5 g of flour was placed in a previously weighed porcelain crucible and heated. The resulting white ash was weighed, dissolved in 10 mL of 1:1 nitric acid (prepared by dissolving 5 mL of nitric acid in 5 mL of distilled water), filtered into a 50 mL volumetric flask and diluted with distilled water to the 50 mL mark. The solutions were then taken to an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Shelton, CT, USA) and the absorbance read at 470 nm which was later used to determine the concentrations of calcium, zinc, iron, magnesium and copper. Standard stock solutions of calcium, zinc, iron, magnesium and copper were also prepared from AAS grade chemicals by appropriate dilution. Calibration curves were obtained by plotting the concentration against the absorbance for the calcium, zinc, iron, sodium, and potassium measurements. Calibration equations were derived and concentrations of calcium, zinc, iron and phosphorus were expressed as mg/100 g.
