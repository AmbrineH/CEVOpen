<p class="p">The vitamin A (RAE) content of flours was estimated by acetone-petroleum ether extraction followed by spectrophotometric measurement and total carotenoids divided by 12 according to the modified Rodrigues-Amaya and Kimura method of total carotenoids analysis [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Extraction of carotenoids was performed by grinding of composite flours in a mortar using a pestle, filtration through a filter funnel filled with glass wool and separation from acetone to petroleum ether. The petroleum eluent adjusted to a specific volume was read at 450 nm in a spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for the concentration of total carotenoids. Vitamin A (RAE) was obtained by dividing total carotenoids by 12 and results expressed as micrograms per 100 g of dry weight (Âµg/100 g). All analyses were carried out in triplicate and measured on a dry weight basis.
