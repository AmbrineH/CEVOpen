<p class="p">Porridges were prepared by separately adding 200 g of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours in 250 mL of cold water. The resulting paste was added to 550 mL of boiling water and cooked for 15 min with constant stirring. The prepared porridge was kept in coded thermos vacuum flasks. The sensory attributes of porridges were evaluated by thirty (30) trained panelists comprising of students and staff in the School of Food Technology, Nutrition and Bio-Engineering, Makerere University. The ages of panelists ranged from 18 to 45 years and there were 16 females and 14 males. Each panelist sat in an individual booth and was provided with hot porridge samples in plastic disposable cups marked with 3-digit random codes. Each panelist was provided with drinking water to rinse the palate after each taste. The sensory attributes of porridges that were evaluated included general appearance, color, taste, aroma, thickness, and overall acceptability. The attributes were rated on a nine-point hedonic scale (like extremely = 9 to dislike extremely = 1).</p>
