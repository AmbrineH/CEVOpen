 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the contribution of OFSP-based composite flours to the RDAs of energy and protein for children aged 6–59 months. The study findings indicated that the protein contribution to the RDA reduced with an increase in the age of children. For children 0.5–1 year, the porridge from OFSP-based composite flours contributes 86.4 to 142.1% of the RDA for protein but it contributes only 50.4 to 82.9% for children aged 4–6 years. The energy contribution was 45.5 to 44.6% for children 0.5–1 year and 21.5 to 21.1% for children 4–6 years (
