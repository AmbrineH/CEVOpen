<p class="p">The high contribution of the OFSP-based composite porridges to RDAs for protein and energy are due to their reported high concentrations in the composite flours (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the contributions of protein that are above the RDA are non-toxic to the body because it was slightly above the protein requirement [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, it is recommended that protein intake should not be more than twice the RDA for protein [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Reduction in the contribution of energy and protein to the RDA with an increase in age is due to an increase in the bodyâ€™s needs during growth. For example, energy is needed for metabolic activities and body maintenance while protein is needed for growth and development in children. In order to meet the protein and energy RDAs of the older children, an intake of more than 100 mL of the OFSP-based composite porridge is recommended.
