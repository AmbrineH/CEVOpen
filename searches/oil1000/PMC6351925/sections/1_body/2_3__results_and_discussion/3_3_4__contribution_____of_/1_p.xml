 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> shows the calcium, iron and vitamin A contribution (%) of porridge from OFSP-based composite flours to the recommended dietary allowances for children aged 6–59 months. Findings from this study showed that the porridge from composite flours contributed more than 100% of the required iron. However, the porridge from OFSP flour only contributed 48% of the RDA for iron in children aged 6–59 months. The results further indicate that the mean calcium contributions of composite flours were between 45.9% and 95.7% of the RDA for children aged 6–59 months. Findings further show that the vitamin A contribution was above 100% in OFSP, GT1 and GT2 while those of GT3 and GT4 were below 100%. The high contributions of iron zinc, calcium and vitamin A were due to high concentrations as indicated in

Therefore, adoption of the OFSP-based flours and their proper preparations may greatly contribute to the reduction of mineral and vitamin A deficiencies among children aged 6–59 months.
