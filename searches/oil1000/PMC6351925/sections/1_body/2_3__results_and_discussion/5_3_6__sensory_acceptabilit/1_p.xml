 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> presents results from the mean sensory scores of porridge from OFSP-based composite flours. The degree of liking for the general appearance of porridges from composite flours decreased from 7.4 to 3.7 with an increase in the substitution levels of skimmed milk and amaranth leaves powders. Porridge from GT2 had the highest score (7.4) while that from GT4 had the lowest score (3.7). There were no significant (

 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). This is attributed to the increased levels of amaranth leaves powder added to the OFSP flour. The scores for the color of porridges from composite and OFSP flours followed the same trend as that of general appearance. This is probably because color is one of the attributes assessed under appearance.
