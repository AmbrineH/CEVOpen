<p class="p">The protein content of OFSP-based composite flours significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased from 4.1 to 19.9%. The protein content of GT3 and GT4 was higher than the protein value (15%) stipulated in the Codex standard of complementary foods. Therefore, GT3 and GT4 comply with the permitted levels (15%) of formulated complementary foods [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]). This observation could be due to the fact that blending of two or more plant and animal-based food materials increases the nutrient density of the food product [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Therefore, the addition of skimmed milk (34â€“37% protein) and amaranth leaves (32.5% protein) increased the protein content of OFSP-based composite flours. According to Mahmoud and Anany [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], an increase in the protein content (17.9%) of a complementary food formulated from rice, fib beans, sweet potato flour, and peanut oil was reported. This was probably due to incorporation of legumes (fib beans and peanut), which are rich in proteins.
