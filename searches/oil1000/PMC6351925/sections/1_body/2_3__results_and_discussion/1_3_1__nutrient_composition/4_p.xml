<p class="p">Study findings further indicated that addition of skimmed milk and amaranth leaf powder significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased the ash content of OFSP-based composite flours from 2.7 to 5.3%. The significant increase in the ash content in OFSP-based composite flours may be attributed to addition of amaranth leaf powders because they are reported to be rich in minerals (10.6% ash) [

 <xref rid="B34-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] who reported an increase in ash content in yellow maize flour from 1.3 to 4.6% with addition of 20% amaranth leaf powder. Thus, the OFSP-based composite flours would contribute to the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) of minerals required by children aged 6â€“59 months.
