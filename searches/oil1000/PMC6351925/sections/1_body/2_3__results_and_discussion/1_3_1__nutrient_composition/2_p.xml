<p class="p">The carbohydrate content of OFSP-based composite flours significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decreased from 86.0 to 67.8%. The decrease in carbohydrate content is attributed to the dilution effect of skimmed milk (49.5–52.0%) [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and amaranth leaf powders (28.2%) [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], which are low in total carbohydrates. However, the carbohydrate content of the OFSP-based composite flours is within the range (45 to 65%) recommended for infant feeding, making it suitable for use in the preparation of porridges for children aged 6–59 months. According to Amagloh and Coad [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], carbohydrate content of sweet potato, skimmed milk powder and maize based complementary foods was in the range 50.25 to 58.92%, which are lower than those reported in this study. A similar trend (64.8 to 57.1%) was also reported by Nkesiga and Okafor [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] with the addition of amaranth leaves powder in yellow maize flour at 20% substitution level. The higher carbohydrate content reported in this study could be due to differences in the proportions of ingredients used.
