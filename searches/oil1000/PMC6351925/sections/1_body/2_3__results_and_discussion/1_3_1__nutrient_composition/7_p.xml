<p class="p">The crude fiber content of OFSP-based composite flours significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased from 1.2 to 3.2%. This is attributed to higher levels of amaranth leaf powder added that is reported to have higher fiber content (18.11%) [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] than OFSP flour (2.57%) [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Findings from this study are in agreement with those reported by Beswa et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], who observed an increase in the crude fiber content of extruded pro-vitamin A bio-fortified maize snacks with addition of 1 and 3% amaranth leaf powder. The crude fiber content of the OFSP-based composite flours was within the recommended Codex Standards (5%) for complementary foods. Therefore, the composite flours are suitable for use in complementary feeding of children aged 6â€“59 months.
