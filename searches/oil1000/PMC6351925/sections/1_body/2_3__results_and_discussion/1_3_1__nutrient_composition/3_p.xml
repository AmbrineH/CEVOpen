<p class="p">There was no significant difference between the energy content of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours (

 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This might be explained by the fact that the ingredients added to OFSP did not have a lot of carbohydrates and therefore could not significantly alter the energy content of OFSP flour [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Findings in this study indicated a higher energy content compared to 350–360 kcal/100 g reported by [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] in yellow maize flour supplemented with 20% amaranth leaf powder. The higher energy content reported in this study may be explained by the high fat and carbohydrate contents recorded (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The energy content of OFSP-based composite flours is approximately half the total energy required for healthy breastfed infants; 615 kcal/day from 6 to 8 months of life, 686 kcal/day from 9 to 11 months and 894 kcal/day from 12 to 23 months [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Therefore, the OFSP-based composite flours are suitable for use in making porridges for children aged 6–59 months.
