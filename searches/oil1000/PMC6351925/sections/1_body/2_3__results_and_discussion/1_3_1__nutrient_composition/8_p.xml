 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The vitamin A (µg RAE) content of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours decreased from 1989.8 to 145.7 µg RAE/100 g with increase in the substitution levels of amaranth leaves and skimmed milk powders. The decrease in vitamin A (µg RAE) content of OFSP flour was significantly (

This could be attributed to the dilution effect due to addition of skimmed milk powder that has low levels of vitamin A (µg RAE). Findings from this study showed that vitamin A concentrations were higher than those reported by Amagloh and Coad [
