<p class="p">The moisture, ash, protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber and energy contents of OFSP-based composite flours on dry weight basis are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The moisture content of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours ranged from 5.4 to 5.9%. The moisture content of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours was slightly higher than the moisture content (&lt;5%) recommended by Codex standards for complementary foods but below the critical moisture (12%) content for flours. The low moisture content of the OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours is attributed to proper drying and handling. Therefore, the OFSP-based composite flours would be stable on the shelves for longer periods due to their low moisture contents. On the other hand, a moisture content ranging from 6.9 to 10.9% in different varieties of OFSP flours was reported by reference [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. This implies that the OFSP-based composite flours in this study would be more shelf-stable than those reported by reference [
