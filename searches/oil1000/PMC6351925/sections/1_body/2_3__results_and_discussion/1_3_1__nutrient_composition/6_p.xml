<p class="p">There was a significant increase (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the fat content of OFSP-based composite flours. The increase in fat content of OFSP-based composite flour is attributed to increase in levels of skimmed milk powder added to OFSP flour. Findings from this study showed a lower fat content (0.7 to 1.4%) than that (3.87 to 5.17%) reported by Tadese et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] in flat-bread prepared from blends of maize and OFSP flours. This is because maize flour has higher fat content (6.95%) [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] than skimmed milk powder (1.5%). The low-fat content of OFSP-based composite flours may be better for longer storage of the OFSP-based composite flours if properly packaged and stored in areas with low humidity and temperature.
