 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00013-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the correlation between the sensory attributes of porridges from OFSP-based composite flours. The map shows that the aroma is highly related to general appearance and it is correlated with the first factor (F1). It can also be confirmed that the general appearance, color and aroma are highly correlated with the first axis. It is also observed that all the sensory attributes are spread in the two of the four quadrants. On the other hand, the second factor (F2) is highly correlated with overall acceptability. Sample GT2 has the highest coordinate on the first axis and is highly related to the second factor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00013-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), which is highly related to taste and overall acceptability. Therefore, sample GT2 was the most highly accepted, likely due to the low levels of amaranth leaves powder. Furthermore, GT1 is in the direction of color and general appearance. Color and general appearance being the most important factors in determining acceptability of the food product would confirm that sample GT1 was most preferred in terms of these two attributes. This is attributed to very low levels of amaranth leaves powder added that might have not imparted a significant change in the color of OFSP flour. In contrast, porridge from samples GT3 and GT4 has the worst ratings. This observation is consistent with what was earlier observed, which is that no sensory attribute was in this quadrant. A zero correlation was observed between thickness and other sensory attributes for all porridges.
