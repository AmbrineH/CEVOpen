<p class="p">The bulk density of the flours ranged from 0.5 to 0.6 g/mL. The bulk densities obtained in this study were insignificantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) very low and this indicates that the flours would be advantageous in the preparation of complementary foods. The study findings are in agreement with those of reference [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] who reported a bulk density of 0.6 g/mL in orange flesh sweet potato, sorghum and soybean blend. Bulk density is a measure of heaviness of a flour sample and this gives an indication that the relative volume of the composite flours in a package will not reduce excessively during storage.
