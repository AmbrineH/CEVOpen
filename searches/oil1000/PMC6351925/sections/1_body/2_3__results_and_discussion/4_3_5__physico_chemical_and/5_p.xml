 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00013-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the pasting properties of OFSP-based composite flours. The results indicated that OFSP flour recorded the highest peak (1046.5 cP) and final (191.5 cP) viscosities. The peak and final viscosities of the composite flours decreased with increasing levels of substitution of skimmed milk and amaranth leaves powders. The decrease in peak viscosity was from 464.0 to 180.0 cP, while that of final viscosity was from 122.5 to 116.5 cP. The decrease in peak and final viscosities of composite flours compared to OFSP flour is attributed to the high fiber contents of the composites due to addition of amaranth leaves powders. Fiber competes with starch for the limited amount of water available in a food system [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00013-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> indicate that composite flours had lower final and peak viscosities than OFSP flour. This is nutritionally beneficial in infant formulas since a less viscous porridge is a better weaning food for children.
