<p class="p">Water absorption capacity is the ability of flour to absorb water and swell, for improved consistency in food. It is desirable for food systems to improve yield and consistency and to give body to the food. The water absorption capacity (WAC) of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decreased from 62.8 to 58.0%. On the other hand, there was no significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) decrease in WAC between samples GT2, GT3 and GT4. The high WAC recorded for the OFSP flour could be due to its small and uniform particle size, giving a higher surface area and high capillarity in the flour [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The values of the water absorption capacity obtained for the flours correspond with the swelling power and solubility. This implies that the low WAC of the OFSP-based composite flours obtained in this study will be desirable for making thinner gruel with a high caloric density per unit value. The oil absorption capacity (OAC) of OFSP and OFSP-based composite flours significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased from 25.4 to 73.5% (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Oil absorption is important because oil acts as a flavor retainer and increases the mouth feel of foods, improves palatability and extends the shelf-life of foods, especially in bakery or meat products where fat absorptions are desired [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The increase in OAC in OFSP-based composite flours is attributed to the high protein content due to the addition of skimmed milk and amaranth leaves powders. The high protein content of composite flours enhanced hydrophobicity by exposing more polar amino acids to the fat. This observation is consistent with the reports of reference [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], who observed an increase in OAC of composite flours prepared by blending sweet potato flour with maize flour, soy bean flour and xanthan gum from 2.03 to 2.2 g/g. This is probably due to the addition of skimmed milk and amaranth leaves powders that are rich in proteins. The high OAC of the composite flours indicates that the flours could also be used in making bakery products for infants.
