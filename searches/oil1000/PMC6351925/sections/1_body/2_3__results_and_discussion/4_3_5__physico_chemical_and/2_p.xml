<p class="p">The swelling power indicates the degree of water absorption of the starch granules in the flour during heating [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. As a result of water absorption and heat, starch granules swell resulting in a viscous paste. There were no significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) differences in the swelling power among the composite flours but significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.048) difference was observed between composite flours and OFSP flour (control). The increasing levels of amaranth leaves and skimmed milk powders decreased the swelling power of composite flours. This is probably due to reduction in the number of starch granules due to lower carbohydrate content (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) as a result of the addition of skimmed milk and amaranth leaf powders. The low swelling power of the composite flours makes them suitable for use in the preparation of gruels used as weaning foods, as they will result in porridges of low viscosity desirable for children due to the low volumes of their stomachs. Findings from this study are consistent with those of reference [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] that reported a decrease in swelling power in sweet potato-based composite flour with an increasing amount of soybean flour being added.
