 <xref rid="foods-08-00013-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> presents the physico-chemical and functional properties of orange fleshed sweet potato-based composite flours on dry weight basis. The functional properties determine the application and use of food materials for various food products. The decrease in solubility of flours was not significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.423) while swelling power significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.048) decreased from 0.9 to 0.5%. The non-significant decrease in solubility of OFSP-based composite flours is attributed to the dilution effect of sugars in the flours by addition of skimmed milk and amaranth leaves powder that have lower sugar content than OFSP flour. According to reference [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], high sugar content favors the formation of hydrogen bonds, increasing solubility. Therefore, the low solubility of OFSP-based composite flours is due to low sugars. As such, the developed composite flours are less soluble in water due to low sugars but would still be soluble due to high protein content that exposes hydrophilic groups during porridge making. The study findings are in agreement with those of reference [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], who reported a solubility of 3.12% in orange flesh sweet potato-sorghum-soy blend at a ratio of 40:40:20.
