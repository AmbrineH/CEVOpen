<p class="p">The setback or viscosity of cooked paste is the viscosity after cooling the paste to 50 °C. The extent of increase in viscosity on cooling to 50 °C reflects the retrogradation tendency, a phenomenon that causes the paste to become firmer and increasingly resistant to enzyme attack [

 <xref rid="B51-foods-08-00013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], while lower setback during cooling of the paste indicates a lower tendency for retrogradation and subsequently higher digestibility. The low setback values for the OFSP-based composite flours indicate that their pastes would have higher stability against retrogradation than OFSP flour. The lower set back viscosities also imply that the porridge when consumed by children would be easy to digest.
