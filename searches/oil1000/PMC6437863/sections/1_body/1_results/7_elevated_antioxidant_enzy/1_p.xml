 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Moreover, the mechanism by which terpenes alleviate abiotic stress suggests a general antioxidant mechanism by which harmful ROS can be quenched by reacting with unsaturated isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the presence of elevated levels of ROS, increased significantly under all treatments, except for a decrease in leaves exposed to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity (approx. 250 μmol m

 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>a). Catalase (CAT) plays an important role in the antioxidant system because it enables plants to eliminate H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> by converting H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (Miller et al., 2008). CAT activity was strongly elevated by these two elicitors. When the three tissues were exposed to temperature and light stresses, CAT activity was upregulated, the only exception being a slight decreased in leaves in response to high light intensity (Fig.
