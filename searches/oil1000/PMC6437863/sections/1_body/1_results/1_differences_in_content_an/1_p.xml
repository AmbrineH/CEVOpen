<p id="Par39" class="p">To understand the distribution pattern and differences in components of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> volatiles, we examined the metabolic compounds from pentane extracts of young leaves (YL), sapwood (SW) and HW from mature trees and immature wood (IW) from immature trees by GC-MS. There were significant differences in the volatile content among the four tissues. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, the most abundant volatile was detected in HW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a-d). Major sesquiterpenols, α- and β-santalol, were detected in these four tissues, and sesquiterpenes, α- and β-santalene, and 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-β-santalene were identified in YL and HW, but not in IW and SW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>e-i, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1). It was curious that trace amounts of α- and β-santalene, 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-β-santalene and α-santalol (peaks 1, 3, 5 and 8, respectively) were found in almost the same proportion in YL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>e). Of these, the distribution of the first three compounds matched that in HW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>h, peaks 1, 3 and 5). Moreover, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bergamotene, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene, and β-bisabolene were also detected from leaf extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic>. Almost the same distribution of sesquiterpenols as those in SW and HW was observed in IH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> f, g and i, peaks 8–15), indicating that the accumulation of sandalwood oil occurs at an early developmental stage of the stems and that more essential oil is biosynthesized in HW as the sandalwood tree grows older.
