<p id="Par51" class="p">To explore the responses of the three 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> genes under elicitors as well as temperature and high light intensity treatments, transcript levels for 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> were determined by qRT-PCR. 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> exhibited similar expression patterns in response to the two elicitors. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>a and b, exogenous MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> genes in leaves at 24 h, with more than a 170- and 130-fold increase, respectively, when compared with the controls. 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> transcripts also increased significantly in stems and roots after the application of MeJA. 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> expression was activated in leaves, stems and roots with an approximately 5-, 3-, and 4-fold increase, respectively compared to the corresponding controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>c). In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> was significantly up-regulated in leaves by SA, but decreased in stems and roots. Moreover, the accumulation of 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> transcript were similar to that of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> in leaves under MeJA and SA treatments. However, the two exogenous hormones led to a decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> expression in roots compared with the control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>d).
