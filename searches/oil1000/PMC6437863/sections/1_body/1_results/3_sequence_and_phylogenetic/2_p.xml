<p id="Par42" class="p">A phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino acid of sandalwood TPSs and other plant species showed that all 
 <italic class="italic">Santalum</italic> TPSs clustered in the TPS-b clade, with the exception of SasesquiTPS and sesquiTPSs in 
 <italic class="italic">S. spicatum</italic> (SspicsesquiTPS) and

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. The most similar TPS sequence to SaTPS1 is that of (−)-α-terpineol synthase from 
 <italic class="italic">V. vinifera</italic> with 63% identity (Additional file

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S6) (Martin and Bohlmann, 2004). SaTPS2 clustered most closely to SaSSY, SspicSSY and SaustSSY, with a 100% bootstrap (Jones et al., 2011), and its amino acid sequence had highest identity with SaspiSSY (72%). SaTPS3 formed a clade with several previously characterized TPSs from 
 <italic class="italic">Santalum</italic> species, including SaMonoTPS, SaSQS1, SaSQS2, SaBS, SspicBS and Sspicsesquisabinene [
