<p id="Par44" class="p">To elucidate the function of SaTPS1 to 3, subcellular localization of each SaTPS-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) fusion protein provided preliminary evidence. Phylogenetic and bioinformatics-based analyses in an attempt to classify TPSs indicated that SaTPS1-YFP, which has the N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence, was localized in chloroplasts, whereas SaTPS2-YFP and SaTPS3-YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Based on the results of subcellular localization, it was concluded that SaTPS1 is likely involved in monoterpene biosynthesis in plastids, whereas SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might produce sesquiterpenes in the cytosol.
