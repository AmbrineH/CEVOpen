<p id="Par46" class="p">GC-MS analysis of the reaction products catalyzed by SaTPS2 with FPP as a substrate in the presence of Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> identified at least 15 sesquiterpenoids, with (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bergamotene (24.8%) and sesquisabinene (33.0%) as the two major products, β-bisabolene (9.0%), γ-bisabolene isomer (7.9%), and minor compounds, 7-

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S7). A similar product profile comprising the major compounds, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bergamotene (22.4%) and sesquisabinene (35.6%), were detected when Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> was replaced with Mn
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, but overall yield was relatively lower (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S7, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S7). Incubation of SaTPS2 with GPP as a substrate and Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> ion led to the production of nine monoterpenes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S7). The most abundant compound was linalool (64.9%). Likewise, assays with Mn
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> instead of Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> showed that almost the same compounds were observed, but overall yield was 5-fold lower (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S8, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S7). Taken together, these results indicate that SaTPS2 is a multifunctional sesqui-TPS producing major (
