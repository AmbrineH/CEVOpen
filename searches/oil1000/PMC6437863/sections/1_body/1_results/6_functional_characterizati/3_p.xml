<p id="Par47" class="p">SaTPS3 converts FPP and GPP substrates to sesqui- and monoterpene products, respectively. When assayed with FPP and Mg
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, recombinant SaTPS3 catalyzed the synthesis of seven compounds, including (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene (20.7%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol (29.8%) and (
 <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-farnesol (21.3%) as the three major products, while a high proportion of γ-bisabolene (13.8%) was also produced (Fig.
