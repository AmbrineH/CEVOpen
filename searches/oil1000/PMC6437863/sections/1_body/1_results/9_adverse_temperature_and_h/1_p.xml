 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> expression levels were inhibited in leaves at 4°C and 38°C, but were significantly activated in roots when compared to the controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>e-g), suggesting that oxidative damage in leaves was more severe than in stems and roots. When exposed to high light intensity, 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> transcripts showed higher expression in stems and roots than in leaves, particularly 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic>, with a 25-fold increase in stems. The level of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> transcripts was highest in roots under 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity stresses, with approximately 2-, 6-, and 8-fold increases, respectively, compared to the control. Conversely, 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> transcript only increased by about 2-fold in roots at 4°C compared to the control. In all other cases, the expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> was down-regulated to some extent in all tissues examined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>h).
