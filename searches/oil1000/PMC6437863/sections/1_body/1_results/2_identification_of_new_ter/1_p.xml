<p id="Par40" class="p">We combined transcriptome sets downloaded from NCBI, including transcripts from leaves, stems and roots as described in the Methods. D
 <italic class="italic">e novo</italic> assembly yielded 164,548 unigenes from the three tissues (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2). Many unigenes were identified as 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> genes, including 38 core terpene synthase genes and nine triterpene-specific synthase genes (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S3). Of these, six unigene sequences were completely aligned with those of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> submitted to NCBI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Three unigenes contained full-length ORFs encoding TPSs, designated as 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic>. In order to confirm that the assembled unigenes generated using the Trinity assembler were accurate, we designed primers to anneal around the predicted start and stop codons of unigenes to amplify ORFs of the three predicted 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> genes (Fig. S2). Subsequent sequencing of these nucleotides demonstrated that they were exactly as predicted by the unigene assembly.
