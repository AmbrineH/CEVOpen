<p id="Par43" class="p">The tissue-specific expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> genes was determined by qRT-PCR in four key tissues, i.e., YL, IW, SW and HW. The transcript abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> genes showed a similar expression pattern, with highest expression in YL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> showed three-fold higher expression in IW than in YL, SW and HW. In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> was 100- and 250-fold higher in SW and HW, respectively. Additionally, comparisons of the expression levels among these 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPSs</italic> in specific tissues showed that 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> showed higher expression than 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and Sa
 <italic class="italic">TPS2</italic> in the four corresponding tissues (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> :Figure S4). Of note, the level of 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> transcript showed a 200- and 1200-fold increase relative to 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> in SW and HW, respectively. These results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> might play a role in the accumulation of HW essential oil whereas 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> play a minor role in the formation of terpenoids in 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> HW.
