<p id="Par54" class="p">The major components of the total essential oil in the heartwood of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> are α- and β-santalol, contributing over 80% of relative content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. SaSSY is a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of α- and β-santalol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Our study’s findings are in agreement with previous studies that showed that sandalwood essential oil accumulates in stem HW, followed by SW [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. However, α- and β-santalene and 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-β-santalene were not detected in SW, most likely due to undetectable or low amounts. To our knowledge, trace levels of volatiles consisting of α- and β-santalene, 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-β-santalene, α- and β-santalol, and other compounds in the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> were first reported in this study. The distribution pattern of sesquiterpenols similar to those in SW and HW was found in IH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>f, g and i). Collectively, these results established a foundation to reveal the mechanism of spatial and temporal distribution of volatiles in 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic>. Moreover, high expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> in the HW of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> confirm that santalol content is closely related with 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> transcript level (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
