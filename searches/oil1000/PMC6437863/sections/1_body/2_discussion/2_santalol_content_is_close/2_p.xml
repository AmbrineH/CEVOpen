 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> genes had relatively high expression levels in leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and S4a) and trace amounts of (

 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene and β-bisabolene in the leaves of mature 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> trees were also detected, suggesting that SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might convert FPP to these sesquiterpenes, which belonged to major products when incubated with FPP in in vitro enzyme assays (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>a and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S7). In addition, major α-terpineol catalyzed by SaTPS1 was not identified in leaf extracts, inferring that it might be easily volatilized or that external stimuli might be required for its emission, aspects that still need to be explored.
