<p id="Par59" class="p">The inductive roles played by JA- and SA-induced biosynthesis of terpenoids have also been widely demonstrated in recent years, playing similar roles as those during attack induced by fungal elicitation and mechanical wounding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. For example, the transcript level of 
 <italic class="italic">TPS1</italic> producing (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-farnesol in vitro in maize cv. B73 was elevated after herbivory, or after mechanical damage with and without treatment with 5 μl of Egyptian cotton leafworm regurgitant or 5 μl of volicitin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. The volatile (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bergamotene is a well-characterized defensive compound in wounded leaves induced by herbivores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>] and in flowers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>] of 
 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana attenuata</italic> induced by JA-mediated signaling. To date, little is known about the roles of α-terpineol produced by TPSs in plant defense. In 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic>, the expression levels of genes coding for HMCR and FPPS were slightly induced in the leaves and stems of seedlings after the foliar application of 0.1% MeJA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. In our study, increased enzyme activities in the ROS antioxidant defense system and the sharp accumulation of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> transcripts by exogenously applied MeJA and SA in leaves suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> play defensive roles against biotic stresses. Similarly, elevated levels of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> transcripts induced by MeJA in the three tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>c) inferred that 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> had similarly defensive roles to 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic>. Moreover, MeJA led to increases of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> transcripts in stems and roots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>a and b). Collectively, this demonstrates that both local and systemic defense responses were triggered by exogenously applied MeJA in 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> seedlings. This result is the same as findings reported by Koo et al. (2009) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>] in Arabidopsis and Delaunois et al. (2014) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>] in grapevine, in which local activation of JA and its biologically active derivatives (i.e., MeJA) as JA signaling molecules spread systemically throughout the plant and induce JA responses in distant organs. In general, SA is mainly associated with resistance to biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, and triggers systemic acquired resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>]. The reason why exogenous SA resulted in the downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> genes in treated roots needs to be further explored. Simultaneously, activated expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> in leaves and stems by MeJA and SA offers a cue for further exploring the mechanism of santalol biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic>.
