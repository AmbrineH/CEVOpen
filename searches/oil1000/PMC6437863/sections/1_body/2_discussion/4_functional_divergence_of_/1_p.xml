 <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-FPP to a single product, sesquisabinene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. SspiTPS4 catalyzed the formation of the most abundant sesquisabinene B (58%) in

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. In this study, although a phylogenetic tree showed that SaTPS2 is much closer to SaSSY, SspicSSY and SaustSSY than to SaSQS1, SaSQS2 and SspiTPS4, in vitro enzyme assays of recombinant SaTPS2 and subcellular localization revealed that the mRNA of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> encodes a functional sesqui-TPS producing (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bergamotene (24.8%) and sesquisabinene (33.0%) as two major products. Moreover, both recombinant SaBS and SauBS can react with FPP to produce β-bisabolene as a major product [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. SspiBS produced a mixture of β-bisabolene and α-bisabolol, along with traces of α-bisabolene and farnesene isomers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. SaTPS2 could synthesize a relatively large amount of β-bisabolene (9.0%) and γ-bisabolene (1.6%) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S7). Taken together, these results suggest that functional divergence of TPS has occurred in 
 <italic class="italic">Santalum</italic> species. The diversification of terpenoid biosynthesis has also been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">Oryza TPS</italic> genes [
