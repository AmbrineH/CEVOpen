<p id="Par58" class="p">In angiosperms, only the maize gene 
 <italic class="italic">TPS1</italic> produces (

 <italic class="italic">Santalum</italic> spp. in the TPS-b group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The function of SaTPS3 is similar to TPS1 in maize where it catalyzes the formation of three major compounds, i.e. (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene (20.7%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-nerolidol (29.8%) and (
 <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-farnesol (21.3%). However, SaTPS3 additionally synthesized γ-bisabolene, cedrene and two unknown sesquiterpene compounds in relative amounts that exceeded 28%, suggesting that SaTPS3 is not a highly conserved TPS in angiosperms. Diversity of function may be an evolution of adaptive selection in monocotyledons and dicotyledons.
