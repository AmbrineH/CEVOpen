<p id="Par60" class="p">Environmental factors play important roles governing the emission of biogenic terpenes. The emission of some terpene volatiles is highly dependent on temperature, light and oxidative stresses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. In loblolly pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus taeda</italic>), high light intensity and temperature induced the emission of (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-α-bergamotene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. Our previous work showed that 
 <italic class="italic">SaSS/BS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaMonoTPS1</italic> accumulated to high levels in the roots of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> in response to 4°C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. In that study, the full-length of 
 <italic class="italic">SaSS/BS</italic> was rediscovered as 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> in this study. In the present study, the expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> in leaves and roots after exposure for 12 h to 4°C were similar to our previous results, in which a decrease of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS2</italic> transcripts in leaves and significant up-regulation in roots were observed. Although adverse temperature and light inhibited the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> genes in leaves, high or low temperature significantly induced an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> transcripts in roots. High light intensity induced a remarkable elevation of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS3</italic> transcripts in stems and roots. There are two possible reasons for these trends. The first is that leaves are directly exposed to adverse stresses and responded more quickly to these stresses than stems and roots. The second is that there are differences in resource allocation between above- and underground tissues during the stress response. Nevertheless, these results imply that 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> play a role in protecting sandalwood from abiotic stresses. In contrast, the decrease of almost all 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic> transcripts in treated tissues suggests that environmental stresses affect the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SaSSY</italic>, unlike 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic>.
