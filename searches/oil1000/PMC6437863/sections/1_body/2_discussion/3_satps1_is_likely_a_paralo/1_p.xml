<p id="Par56" class="p">A study by Jones et al. (2008) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] documented that SamonoTPS1 is a monoterpene synthase which produced a mixture of eight compounds, with α-terpineol (38.7%) and limonene (35.3%) as the two main products when incubated with GPP. In angiosperms, α-terpineol synthase from 
 <italic class="italic">V. vinifera</italic> was reported as a monoterpene synthase, producing 14 compounds, including major monoterpene, α-terpineol (50.1%), 1,8-cineol (11.8%), β-pinene (8.5%), etc. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>] reported that FhTPS2 in flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">Freesia</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">hybrida</italic> mainly converted GPP into α-terpineol (78.7%) and a few other monoterpenes, such as 1,8-cineole (6.9%), D-limonene (3.9%), α-pinene (3.2%), etc. In our study, SaTPS1 showed higher similarity at the nucleotide level with α-terpineol synthase sequences in 
 <italic class="italic">V. vinifera</italic> than SamonoTPS1, and both of them have an N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence and are closely related (Fig.
