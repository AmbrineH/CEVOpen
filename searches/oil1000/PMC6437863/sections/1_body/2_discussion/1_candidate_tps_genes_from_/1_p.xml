<p id="Par53" class="p">Next generation sequencing has emerged as a promising platform to discover novel genes, enzymes, and molecular markers from non-model plant species. In recent years, transcriptomic approaches have been widely used to mine genes of terpenoid metabolism in 
 <italic class="italic">Santalum</italic>. Research has mainly focused on cloning and characterization of SaTPSs, including SamonoTPS, SasesquiTPS, SaSSy, SauSSY, SspiSSY, SaSQS1, SaSQS2, SaBS, SauBS, SspiBS, and SspiTPS4 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>] found more than 30 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> transcripts from a HW-specific transcriptome. In the present study, a set of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPSs</italic> was identified based on a combination of transcriptome data from leaves, stems and roots, implying that 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> likely has a mid-sized 
 <italic class="italic">TPS</italic> gene family according to the classification of other angiosperm TPSs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Currently, the genome assembly data of 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> is available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>], and we are eager to obtain the annotated genome so as to assess the exact size of TPSs in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> TPS family. Additionally, some TPSs specific to different tissues were detected (Additional file
