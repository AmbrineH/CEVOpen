<p id="Par36" class="p">Moreover, the emission of some biogenic terpenes can be induced by environmental factors such as temperature and light. High temperature was first recognized as one abiotic stress capable of inducing volatile terpenoids in slash pine (

In addition, the elevated emission of a variety of terpene volatiles, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, from leaves, flowers and other organs in a range of woody and herbaceous species was observed under temperature, light, drought and salt stresses [

A common biochemical mechanism explaining the emission of volatile terpenoids induced by exogenous stresses claims that plants have the ability to synthesize terpenoids against oxidative damage resulting in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
