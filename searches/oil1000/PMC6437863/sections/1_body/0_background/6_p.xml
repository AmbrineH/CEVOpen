<p id="Par37" class="p">More than 150 terpenoid compounds were identified from the essential oil of sandalwood (
 <italic class="italic">Santalum album</italic>) heartwood (HW) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. The major components were α- and β-santalol, but some minor compounds also exist, including α-santalene, β-santalene, α-bergamotene, and others. In recent years, key genes responsible for santalol biosynthesis have been functionally characterized, including santalene synthase (SaSSY) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], SaCYP736A167 and SaCYP76AF39V1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Another five TPSs, namely SamonoTPS1, SasesquiTPS1, Sasesquisabinene synthases (SaSQS1 and SaSQS2), and Sabisabolene synthase (SaBS), have also been identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Kulheim et al. (2014) attempted to enhance the essential oil productivity of sandalwood by applying 0.01% MeJA to the leaves of seedling younger than one year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Their findings indicate that the expression levels of only two genes coding for hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMCR) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) were slightly induced in leaves and stems of seedlings in response to MeJA treatment. Our previous study in 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> indicated that six 
 <italic class="italic">TPS</italic> unigenes coding for (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-ocimene/α-farnesene synthase, santalene/bergamotene synthase 1 (SS/BS), nerolidol synthase 1-like, myrcene synthase, geranyl linalool synthase, and SamonoTPS1 were differentially expressed in response to cold stress (4°C) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. However, little is known about the contribution of TPSs in response to various adverse environmental stresses in
