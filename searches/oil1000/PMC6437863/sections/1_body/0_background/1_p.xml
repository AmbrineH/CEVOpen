<p id="Par32" class="p">Terpenoids constitute the largest and most diverse class of chemical compounds present in all living organisms. In particular, flowering plants exhibit an unusually high number of terpenoids for a variety of basic functions in growth and development, including hormones, components of electron transfer systems, reagents for protein modification, determinants of membrane fluidity, antioxidants, and others [

Traditionally, specialized terpenoids are used as natural flavor and aroma compounds and have a beneficial impact on humans as health-promoting compounds. Moreover, the ecological functions of terpenoids have gained increased attention [
