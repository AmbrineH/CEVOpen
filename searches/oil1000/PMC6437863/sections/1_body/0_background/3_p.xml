<p id="Par34" class="p">During recent decades, there has been major progress in the identification and functional characterization of genes and enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Many mono-TPS and sesqui-TPS genes have been reported from several plants, including Arabidopsis (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. An unusual feature of many TPSs is that they are able to produce terpenoids of structurally and stereochemically diverse compounds from a single substrate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Based on sequence relatedness, functional assessment and gene architecture, the TPS gene family has been divided into eight subfamilies, designated as TPS-a through TPS-h [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Class I contains TPS-c (copalyl diphospate synthases), TPS-e (
 <italic class="italic">ent</italic>-kaurene synthases), TPS-f (other di-TPSs), and TPS-h (lycopod-specific); Class II consists of TPS-d, which is gymnosperm-specific; Class III consists of angiosperm-specific TPS-a, TPS-b (cyclic mono-TPSs and hemi-TPSs), and TPS-g (acyclic mono-TPSs).
