<p id="Par33" class="p">All plant terpenes are made from the two simple five-carbon building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate, both of which are derived from the mevalonate pathway in the cytosol or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in plastids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Condensation of the C5 precursors leads to the formation of prenyl diphosphates, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which are subsequently converted into monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes by terpene synthases (TPSs), respectively. Terpenoid biosynthesis occurs within specific tissues or at specific developmental stages in plants, such as in resin ducts and glandular trichomes [
