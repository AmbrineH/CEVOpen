<p id="Par38" class="p">In this study, transcriptomic data from leaves, stems and roots which were deposited at the Sequence Read Archive (SRC) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] were integrated to identify expressed members of the sandalwood TPS gene family. Of these, three 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> genes, designated as 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic>, were isolated and functionally characterized. The expression pattern and roles of 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> besides SaSSY in response to MeJA, SA, and adverse temperature and light, were comparatively investigated. This study paves the way for revealing the regulatory mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of terpenoids in biotic and abiotic stresses in 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic>.
