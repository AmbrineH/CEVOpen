 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Volatile terpenoids are inducibly emitted in response to herbivore or pathogen attacks in plants, and not only function directly as defensive phytoalexins for deterring detrimental attackers but also indirectly attract natural enemies of pathogens and herbivores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Studies have shown that the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play important roles during biotic attack as defensive signaling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Therefore, exogenously applied JA and SA can be used as biotic stress mimics for studying the mechanism underlying the interaction between plants and biotic stresses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>], and for increasing the production of plant terpenoids in specific organs to produce specialized terpenoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. For example, in sweet wormwood (
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia annua</italic>), JA can induce the 
 <italic class="italic">AaMYC2</italic> gene coding for a basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor that binds directly to G-box-like motifs within the promoters of two genes encoding multifunction cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) and artemisinic aldehyde delta-11 (13) reductase during artemisinin biosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">A. annua</italic>, SA enhanced the expression level of amorpha-4,11-diene synthase and increased artemisinin production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. In agarwood (
 <italic class="italic">Aquilaria sinensis</italic>), exogenously applied methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in cell suspension cultures, callus and plant stems induced the biosynthesis and accumulation of sesquiterpene compounds, especially δ-guaiene [
