<p id="Par66" class="p">Total RNA was extracted according to Kolosova et al. (2004) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>] and Jones et al. (2011) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Specific primers used to amplify full-length cDNAs are listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S8. The DNA molecules were amplified by PCR using high fidelity Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara Bio Inc., Dalian, China) and sequenced at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). The gene-specific oligonucleotide primers used for qRT-PCR analysis are described in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S8. qRT-PCR was performed as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>].
