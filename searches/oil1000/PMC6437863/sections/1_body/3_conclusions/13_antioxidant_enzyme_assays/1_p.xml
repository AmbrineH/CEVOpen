<p id="Par73" class="p">The activities of antioxidant enzymes, including SOD (EC1.15.1.1), CAT (EC1.11.1.6), POD (EC1.11.1.7) and APX (EC1.11.1.11) of leaves, stems and roots of untreated and treated samples were separately tested using activity assay kits (product codes BC0175 for SOD, BC0200 for CAT, BC0095 for POD, and BC0220 for APX; Solarbio, Beijing, China). A total of 100 mg of plant tissue was crushed using a mortar and pestle in corresponding extraction buffer and the supernatant was collected after centrifuging at 8000 or 13,000 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C. SOD activity was determined on the basis of the inhibition of the photochemical reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium at 560 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>]. CAT activity was expressed as 1 nM of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> degradation/min at 240 nm. One unit of POD activity was defined as the increase by one unit/min at 470 nm. APX activity was expressed as 1 μM of ascorbate oxidized/min at 290 nm.
