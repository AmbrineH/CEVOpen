<p id="Par61" class="p">After mining publicly-available RNA-seq data, three new terpene synthase genes were biochemically characterized. They were shown to be multifunctional mono- and sesqui-TPSs. The occurrence of functional divergence of TPS led to the formation of a diversity of terpenoids in 
 <italic class="italic">Santalum</italic> spp. Our work demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> genes play important roles in chemical defense and in protection against temperature and light stress. This study provides a basis for assessing the roles of SaTPSs in direct or indirect defense against pathogen attacks and in regulating environmental stresses. We are currently in the process of overexpressing 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS1</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">3</italic> as part of a program to genetically improve sandalwood for enhanced resistance to pathogens, such as powdery mildew, which severely infect 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> leaves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Furthermore, greater attention should be paid to the environmental significance of the volatile terpenoids in 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> essential oil, which is present in the highly valued aromatic HW.
