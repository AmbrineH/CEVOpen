 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S8 and S9). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at BGI. The fusion constructs and m-Cherry fluorescence protein were transformed into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>]. The transformed protoplasts were incubated at 22°C for 16–24 h. YFP fluorescence was observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X, Wetzlar, Germany).
