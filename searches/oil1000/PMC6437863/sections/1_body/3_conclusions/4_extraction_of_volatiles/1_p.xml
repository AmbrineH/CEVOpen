 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>] method with minor changes. Briefly, YL, SW, HW and IW samples were air dried for one week, extracted using 200 mg of ground tissue with 5 ml of pentane, spiked with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-dodecane as an internal standard (0.05 μl/ml), then mixed end-over-end for 48 h at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> at 4°C for 20 min and the pentane phase was transferred to a new GC vial. Then 1 μl was injected for GC/MS analysis after being reduced to 50 μl with a stream of dry nitrogen. Analyses were performed using three biological replicates, each of which comprised two technical replicates.
