 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]. For SaTPS1, two constructs were made, one with and one without the transit peptide. The 
 <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> cDNA fragments obtained with primers designed with restriction enzyme sites at the ends were cloned into the pET-28a vector (Novagen) to generate 6His-SaTPSs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S8 and S9). The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at BGI. His-SaTPS recombinant proteins were induced into the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> Rossetta 2 (DE3) strain (Novagen) according to the method of Srivastava et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Purification of the recombinant proteins was performed with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) and the eluted proteins were desalted on a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) following the Jones et al. method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. The concentration of proteins was determined using the Bradford method [
