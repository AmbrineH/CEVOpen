<p id="Par71" class="p">GC-MS analysis was performed on a GCMS-QP2010 SE (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The injector temperature was 230°C, splitless mode was used with a splitless time of 1 min, and helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The GC temperatures were 60°C for 3 min, ramp of 4°C/min to 230°C, and maintained at 230°C for 20 min. Scan ranges: 40–220

The volatile components and enzyme products were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the NIST2005 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), NIST2005s, NIST2014, NIST2014s and FFNSC1.3 (Flavors and fragrances of natural and synthetic compounds version 1.3) library data for GC-MS and comparison of their retention indices (RIs). RIs were determined on the basis of an
