<p id="Par62" class="p">Young leaves (YL) were harvested from 10-year-old mature 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> trees growing in a sandalwood plantation at the South China Botanical Garden. Wood shavings from SW and HW tissues were separately collected by drilling the stems of the same 
 <italic class="italic">S. album</italic> trees at 30 cm from the ground using a Hagloff wood borer. To assess transcript accumulation of young trees, wood shavings from the stems of immature three-year-old trees (IW, immature wood) about 3 cm in diameter were also obtained. Tissue samples from three individuals were pooled as one biological replicate for gene expression and GC-MS analysis of volatiles, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80°C until further use.
