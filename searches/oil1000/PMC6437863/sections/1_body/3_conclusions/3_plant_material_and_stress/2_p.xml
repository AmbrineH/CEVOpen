The foliage of six-month-old seedlings was sprayed at a rate of 10 ml per plant with 1 mM MeJA or SA solution which included 0.1% Tween 80 as a surfactant. The induction period was 24 h. Control plants were treated with a 0.1% Tween 80 solution at the same application dose. Treated plants were placed separately in different greenhouses in order to avoid cross-contamination under the same growth conditions. Seedlings with uniform growth were acclimated in a phytotron at 28°C/23°C (day/night), 14-h photoperiod, and 100 μmol m

Leaves, stems and roots were separately harvested after the completion of each treatment, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80°C until use. Samples from three individuals were pooled as a biological replicate and repeated three times as three independent biological duplicates.
