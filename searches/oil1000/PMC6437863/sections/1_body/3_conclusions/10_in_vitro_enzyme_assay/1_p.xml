<p id="Par70" class="p">Enzymatic reactions were performed in a 2-ml screw-capped GC glass vial in a final volume of 500 μl containing 10 μg recombinant TPS, reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or MnCl

 <italic class="italic">E,E</italic>)-FPP, GPP, or GGPP (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixtures were carefully overlaid with 500 μl of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 2 h at 30°C. The vial was then vigorously vortexed for 1 min to trap volatile products. After centrifuging at 2000
