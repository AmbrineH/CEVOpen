 <p> Effects of external stresses on activities of antioxidant enzymes in S. album. Six-month-old seedlings were sprayed with 1 mM MeJA or SA for 24 h or exposed to 4°C, 38°C or high light intensity (approx. 250 μmol m − 2 s − 1) for 12 h. Three measurements were averaged from the results of three replicated experiments. a: SOD, superoxide dismutase; b: CAT, catalase; c: POD, peroxidase; d: APX, ascorbate peroxidase. L, leaves; S, stems; R, roots. Significant differences were analyzed by a student’s t-test and indicated as * P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01 and *** P &lt; 0.001 </p>
