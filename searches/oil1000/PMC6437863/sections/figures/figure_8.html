 <p> In vitro enzymatic assays of recombinant SaTPS3. In vitro enzyme assays of recombinant SaTPS3 using FPP ( a) or GPP ( b) as the substrate in the presence of Mg 2+. The reaction products were analysed by GC-MS. The peaks marked with numbers were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in library data and a comparison of their retention index. Peaks in a: 1, cedrene, 2, unknown, 3, ( E)-β-farnesene, 4, unknown, 5, γ-bisabolene, 6, ( E)-nerolidol, 7, ( E,E)-farnesol. Peaks in b: 1, myrcene, 2, limonene, 3, unknown, 4, β-ocimene, 5, linalool, 6, α-terpineol, 7, geraniol. Mass spectra for the major products and corresponding authentic standards are shown, respectively. m/z, mass-to-charge ratio </p>
