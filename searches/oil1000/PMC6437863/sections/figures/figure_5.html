 <p> Subcellular localization of SaTPS1 to 3 in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Protoplasts were transiently transformed with SaTPS-YFP constructs or YFP vector using a modified polyethylene glycol method. YFP fluorescence was observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. Yellow fluorescence indicates SaTPS-YFP fusion protein signal. Blue signal indicates chlorophyll (Chl) autofluorescence and red signal indicates m-Cherry fluorescence. The merged images represent a digital combination of Chl autofluorescence, YFP fluorescent and m-Cherry protein fluorescence images. Fluorescence was excited for YFP at 514 nm, for Chl at 543 nm and for m-Cherry at 587 nm. Scale bar = 10 μm </p>
