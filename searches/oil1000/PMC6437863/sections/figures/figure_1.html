 <p> Sesquiterpenoid profile from different extracts. Sesquiterpenoids were identified against those in mass spectra reference libraries, NIST2005, NIST2005s, NIST2014, NIST2014s and FFNSC1.3 and a comparison of their retention indices. a, e: YL, young leaves, b, f: IW, immature wood, c, g: SW, sapwood, d, h, i: HW, heartwood. Segments ( e, f, g, h and i) of the GC profile ( a, b, c, d) are magnified in the right panel, respectively. Peaks: 1, α-santalene, 2, ( E)-α-bergamotene, 3, epi-β-santalene, 4, ( E)-β-farnesene, 5, β-santalene, 6, β-bisabolene, 7, unknown, 8, α-santalol, 9, α- trans-bergamotol, 10, α-santalol isomer, 11, epi-β-santalol, 12, unknown, 13, β-santalol, 14, β-santalol isomer, 15, lanceol. Peak numbers are indicated in order of elution from a HP-5MS column. IS, internal standard ( n-dodecane) </p>
