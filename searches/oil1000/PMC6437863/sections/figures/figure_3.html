 <p> Phylogenetic positioning of SaTPS protein products within representative samples of known plant TPS. The neighbour-joining tree was drawn using the MEGA 6 program from an alignment of full-length SaTPSs with other plant TPSs [ 75]. The seven TPS subfamilies a-g on the right-hand side are delimited based on the taxonomic distribution of the TPS families [ 15]. Bootstrap values from 1000 replicates were used to assess the robustness of the trees. Names of organism TPSs (NCBI Protein no.) can be retrieved from Additional file 1: Table S4 </p>
