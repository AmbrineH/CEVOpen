 <p> Transcript accumulation of SaTPS1 to 3 under multiple stresses in S. album. ( a- d) Six-month-old seedlings were sprayed with 1 mM MeJA or SA for 24 h. ( e- h) Six-month-old seedlings were exposed to 4°C, 38°C or high light intensity (approx. 250 μmol m − 2 s − 1) for 12 h. Three measurements were averaged from the results of three replicated experiments. L, leaves; S, stems; R, roots. Significant differences were analyzed by a student’s t-test and indicated as * P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01 and *** P &lt; 0.001 </p>
