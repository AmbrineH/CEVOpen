 <p> In vitro enzymatic assays of recombinant SaTPS2. In vitro enzyme assays of recombinant SaTPS2 using FPP ( a) or GPP ( b) as the substrate in the presence of Mg 2+. The reaction products were analysed by GC-MS. Peaks marked with numbers were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the library data and a comparison of their retention index. Peaks in a: 1, 7- epi-sesquithujene, 2, unknown, 3, α-bergamotene isomer, 4, ( E)-α-bergamotene, 5, ( E)-β-farnesene, 6, sesquisabinene, 7, unknown, 8, α-zingiberene, 9, α-bisabolene, 10, β-bisabolene, 11, γ-bisabolene, 12, unknown, 13, γ-bisabolene isomer, 14, β-bisabolol, 15, α-bisabolol. Peaks in b: 1, α-thujene, 2, α-pinene, 3, sabinene, 4, β-pinene, 5, myrcene, 6, limonene, 7, linalool, 8, α-terpineol, 9, geraniol. Mass spectra for the major products and corresponding authentic standards are shown on the right side of the figure, respectively. m/z, mass-to-charge ratio </p>
