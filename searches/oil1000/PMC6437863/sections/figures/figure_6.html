 <p> In vitro enzymatic assays of recombinant SaTPS1. In vitro enzyme assays of recombinant SaTPS1 using GPP ( a) and FPP ( b) as the substrate in the presence of Mg 2+. The reaction products were analyzed by GC-MS. The peaks marked with numbers were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the library data and comparison of their retention index. Peaks: 1, α-thujene, 2, α-pinene, 3, sabinene, 4, β-pinene, 5, myrcene, 6, limonene, 7, cineole, 8, β-ocimene, 9, linalool, 10, α-terpineol, 11, geraniol. Mass spectra for the major product and corresponding authentic standard are shown on the right side of the figure. m/z, mass-to-charge ratio </p>
