  <p class="p">Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of SaTPSs. The deduced amino acid sequences of 
   <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> genes were aligned using DNAMAN 6.0 (Lynnon Biosoft, San Ramon, CA, USA). The Asp-rich domain DDXXD, the RRX8W motif, and the NSE/DTE motif, which are highly conserved in plant TPSs and required for TPS activity, are indicated. The arrowhead denotes the predicted cleavage site of plastidial transit peptide of SaTPS1. Completely conserved residues are shaded in black, identical residues in dark grey, and similar residues in light grey. Dashes indicate gaps introduced to maximize sequence alignment
