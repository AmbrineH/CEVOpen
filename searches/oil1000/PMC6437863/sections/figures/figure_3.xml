  <p class="p">Phylogenetic positioning of 
   <italic class="italic">SaTPS</italic> protein products within representative samples of known plant TPS. The neighbour-joining tree was drawn using the MEGA 6 program from an alignment of full-length SaTPSs with other plant TPSs [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. The seven TPS subfamilies a-g on the right-hand side are delimited based on the taxonomic distribution of the TPS families [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Bootstrap values from 1000 replicates were used to assess the robustness of the trees. Names of organism TPSs (NCBI Protein no.) can be retrieved from Additional file
