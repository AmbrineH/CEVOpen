<p class="p">Completing and maintaining low-friction during a board range of temperatures is a challenging task for the tribology community. Fast developments in aviation, nuclear industry, materials processing, advanced machines and other areas of high technology have led to higher requirements for lubricants with low coefficients of friction with a broad temperature scope, because frictional parts are often exposed to cyclic environments with alternating conditions of room and high temperature application [

 <xref rid="B5-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Lubricants with fine tribological properties at various temperatures are largely required, because increased friction and wear would lead to inevitable losses of energy and materials, and subsequently reduce the efficiency of the mechanical system. In recent decades, to fulfill antifriction over a broader range of temperatures, the various types lubricating materials have appeared and been applied under special operating conditions. However, lubricating materials are highly sensitive to temperature, and perform the lubrication function within a narrow temperature interval [

 <xref rid="B7-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Fluid lubrication is always applied below 300 °C, and will lose proper lubrication quality above that temperature by reason of oxidative decomposition [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, can offer low-friction owing to their shear structure with a preferred easy shear parallel to the basal planes of the crystallites. Nevertheless, the maximum serve temperature is limited to 500 °C in air because of their inadequate oxidation resistance [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Although the fluoride, oxides, and rare earth components as efficient solid lubricants can serve even higher temperature, they are usually brittle and work ineffectively on lubricating at low temperatures [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. At present, despite intensive exploration and developmental achievements in the past decades, it is difficult or impossible for single kind of lubricant to realize the continuous friction-reduction requirement over a broad temperature range. At present, the self-lubricating bulk composite materials and self-adaptive lubricating composite layer have been applied as a solution for the lubrication problem over a wide range of temperatures via multi ingredient design, and utilize the lubricating feature of the different ingredients at various temperature stages to minimize friction. However, the mechanical properties of bulk materials are deteriorated when excessive lubricating phases existed. The lubricating layers are expensive to prepare and are difficult to maintain. Furthermore, the solid materials always possess a relatively high friction coefficient at the low temperature range. All these defects have limited the development of self-lubricating bulk materials and lubricating layers over a wide temperature range. Therefore, it is an effective and practical measure to maintain lubrication covering a broader temperature range to use the multi-components hybrid mode with fluid lubrication for the low-temperature stage and solid lubrication for the high-temperature zone. The design and preparation of solid lubricant is vital to successful antifriction in the hybrid mode, since it should produce friction-reduction at the moment of oil oxidative decomposition, and keep lowering the friction over a range of high temperatures. In addition, it is key to ensure that the solid lubricant does not deteriorate the friction-reducing and antiwear nature of the base stock at low temperatures.
