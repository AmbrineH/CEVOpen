The purpose of this work was to achieve a comprehensive insight on the behavior of magnesium perrhenate as lubricating additive, with special emphasis on the role of ambient temperature on the characteristics of the friction-reducing layer and the relevant friction behavior of the coupling. Meanwhile, the synergy effect and mechanism of PAO containing Mg(ReO
