<p class="p">As mentioned above, many trials have been made to discover ways of feasible alteration of solid lubricating materials. Double metal oxides as inorganic salts are potential candidates for consideration in virtue of their low Mohs hardness compared with that of single oxides and thermal softening that make them shear susceptible at the high temperature range. Additionally, they are also likely to be promising candidates to solve the challenge of high-temperature friction reduction owing to their chemical stability in air. Many literature reports show that some chromates, molybdates, tungstates, and vanadates have attracted much attention and been applied as high temperature solid lubricants via direct preparation methods or tribochemical reaction over the course of friction at elevated temperatures [

All these double metal oxides provide fantastic lubrication performances at elevated temperatures, and give a guide as to the usage of them to explore boundary lubrication. In addition, as alkaline earth metal element, magnesium or magnesium compounds have been widely used as lubricating additives to aid friction reduction during the friction process. It is well known that talcum powder has the lowest Mohs hardness in nature, and this contains plenty of the magnesium element. The research outcomes on the lubricating results of composites containing magnesium element are impressive. Qi et al. synthesized magnesium hexasilicate and a serpentine compound used as oil additive, and the tribological properties at elevated temperatures were investigated. Both of the magnesium compounds can generate protective layers with metal matrix, thereby reducing the friction [
