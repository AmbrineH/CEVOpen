<p class="p">It was clear that almost all the energy expended in the process of friction emerged in the form of the heat across the contact interface. The friction heat induced temperature rise in the rubbing pairs and the oil mixtures. Thus, the smaller energy expended resulted in less temperature increase. As a result,

Note that the base oil with 0.5 wt% magnesium perrhenate additive produced the minimum temperature rise compared to the remaining specimens. This was similar to the results of the friction coefficients and WSD results. Furthermore, the temperature rise results demonstrated the excellent tribological property of the Mg(ReO
