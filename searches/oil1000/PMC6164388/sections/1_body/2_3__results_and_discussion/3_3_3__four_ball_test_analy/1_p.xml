The average value of the friction coefficient was 0.063 at an optimal content of 0.5 wt%, which was reduced by 30.8% in contrast to the value of base oil (0.091). The downward trend of average friction coefficients could have resulted from the generation of deposited tribofilm made up of long-chain molecules from base oil and added Mg(ReO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive in PAO resulted in a remarkable decrease of WSD values, and the smallest WSD of 445 μm was attained at a content of 0.5 wt%, which was reduced by 28.5% in contrast to that in the lubrication state of PAO only (622 μm). Then, the WSD values increased with the further rise of additive concentration above 0.5 wt%. The reason for the improving friction-reducing capacity of PAO rested on the fact that the Mg(ReO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive could be absorbed on the interface to produce a protective film under high contact load, thereby avoiding direct contact of the friction pairs and minimizing friction. Above the optimal content, the WSD values were slightly increased associated with additive concentration increase, which was ascribed to the fact that the agglomeration of the excess Mg(ReO

 <xref rid="B27-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. This caused the increase in friction, even regional destruction of the protective layer, and thereby led to relatively high wear aggravation with excessive additive concentration.
