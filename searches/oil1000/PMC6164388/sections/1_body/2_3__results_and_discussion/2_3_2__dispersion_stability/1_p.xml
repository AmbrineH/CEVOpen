 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive in PAO oil, the transmittance of base oil with diverse additive concentrations along with the time change are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01754-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The transmittance of all the test specimens declined with increasing contents of Mg(ReO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive, indicating that a certain mass of Mg(ReO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive was suspended in the PAO oil with the aid of SA. Additionally, the transmittance attained slight variation and achieved a stable tendency over time, indicating that Mg(ReO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> could be well suspended in the hydrophilicâ€“lipophilic balance environment modified by addition of SA.
