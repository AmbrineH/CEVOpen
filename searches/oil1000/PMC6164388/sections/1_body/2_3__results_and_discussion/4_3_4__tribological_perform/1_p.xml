The base oil exhibited a favorable friction-reducing nature with coefficients of friction being in the 0.11 to 0.15 range below 200 °C. However, a distinct increase in friction coefficients of PAO above 350 °C was due to oxidative decomposition, which made the PAO base oil lose its lubricating service purpose. In addition, the carbon residue generated from the high temperature environments would result in increasing wear. Thus, the friction coefficients of pure PAO attained relatively high values of 0.47 at 450 °C and 0.46 at 600 °C, respectively. Additionally, the average values of the friction coefficient of base oil with added surfactants were similar to that of pure oil under test conditions, which illustrated that the added surfactants did not influence the antifriction function of PAO oil for the whole service processes. In comparison with base oil, the added Mg(ReO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive could slightly enhance the lubricating property of base oil below 200 °C. The friction-reducing effect under ball-on-disc configuration was not as obvious as that under the four-ball test, which is related to the different friction test parameters and experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the friction coefficient of base oil containing Mg(ReO
