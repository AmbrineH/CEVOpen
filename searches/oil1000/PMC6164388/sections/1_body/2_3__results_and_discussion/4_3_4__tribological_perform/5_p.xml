The O1s was composed of three peaks, and the main peak appeared at 530.4 eV, which could be related to oxygen in the organic matter. An objective peak located at 531.5 eV could be ascribed to natural oxides from the alloy, suggesting that the metallic elements suffered oxidation in the test process. Also, another peak at 532.3 eV associated with oxygen in the ReO

Additionally, the Cr2p peak located at 576.7 eV was attributed to the generation of chromium oxide. The existence of native oxide of superalloy showed that the native metallic elements oxidized and developed oxides on the rubbing surface. Nevertheless, these metallic oxides offered little lubrication function at elevated temperature condition, because they are brittle and easily removed under cyclic stress. The XPS analysis revealed that the added Mg(ReO
