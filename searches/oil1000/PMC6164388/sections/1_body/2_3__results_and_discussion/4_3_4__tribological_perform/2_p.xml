The worn track width values of superalloy with pure base oil lubrication were the largest among all the test lubricants in the range of 350–600 °C, suggesting that the lubricating function of base oil deteriorated in the elevated temperature environment. Meanwhile, the oil with added SA possessed the similar values of worn track width and obtained the same trend at identical temperature conditions. In contrast, the mean width values of wear track under oil with 0.5 wt% Mg(ReO

The reason for this might be that a protective layer containing Mg(ReO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive was formed on the friction surface by deposition and adhesion to the contact interface under the mixing effect of stress and frictional heating, which was sheared easily and could be restrained in direct contact between rubbing pairs, and thus mitigate the wear of the metal surface. In general, the increasing worn track width resulted from the lager plastic deformation of the worn surface [

Furthermore, the deformation due to friction and the succeeding microstructure variation below the contact interface were responsible for the friction coefficients increasing.
