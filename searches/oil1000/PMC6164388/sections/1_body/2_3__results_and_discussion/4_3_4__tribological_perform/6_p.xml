 <sub class="sub">7</sub>, which have ionic potential of 3.0 and 12.5, respectively. Generally, the cations in oxides are in separated state and fully blocked by surrounding anions on account of large difference in ionic potential, thereby the highly screened cations hardly interact with neighboring cations [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Consequently, the double oxides were fairly soft and easy to be sheared at the high temperature range. Additionally, the affinity of ionic species to generate stable compounds improved as the difference in ionic potential increased, and reducing the attractive effect between sliding surfaces led to lower adhesive force across the rubbing interface. Over the temperature range, the Mg(ReO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> compound as lubricating additive, could match oil well without worsening the antifriction and thermal stability of the base oil. Moreover, it could generate a highly compressive layer with natural oxides from the Ni-based alloy on the interface under such an elevated temperature range to sustain a certain amount of applied load. Thus, the magnesium perrhenate could be considered as a promising lubricating oil additive for a broad temperature range application.
