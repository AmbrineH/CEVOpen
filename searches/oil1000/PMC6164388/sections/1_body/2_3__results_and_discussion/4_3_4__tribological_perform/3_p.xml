 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01754-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref> shows the worn surfaces of superalloy disc under diverse samples lubrication at various temperatures. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01754-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>a, that the micro-grooves and detachments of the deformed surface appear at 350 °C, indicating that the base oil has lost lubricating function. Additionally, small pits and some debris were also observed on the worn surface, which illustrates that the main wear mechanism was micro-plough. At 450 °C, severe deformation and delaminations evidently emerged on the rubbing surface, which was responsible for the increased coefficient of friction at that temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01754-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>b). As the temperature reached 600 °C, the worn track displayed severe damage with evident appearance of plastic deformation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01754-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>c). In addition, delamination and plowed grooves existed on the worn surface. This indicated that the major wear mechanism of the rubbing pair was characterized by adhesive wear. The EDS results after friction tests with pure PAO at different temperatures showed that nickel, iron, chromium, oxygen elements existed on the worn surface, as well as less amounts of elements such as carbon. Especially, the contents of oxygen on the worn surface increased with the rise of temperature, which was attributed to diffusion promotion of the oxygen in pace with the elevated temperature. This indicated that the oxygen easily reacted with the native elements of the superalloy, and diffused towards the worn surface to form an oxide layer. Nevertheless, this oxide layer was hard and brittle and was easily removed by the shearing force in the process of the friction test [
 <xref rid="B29-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Consequently, it was hard to develop a stable protective layer with the function of oxidative inhibition, avoiding direct contact of the rubbing pair, and making no contribution to friction-reduction. In contrast, the worn surface under PAO containing Mg(ReO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive lubrication was much smoother than that lubricated by pure oil at 350 °C, and a continuous layer was covered on the metal surface with fine wear debris, which was ascribed to generation of protective layer that could effectively minimize the wear of the counterface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01754-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>d). To investigate the composition distribution on the worn surface, EDS analysis was conducted. The result suggested that the major elements appearing were Mg, Re, O, Ni, Fe, Cr, et al., which were ingredients of the Mg(ReO
