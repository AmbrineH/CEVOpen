<p class="p">The four-ball wear tests were evaluated on the WWM-1 four-ball tester (Shunmao Instrument Co. Ltd., Jinan, China) at 392 N (the mean hertz contact pressure was around 1230 MPa) and 1450 rpm at room temperature for 30 min according to the ASTM D4172 standard [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-11-01754" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The test balls with a diameter of 12.7 mm in this experiment were made up of Cr alloy steel, having a hardness between 59â€“61 HRC. Corresponding tests were carried out for every concentration and three repeat surveys were executed, and the mean friction coefficient values and wear scar diameters (WSD) of the lower ball are reported in this paper. The original and final temperatures of the oil mixtures were detected by a thermometer attached to the four-ball tester. The friction coefficients were automatically recorded by computer using a data-acquiring system linked to the tester, and a VHX-1000E super depth field optical microscope (Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan) was employed to measure the WSDs. The surface morphologies of wear scars were observed by an FEI INSPECT-F50 SEM instrument.
