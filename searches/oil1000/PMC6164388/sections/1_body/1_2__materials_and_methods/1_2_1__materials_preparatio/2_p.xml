<p class="p">The PAO6 (Hongcheng Chemical Co. Ltd., Shenyang, China) was chosen as base oil due to its high oxidative resistance temperature, excellent viscosity-temperature characteristics, high flash point, and low-volatility. The typical physical parameters of PAO6 aree listed in

Then, a weight of 0.05 g of surfactants (SA, 0.045 g of OP10: 0.005 g of CTAB) were added into the 5 g PAO oil using ultrasonic oscillation method for 30 min to reduce surface tension of the base oil and establish a hydrophilic–lipophilic balance state. Afterwards, the supersaturated aqueous solution was added into the base oil containing SA and continuously stirred at a rotation velocity of 1500 rpm for 10 min at a temperature of 140 °C in an oil bath till no obvious bubble (boiling water) was released. The base oils blended with various contents of Mg(ReO
