<p class="p">The phase composition was investigated via an X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) tester with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1546 nm) at a scanning speed of 5°/min in the 2θ range of 10–90°. The micro-morphology of the synthesized product was observed using a FEI INSPECT 50 scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry (DTA/TG,) analysis was determined in the ambient atmosphere with a SETSYS Evolution18 thermal analyzer (SETARAM Corporation, Caluire, France). The rate of heating addition was 10 °C/min under a flow of air with speed of 30 mL/min. To evaluate the suspended stability of magnesium perrhenate in the base oil, a UV-3900 visible–ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used to investigate the transmittances of PAO containing Mg(ReO
