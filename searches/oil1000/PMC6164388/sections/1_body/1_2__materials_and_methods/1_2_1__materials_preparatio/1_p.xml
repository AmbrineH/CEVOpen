<p class="p">The raw materials used in synthesizing the new product were rhenium powders (&gt;99.999% in purity, Zhonglai Science and Technology Co. Ltd., Changsha, China), hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 30% concentration, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) and magnesium hydroxide powders (&gt;99.5% in purity, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). At the beginning, the 0.003 mol rhenium powders were weighed, then added rapidly into 20 mL hydrogen peroxide solution. The hybrid compounds were continuously stirred and lots of bubbles were emitted, while the solution color changed from grey to transparent. The perrhenic acid (HReO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) was continued until free of bubbles. In the subsequent step, 0.131 g of magnesium hydroxide powders were added to freshly prepared HReO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution with constant mixing. At the end of the reaction, the lower sediment was discarded using qualitative filter paper. Then, the obtained reactant was maintained in the water bath at a temperature of 65 °C until a white layer of crystalline material was generated. The resulting product (Mg(ReO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was removed from the water bath and dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at a temperature of 200 °C.
