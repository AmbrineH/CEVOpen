<p class="p">The microstructure and morphologies of the wear track were characterized using an FEI INSPECT-F50 SEM instrument. The ESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fish Scientific Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) using the Al KÎ± line as excitation source at a pass energy of 50 eV, and binding energy of C1s (284.6 eV) was used as reference. The worn track widths of the lower discs were measured by using a VHX-1000E super depth field optical microscope.</p>
