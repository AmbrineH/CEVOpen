 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ball with a diameter of 6.35 mm (roughness &lt; 0.02 μm) and a GH4169 Ni-based alloy disc (chemical composition: ≤0.08 wt% Carbon, ≤1.0 wt% Cobalt, 2.8–3.3 wt% Molybdenum, 0.3–0.7 wt% Aluminum, 0.75–1.15 wt% Titanium, 17–21 wt% Chromium, 50–55 wt% Nickel and balance iron) with a size of Ø50 mm × 4 mm were used as the friction pair materials for the tribological testing. The GH4169 superalloy disc was ground continuously by different types of abrasive paper and polished with grinding agent to obtain a surface roughness of 0.1–0.2 μm. Both the ball and the disc were ultrasonically cleaned for 30 min by acetone to remove contaminants before the friction test. The tests were carried out at 25 °C, 200 °C, 350 °C, 450 °C, and 600 °C, and each test was held for 8 min. A load of 5 N (the mean hertz contact pressure was around 500 MPa) and a liner velocity of 0.08 m/s were applied for testing parameters. Each of the work conditions was tested three times to guarantee the repeatability and reproducibility of the data, and the mean values of the friction coefficients were reported.
