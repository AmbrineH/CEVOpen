    <sub class="sub">2</sub> compound used as lubricating additive significantly improved the lubricating base oil in the condition of the four-ball test. The coefficient of friction and WSD were reduced by 30.8% and 28.5%, respectively, when the optimum concentration of 0.5 wt% Mg(ReO

   <p class="p">The Mg(ReO

    <sub class="sub">2</sub> compound could promote the antifriction property of the base oil at a relatively low temperature and possessed a superb lubrication function at high temperature conditions. The added Mg(ReO
    <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
    <sub class="sub">2</sub> was deposited on the worn surface and generated a protective layer that improved the contact state of the rubbing interface. This layer formed at the elevated temperature range was mainly made up of Mg(ReO
    <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
    <sub class="sub">2</sub> compound and some natural oxides from the metal matrix, while the appearance of the complex layer could effectively prevent direct contact between rubbing pairs. The Mg(ReO
    <sub class="sub">4</sub>)
    <sub class="sub">2</sub> additive had a leading role in friction-reduction as a result of its higher thermal stability and maintaining a shear-susceptible structure with increasing temperature.

   <p class="p">The established original characterizations and tribological testing results suggested a tremendous potential for blending proper magnesium perrhenate additive and PAO base oil to obtain a continuous and effective lubrication function over a broad temperature range.</p>
