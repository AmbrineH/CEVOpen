 <p class="p">Magnesium perrhenate used as a lubricating additive was prepared by an aqueous solution method in this paper, and was suspended in a base oil poly alpha olefin (PAO6) with the aid of surface active agents (SA). The thermal stability of the mixed oil with/without magnesium perrhenate and surface active agents was investigated by thermogravimetry testing. The influences of magnesium perrhenate as solid lubricating additive on the extreme pressure performance and the friction-reducing properties over a wide temperature range of the mixed lubricants were determined by four-ball tests and ball-on-disc frictional tests for the commercially available silicon nitride ball and a Ni-base superalloy frictional pair. The results revealed that the added magnesium perrhenate did not obviously affect the thermostability and oxidation resistance of the base oil. Meanwhile, it minimized the coefficients of friction and wear scar diameter to a certain extent in the four-ball experimental conditions. Ball-on-disc rubbing tests suggested the mixed oil had a similar lubricating performance to the base oil below the decomposition temperature point. The most significant advancement was the impressive antifriction improvement at the high temperature range, while the friction coefficients of the oil containing magnesium perrhenate compound were obviously below that of the base stock. This better tribological performance of the mixed lubricant was attributed to the native shear susceptible property and chemical stability of magnesium perrhenate under high temperature conditions, which could form an effective durable and stable antifriction layer with the oxides from the superalloy matrix, thereby decreasing the friction in the high-temperature environment.</p>
