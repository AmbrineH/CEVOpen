  <p class="p">Bacterial- time kill curve. Zerumbone was tested for antimicrobial activity on bacterial-kill kinetics. 
   <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> were grown in BHI broth + tween 20 10% (control) or along with graded concentrations of zerumbone at 37 °C for 72 h in anaerobic conditions. Samples were collected at different time intervals to estimate bacterial kill kinetics (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and growth reduction (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>), by spectrophotometry analysis and CFU counts. Numbers inside of bars at (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) and (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) figures means percent reduction. Results are representative of three independent experiments and data are expressed in mean ± SD. The interquartile range of each data is indicated by error bars
