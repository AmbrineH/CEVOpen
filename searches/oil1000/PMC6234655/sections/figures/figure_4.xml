  <p class="p">Antimicrobial activity (MIC and MBC) of zerumbone against 
   <italic class="italic">S. mutans.</italic> Bacterial inoculum (1 × 10
   <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL) was treated with different concentrations of zerumbone and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in anaerobic conditions. After incubation, the bacterial growth was verified by turbidity measurements using spectrophotometer. The results are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate and the values are shown in mean ± SD. OD: optical density; MIC: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; MBC: Minimum bactericidal concentration
