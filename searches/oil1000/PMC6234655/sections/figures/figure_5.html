 <p> Bacterial- time kill curve. Zerumbone was tested for antimicrobial activity on bacterial-kill kinetics. S. mutans were grown in BHI broth + tween 20 10% (control) or along with graded concentrations of zerumbone at 37 °C for 72 h in anaerobic conditions. Samples were collected at different time intervals to estimate bacterial kill kinetics ( a) and growth reduction ( b and c), by spectrophotometry analysis and CFU counts. Numbers inside of bars at ( b) and ( c) figures means percent reduction. Results are representative of three independent experiments and data are expressed in mean ± SD. The interquartile range of each data is indicated by error bars </p>
