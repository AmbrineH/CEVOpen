<p id="Par34" class="p">Indeed, zerumbone has been tested against a wide range of microorganisms and have showed good antibacterial activity, mainly against gram positive bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. But, until now, there is no report describing the antimicrobial activity of the zerumbone or its analogs against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>. Hasan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] demonstrated that extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale</italic>, species that belongs to same genus and family of bitter ginger, has anti-
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> action with MIC value of 256 μg/mL, effect similar to the one observed in this study. However, unlike our study, no compound was isolated or purified to determine which biomolecules were responsible for the observed antimicrobial activity. Generally, the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber zerumbet</italic> shows in its constitution a range of zerumbone concentration starting from 12 to 73% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, the essential oil obtained in our study showed 87,93% of zerumbone, which was raised to 98% after purification and recrystallization process using a method patented by our group (n
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> PI-0505343-9/28/11/2007). This degree of purity is greater than the ones described elsewhere, which allow us to better characterize the zerumbone antimicrobial action [
