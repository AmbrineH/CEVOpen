<p id="Par37" class="p">Altogether, this study demonstrates the antimicrobial activity of zerumbone against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, showing that its toxic activity selectively targets bacterium, but not displays any cytotoxic effect against the normal mammalian cells at concentrations tested. Nonetheless, further studies using in vitro and in vivo models are needed to better determine the zerumbone effectiveness and safety as antimicrobial agent in the context of prophylaxis and treatment of cariogenic infections.
