<p id="Par35" class="p">Since zerumbone exhibited efficient antimicrobial activity, we next evaluated the speed of cidal activity. The effectiveness observed was concentration and time-dependent, although both concentrations tested showed similar results. The intensity of zerumbone antimicrobial activity was pronounced during the logarithmic growth phase. After 24 h of bacterial exposure to 250 and 500 μg/mL zerumbone concentrations, viable bacterial cells were reduced to 65.46 and 70.62%, respectively. According to Jones et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] when an antimicrobial agent reduces the bacterial colonies around 70% within 24 h time period, it can be considered as a strong candidate for treating bacterial infections. However, the maximum cidal activity of zerumbone was reached at stationary phase, suggesting the possibility of two mechanism of zerumbone activity, different from the most antibiotic agents that require cell division or active metabolism for the drug’s killing activity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Thus, an antibiotic agent that still shows bactericidal activity under growth-limited conditions may be very advantageous, since the biofilm-associated microorganisms, such as

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the antibacterial mechanism of action of zerumbone.
