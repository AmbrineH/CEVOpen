<p id="Par36" class="p">Beyond the determination of the optimum antibacterial concentration, it is also important to guarantee the cytotoxicity safety of the bioactive substances against normal mammalian cells, if the ultimate goal is to use it as a main raw material to produce new drugs. Usually, finding the balance between effectiveness and safety of a biomolecule is very hard mission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Our findings indicated that the zerumbone may not be cytotoxic to normal mammalian cells, since the exposure of Vero cells to different concentrations of zerumbone cause no considerable toxic effects at the concentrations tested. Even after 48 h of zerumbone treatment, no substantial toxic effect was observed, other than a low cytotoxicity evidenced at 100 μg/mL concentration (reduction of 13% of cell proliferation). However, it is imperative to consider that the susceptibility of mammalian cells tend to be greater in the MTT test than in vivo situation, because of the direct exposure of the cells to the biomolecules without any type of variants happening in vivo, such as route of administration and topical absorption, which may influence or even though decrease the cytotoxicity effect demonstrated in vitro [
