<p id="Par22" class="p">The antimicrobial activity of zerumbone was evaluated by estimation of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) using microdilution method according to the guidelines of the Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. The working stock solution of zerumbone was prepared in polyethylene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) under vigorous magnetic stirring system to assure homogeneity, as previously described [
