<p id="Par23" class="p">After incubation, the bacterial growth was evaluated by measuring the turbidity in each well through spectrophotometric analysis (600 nm). Subsequently, an aliquot of 50 μL of each well was collected and seeded on plates containing BHI agar and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in anaerobic conditions. Next, the plates were analyzed for the presence/absence of bacteria in order to estimate the MIC and MBC. The MIC was estimated according to lowest concentration of zerumbone that inhibits the bacterial growth. The MBC was assessed based on the concentration that kills all viable bacterial cells and therefore reveals no visible bacterial growth on the plates. The number of surviving cells (CFU/mL) was determined through the direct-plate counting technique performed individually by two skilled technicians. The limit of detection used in all tests was 10 CFU. An estimated count was provided in case of countable colonies were presented below this limit, as previous reported [
