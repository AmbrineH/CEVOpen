 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Firstly, bacterial suspensions were prepared by inoculation of colonies into a tube containing 3 mL Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, followed by incubation at orbital shaking of 150 RPM for 72 h at 37 °C in anaerobic conditions, as previously described [

 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/ mL was used in the assays.
