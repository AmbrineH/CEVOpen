<p id="Par18" class="p">The extraction of the essential oil (EO) was carried out in the Thematic Laboratory of Chemistry and Natural Products at INPA. The EO was obtained through the hydrodistillation of rhizomes. Briefly, after the identification, cleaning and disinfection, the material was crushed and dried at room temperature. Clevenger apparatus adapted with a round-bottom flask of 2l volume was used for distillation of OE from the crushed material diluted in distilled water in a proportion 1:4. The extraction was done during 6Â h starting at boiling point. Afterward, the EO was collected from the condenser and stored in amber flasks at room temperature. All system was protected from light using aluminum foil. The OE yield was estimated by calculating the ratio between the oil mass and the feed mass.</p>
