<p id="Par26" class="p">The cytotoxicity activity of zerumbone was determined using the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay as previously described with few modifications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Summarily, Vero cells line (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> per well) were cultured into 96-well plate containing 0.2 mL of DMEM medium (with 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin and amphotericin B) per well, in atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37 °C for 24 h. After formation of sub-confluent monolayer, the cells were treated with zerumbone (25 μg/mL; 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL) and incubated again at the same conditions above mentioned for 24 and 48 h. For this assay, crystals of zerumbone were diluted in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) because of its low aqueous solubility. Thus, the maximum concentration of zerumbone containing safe percentage of DMSO (&lt; 1%) to the cells was 100 μg/mL. Sterile PBS was used as positive control and DMSO 100% as negative control. Subsequently, the medium was removed from all wells and 10 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL in sterile PBS) diluted in 100 μL of DMEM medium (without phenol red to avoid misinterpretation) was added into the wells and incubated in atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37 °C for 4 h. After that, the MTT was removed and 50 μL of MTT lysis buffer were added to each well followed for gently homogenization to dissolve the formazan crystals and incubated again for 10 min at the same conditions mentioned earlier. Optical densities of samples were measured using a microplate reader at wavelength of 570 nm. The relative viability of cells was estimated using the following equation: (A570 of treated sample)/(A570 of untreated sample) × 100. All tests were done in triplicate.
