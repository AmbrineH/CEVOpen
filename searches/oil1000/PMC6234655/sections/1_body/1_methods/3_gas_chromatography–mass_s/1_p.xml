 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Briefly, the investigation of essential oil composition was carried out using Hewlett Packard HP/série 6890 GC SITEM PLUS gas chromatographer (6511 Bunker Lake Blvd. Ramsey, Minnesota, 55303 USA) with an analytical HP-5MS 5% phenylmethylsiloxane capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d, film thickness 0,25 μm). It was operated an electron ionization system with ionization energy of 70 V. The analyses were conducted using helium and nitrogen gases at 2 mL/min with purity percentage of 99.999%. It was injected 1 μL in splitless mode, in 1:20 ratio of hexannic solution. The oven was programmed at controlled temperature between 60 and 240 °C, raising 3 °C/min and kept at 250 °C for 10 min. Temperature of mass transfer and injection were established at 220 °C and 290 °C, respectively. The chemical constituents of essential oil analyzed were expressed as relative percentage by peak area normalization. The identification of the OE constituents was done by calculating the retention time obtained in the analyzes of GC-MS, correlating them with the retention times of the n-alkanes (C9-C30). The indices were compared with the data available in the NIST / WILEY library [
