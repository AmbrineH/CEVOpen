<p id="Par25" class="p">An aliquot of 100 μL was removed at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h time intervals to determine the bacterial growth by measuring turbidity through spectrophotometric analysis (600 nm). Subsequently, the aliquots were serially diluted in 0.85% of sterile saline solution, seeded in BHI agar and then incubated at the conditions set out above. The viable number of bacterial cells was estimated by counting CFU and multiplying the results by dilution factors. Means of duplicate colony counts were taken. To build the time-kill curve, the log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> CFU/mL versus time over 72 h was plotted. The decrease of 99.9% (≥ 3 log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub>) of the total number of CFU/mL in the original inoculum was used to estimate the bactericidal activity. The assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times to confirm the reproducibility of results.
