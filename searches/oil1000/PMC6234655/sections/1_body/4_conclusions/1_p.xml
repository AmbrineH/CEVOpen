<p id="Par38" class="p">In summary, this study suggests that zerumbone represents a bioactive substance to be explored by phytopharmaceutical industry in the drug formulations, to prevent and treat cariogenic infections, because this biomolecule showed antimicrobial activity against the main etiological agent of tooth decay, 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans.</italic> Although the cytotoxicity safety of zerumbone in mammalian cells (at concentrations tested) and its antibacterial action at both log and stationary phases support its potential use as antibacterial agent against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> infection, additional studies are necessary to better characterize the zerumbone mechanism of action, efficacy and safety in the scenario of cariogenic disease.
