<p id="Par28" class="p">The yield of the essential oil obtained was 5%. The EO showed to be constituted mainly by sesquiterpene zerumbone compound, according to GC-MS analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). A percentage of 87,93% of zerumbone was detected among the nineteen others chemical constituents. The purification and recrystallization processes applied to EO resulted in a zerumbone crystal with 98% of purity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). These crystals were used in all subsequent tests.
