<p id="Par29" class="p">The zerumbone substance tested in this study demonstrated antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> ATCC 35668, showing a MIC value of 250 μg/mL and MBC of 500 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S1). The time-kill curve assay corroborates the antimicrobial activity of zerumbone. This biomolecule displayed more intense antibacterial activity in the time interval 12–48 h, corresponding to log phase of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> growth curve (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>: Figure S2). Within 12 h of bacterial exposure to 250 μg/mL and 500 μg/mL of zerumbone concentrations, viable bacterial cells were reduced in 45.55% and 56,29%, respectively, in comparison to the original inoculum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). After 24 h of exposure, the reduction was more pronounced with 65.46% (250 μg/mL) and 70.62% (500 μg/mL) of bacterial cells death (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">c</xref>). Finally, the zerumbone showed its maximum action in the interval of 48–72 h, reducing 94.78% of bacterial colonies at concentration of 250 μg/mL and killing all bacteria at the concentration of 500 μg/mL (Fig.
