<p id="Par30" class="p">The MMT assay demonstrated that the biomolecule zerumbone had no considerable cytotoxicity effect up to 100 μg/mL. At concentrations 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL the percentages of cell viability were 100, 97 and 92%, respectively, after 24 h treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The cell viability slightly changed at concentration 50 μg/mL (93%) and 100 μg/mL (87%) after 48 h treatment. The results clearly show that the zerumbone has no cytotoxic effect on normal mammalian cells at the concentrations tested.
