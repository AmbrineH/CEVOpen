<p id="Par16" class="p">Chemicals agents such as chlorexidin and others phenolic compounds are available and can be used to prevent tooth decay, but long term use of these compounds may result in side effects like loss of taste, metallic taste in mouth, dental pigmentation, diarrhea and oral burning sensation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. In this context, biomolecules isolated from plants have been suggested as alternative therapeutics over synthetic chemical agents for prevention of tooth decay, because of their few or no side effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Hence, the main goal of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the zerumbone obtained from rhizomes of 
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber zerumbet</italic> (L.) Smith against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic>, the main etiological agent of tooth decay.
