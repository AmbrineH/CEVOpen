 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. The cariogenic potential displayed by this bacterium is due to its ability to produce acid (acidogenic) from dietary carbohydrate, capacity to survive in low-pH environments (aciduric) and, especially, due to its great ability to adhere onto the tooth surfaces, which makes
