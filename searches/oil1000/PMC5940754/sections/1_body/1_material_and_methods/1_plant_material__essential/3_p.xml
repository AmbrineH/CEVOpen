<p id="Par8" class="p">The GC-FID analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus instrument (Kyoto, Japan), with a flame ionization detector (FID), and a CP-Sil column 8 CB with methylpolysiloxane as the stationary phase (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0. 25 μm (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, USA). The injection split ratio was 1:50 flow division throughout the run (60.3 min), and nitrogen was used as carrier gas with constant flow of 1.5 mL/min, an injector temperature of 250 °C, and a detector temperature of 260 °C.</p>
