 </sup>, our 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> bioassays with this essential oil induced necrotic and apoptotic cell death on lepidopteran cultured cells. These effects might be derived from the actions of terpenes (e.g., the monoterpene Î²-myrcene) present in the essential oil. Terpenes generally allow the essential oil to diffuse through the cell membrane, causing not only cell membrane alterations but also uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer inhibition
