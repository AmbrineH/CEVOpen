<p class="p">Sets of 20 seeds each with five replicates per treatment were homogenously distributed in Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) between two layers of filter paper (Whatman No.1) moistened with 4 mL of distilled water and with 0 (control), 0.125, 0.250, 0.5, and 1 µL/mL of ginger and turmeric essential oils. Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated in an Equitec EGCS 301 3SHR model germination chamber, according to previous assays [

To evaluate the herbicidal activity of the essential oils, the number of germinated seeds was counted and compared with that of untreated seedlings. Emergence of the radicle (≥ 1 mm) was used as an index of germination and seedling length (hypocotyl and/or radicle) data were recorded after 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days in each replicate.
