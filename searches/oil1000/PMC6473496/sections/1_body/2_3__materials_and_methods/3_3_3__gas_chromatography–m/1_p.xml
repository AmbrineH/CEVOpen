<p class="p">GC–MS analysis was carried out using a 5977A Agilent mass spectrometer and a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B) apparatus equipped with an Agilent HP-5MSi (30 m long and 0.25 mm i.d. with 0.25 µm film thickness) capillary column (95% dimethylpolysiloxane/5% diphenyl). The column temperature program was 60 ᵒC for a duration of 5 min, with 3 ᵒC/min increases to 180 ᵒC, then 20 ᵒC/min increases to 280 ᵒC, which was maintained for 10 min. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Split mode injection (ratio 1:30) was employed. Mass spectra were taken over the m/z range 30–650 with an ionizing voltage of 70 eV. The resulting individual compounds were identified by MS and their identity was confirmed by comparison of their Kovat’s retention index calculated using co-chromatographed standard hydrocarbons relative to C
