<p class="p">Turmeric essential oil, with the exception of the radicle elongation of 
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic>, significantly inhibited both hypocotyl and radicle growth of the selected weeds at all doses (0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 1 µL/mL) assayed. The hypocotyl development was reduced without significant differences between doses applied to reach percentages of 56.55% (
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic>), 40.45% (
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic>), 39.33% (

 <xref rid="plants-08-00059-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The radicle elongation of 
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. crus-galli</italic> was significantly reduced at all doses of turmeric essential oil, reaching 36.74% and 44.41%, respectively, at the highest dose tested. 
 <italic class="italic">C. selloana</italic> was again the most sensitive species to turmeric essential oil with percentages of radicle growth inhibition of 77.32%, 81.44%, 86.08%, and 99.74% at the doses of 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 1 µL/mL, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">N. glauca</italic> reached a percentage of 51.42% at the highest dose applied.
