<p class="p">Ginger essential oil also considerably influenced the radicle progress of the five selected weeds. The radicle development of 
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic> was significantly reduced by 57.22% and 86.06% relative to the control after the application of ginger essential oil at 0.5 and 1 µL/mL, respectively; this was similar to 
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic>, whose radicle enlargement was decreased at these doses between 60.23% and 72.36% (
