<p class="p">Promising results were obtained with turmeric essential oil against the food crops tested. Neither seed germination nor the hypocotyl growth of tomato, cucumber, and rice were significantly affected by the application of turmeric essential oil at any dose (0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 1 µL/mL) (

 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> spp. like 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic> have been shown to inhibit the seed germination of lettuce and tomato in a dose-dependent manner (0.00%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00%) as well as to delay their growth, damaging the root in particular. These results are due to the different chemical compositions of these essential oils, with ar-turmerone (38.7 ± 0.8%), β-turmerone (18.6 ± 0.6%), and α-turmerone (14.2 ± 0.9%) being the main compounds in the turmeric essential oil here analyzed (
