These results agree with those of previous work in which seed germination of soybean was not inhibited by the aqueous extract of ginger rhizome at the doses assayed, whereas the hypocotyl and radicle length were reduced at the higher doses applied [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. On the other hand, neither seed germination nor the hypocotyl growth of cucumber and rice were affected by ginger essential oil at any dose (0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 1 µL/mL) assayed. The radicle elongation of cucumber was decreased in a dose-dependent manner up to a percentage of 21.44% at the highest dose (
