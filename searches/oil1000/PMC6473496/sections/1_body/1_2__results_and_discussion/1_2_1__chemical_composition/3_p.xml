<p class="p">The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons α-zingiberene (24.9 ± 0.8%), β-sesquiphelladrene (11.9 ± 0.3%), ar-curcumene (10.7 ± 0.2%) and β-bisabolene (10.5 ± 0.3%), detected in lower percentages in turmeric essential oil (2.6 ± 0.1, 2.2 ± 0.0, 1.4 ± 0.1, and 0.6 ± 0.0%, respectively), were the main compounds in ginger essential oil. The results obtained were similar to those of recent research [
