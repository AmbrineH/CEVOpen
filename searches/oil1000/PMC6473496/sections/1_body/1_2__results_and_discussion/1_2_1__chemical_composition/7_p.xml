<p class="p">On the other hand, ar-turmerone (38.7 ± 0.8%), β-turmerone (18.6 ± 0.6%), and α-turmerone (14.20 ± 0.86%), which were not found in ginger oil, were the leading components of turmeric essential oil. The rest of the sesquiterpenes did not reach 1% in either essential oil analyzed (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00059-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These results coincide with those of previous studies in which ar-turmerone, α-turmerone, and β-turmerone were also found to be the leading compounds in turmeric essential oil [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. However, similarly to ginger essential oil, other studies have reported changes in the chemical composition of turmeric essential oil depending on the biological raw material (fresh or dried) employed, with ar-turmerone (24.4%), α-turmerone (20.5%) and β-turmerone (11.1%), or ar-turmerone (49.1 ± 3.5%) and β-turmerone (16.8 ± 0.4%) [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] in fresh 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> rhizome and ar-turmerone (21.4%) and the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons α-santalene (7.2%) and ar-curcumene (6.6%) in turmeric essential oil obtained from dry rhizome [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Higher percentages of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons ar-curcumene (7.8%), zingiberene (4.2%), and β-sesquiphelladrene (22.8%) were found in turmeric essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation from 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], confirming the GC–MS analysis [
