<p class="p">These studies corroborated the insecticidal and antifungal properties of ginger and turmeric essential oils and their beneficial effects on food crops. However, weeds are also responsible for lost production of food crops. Regarding this, weed management in ginger as well as the herbicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> of both hexane and aqueous extracts from ginger has been studied [

 <xref rid="B28-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The phytotoxic effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma</italic> spp., like 
 <italic class="italic">C. zedoaria</italic> essential oil with 1,8-cineole (15.8%) and 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-curzerenone (18.2%) as the main compounds, has also been demonstrated against both lettuce and tomato [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]; 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> extracts with curcuminoids are able to inhibit the germination and growth of

Therefore, the aims of this study were as follows: firstly, to determine through Gas Chromatographyâ€“Mass Spectrometry analysis the chemical composition of commercial ginger and turmeric essential oils in order to know their main constituents; secondly, to observe their 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> herbicidal effects against the seed germination and seedling growth of common ragweed (
 <italic class="italic">Portulaca oleracea</italic> L.), Italian ryegrass (
 <italic class="italic">Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam.), barnyardgrass (
 <italic class="italic">Echinochloa crus-galli</italic> (L.) Beauv.), pampas grass (
 <italic class="italic">Cortaderia selloana</italic> (Schult. &amp; Schult. f.) Asch. &amp; Graebn.), and tree tobacco (
 <italic class="italic">Nicotiana glauca</italic> Graham); and finally, to determine whether these essential oils have phytotoxic effects on food crops like tomato (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.), cucumber (
 <italic class="italic">Cucumis sativus</italic> L.), and rice (
 <italic class="italic">Oryza sativa</italic> L.).
