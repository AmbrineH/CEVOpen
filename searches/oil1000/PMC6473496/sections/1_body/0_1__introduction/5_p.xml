<p class="p">Beneficial health effects of turmeric and especially of curcumin—an orange-yellow-colored, lipophilic polyphenol substance—have been reported [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Curcumin is able to effectively modulate molecular targets that have a role in many phases of cancer development [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. It also has a beneficial effect on inflammation, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In relation to this, it has been observed that curcumin alleviates airway inflammation and ameliorates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the phosphorilation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 together with the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway) [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-08-00059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]; curcumin, being an amyloid-binding probe, reduces chronic inflammation, facilitates resolution of inflammation, and reduces lipid peroxidation that is correlated with synapse loss, causing it to have beneficial effects in Alzheimer’s disease [
