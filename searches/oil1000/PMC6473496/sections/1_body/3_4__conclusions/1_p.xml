<p class="p">Essential oils from ginger and turmeric, two health-promoting spices, could be used in weed control. Ginger essential oil with high contents of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons α-zingiberene (24.9 ± 0.8%), β-sesquiphelladrene (11.9 ± 0.3%), ar-curcumene (10.7 ± 0.2%), and β-bisabolene (10.5 ± 0.3%) may be used as a pre-emergent bioherbicide in the control of 
 <italic class="italic">P. oleracea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. multiflorum</italic> in tomato, cucumber, and rice crops, whereas turmeric essential oil with the oxygenated sesquiterpenes ar-turmerone (38.7 ± 0.8%), β-turmerone (18.6 ± 0.6%), and α-turmerone (14.2 ± 0.9%) can be applied as a post-emergent substance against the weeds tested since no significant phytotoxic effects in tomato, cucumber, or rice were observed. Turmeric essential oil could be a promising alternative in the management of the invasive species 
 <italic class="italic">C. selloana</italic>. More weeds and higher doses of turmeric essential oil must be tested in order to determine any selective herbicide effect.
