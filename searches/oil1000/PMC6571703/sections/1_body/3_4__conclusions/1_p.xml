<p class="p">The effect of selenium on the stability and composition of chickpea oil was assessed using different sodium selenite levels (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/100 g seeds) during germination. When oil from native seeds was compared to 4-day germinated counterparts, the oil content increased from 5.5% to 6.9%, whereas the OSI diminished from 31.8 to 11.4 h. This as a result of dry matter losses during sprouting whereas the observed OSI reduction was associated with enzymatic activity due to the catabolic process of germination. The most abundant fatty acid in all samples was linoleic (57.2 to 59.0%) followed by oleic. The use of selenium improved OSI values up to 46% when the oil extracted from sprouts germinated with 1.0 mg Se/100 g seeds was compared with the counterpart obtained from the germinated control. Lipase activity increased three times after the first day of germination (250 to 1750 UAE/g) for all samples independently of the application of selenium and the highest lipase activity (2000 UAE/g) was observed in sprouts treated with 2 mg of selenite/100 g seeds after the third and fourth germination day. LOX activity, on the other hand, was highest at the end of the programmed germination for non-selenized sprouts. Even though the lipase activity was not affected by selenization, LOX appeared to be associated with the protective effect of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), whose activity is enhanced by selenization. GPX restricts in the first place the amount of hydroperoxides, which in turn reduces LOX activity, increasing the OSI as found in this work. In summary, because LOX activity was lower in selenized treatments and the OSI was higher, the selenium protective effect should be associated with deprivation of hydroperoxides in sprouts. The CAA, on the other hand, increased from around 43% in seeds to 66% for sprouts with and without selenium. The significant difference is attributed mainly to the higher phenolic concentration produced during germination. Selenium exerted a protective effect on the stability of carotenoids. These results suggest that Se-enriched chickpea sprouts could represent an excellent source of oils containing high levels of linoleic acid that possess a high OSI and CAA.</p>
