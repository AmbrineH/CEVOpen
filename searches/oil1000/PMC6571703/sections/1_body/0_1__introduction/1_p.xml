<p class="p">Selenium (Se) is an essential mineral for humans and its intake is limited by the amounts that crops absorb from the soil. Cereals and legumes grown in Se-poor soils are the most common cause of its deficiency in some parts of the world [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SeO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) added during chickpea seed germination (up to 2 mg/100 g seeds) increases isoflavonoids and antioxidant activity in the sprouts and enhances glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activities [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. GPx exerts chemopreventive effects because it reduces lipid hydroperoxide concentration and restricts lipid oxidation in cells as an energy-depriving mechanism [
