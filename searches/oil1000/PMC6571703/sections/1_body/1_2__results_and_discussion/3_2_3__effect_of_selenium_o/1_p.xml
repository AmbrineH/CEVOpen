<p class="p">Lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of ester bonds in water insoluble lipid substrates. These enzymes are one of the first synthesized upon germination. The highest lipase activity was observed on the first day of germination in all treatments (

 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] for sesame seeds, where the highest lipolytic activity was reached at the fourth day of sprouting. The fact that lipase activity has a biphasic behavior (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00113-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A), has been also reported for coffee sprouts and it is associated with the activity of different iso enzymes (lipases I and II). The first being responsible for lipid metabolism in root and shoot growth and the second is active during germination, so the first activity is driven by enzymes already present in the seed and the second phase by the ex novo synthesized lipases. It has been demonstrated that lipase activity can increase in response to elicitors during seed germination. For instance, lanthanide ion (La
 <sup class="sup">+3</sup>) supplemented during soaking of rice seeds and subsequently placed on germination, resulted in significantly higher lipase activity [
