<p class="p">LOX is an enzyme involved in plant physiology, including growth and development, pest resistance, mobilization of storage lipids, and response to wounding and catalyzes deoxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids producing conjugated mono hydroperoxides [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. LOX activity for selenized treatments behaved different when compared to germinated samples, because selenization increased the enzymatic activity by the second day of germination to almost 12,000 UAE/g when the control sample reached only slightly above 6000 UAE/g. During the third day of germination, the selenized treatments reduced the activity, with 2.0 mg/100 g seeds having the highest compared with 0 and 1 mg /100 g seed treatments. After four days germination, the LOX activity decreased by 67% and 55% in sprouts treated with 1 and 2 mg Na
