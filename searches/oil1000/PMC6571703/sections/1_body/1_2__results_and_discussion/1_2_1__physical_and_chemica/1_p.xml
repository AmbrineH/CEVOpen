<p class="p">The effect of selenium in the physical and chemical properties of oil after four days of germination is shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00113-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Oil content in chickpeas is one of the highest among pulses. For instance, the average oil content of chickpeas (6.0%) is significantly higher when compared to common beans (
 <italic class="italic">Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L.) and pigeon peas (
 <italic class="italic">Cajanus cajan</italic> L.) which contain 0.2 and 1.6% oil, respectively. In [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], the oil content in different chickpea cultivars was found to be in a range from 2.70 to 6.48%. Data depicted in 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00113-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the crude fat content was 5.5% for the regular chickpea (without germination, nor selenization), which is within the range reported by [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The oil content increased significantly from 5.5 to 6.9% after four days of germination (

 <xref rid="B13-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], germinated chickpeas started with 3.85% crude fat and finished after three days germination with 4.46%. In [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], an increase of crude fat after four days germination (5.0 to 7.7%) was also observed. The significant change could be associated with the common dry matter losses incurred during germination, especially from the cotyledons rich in protein and starch [
