 <xref rid="B16-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. RI is the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to its velocity in a specified medium, in this case, oil. In oils, the RI can be used for evaluation of rancidity, and according to [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], values increase when the number of conjugated fatty acids also increases. Furthermore, RI is related to molecular weight and type of fatty acid, chain length and degree of unsaturation. As described in 
 <xref rid="plants-08-00113-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, there was an increasing trend in the RI for non-selenized sprouts. It has been reported that the RI of chickpea oil can vary between 1.48 and 1.49 [
