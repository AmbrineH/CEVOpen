<p class="p">As expected, the oxidative stability index (OSI) values of oils extracted from germinated chickpeas decreased due to the progressive catabolic process, but in the oil extracted from sprouts germinated with selenium (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00113-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), a protective effect was observed. The OSI in oil from chickpea seeds was 31.8 h, more than twice that of the germinated sample (11.4 h). Among sprouted chickpeas, the 1.0 mg Na

An interesting research showed that selenized brown rice sprouts, stored for nine months at different temperatures, maintained high quality and oxidative stability compared to their regular counterparts. The significant difference was attributed to the antioxidant activity of selenium and its inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation [

Another study investigated the influence of selenium over olive oil, and the authors found that foliar application of this trace mineral exerted a positive effect on oil OSI and the effect was more intense when the olive trees were also subjected to drought stress [

It is known that selenium is involved in stress tolerance through ROS detoxification, and helps to maintain the membrane integrity of the oil bodies and the stability of proteins and enzymes. In the case of mineral stress, as reported by [

 <xref rid="plants-08-00113-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, germination decreased OSI as expected, because of the hydrolytic activity of lipases synthesized to yield energy for seedling development. The OSI of oils extracted from selenized sprouts compared with non-selenized counterparts had an increasing trend, implying a protective effect of selenium over the oil fraction. The observed effect is mainly attributed to the activity against lipid hydroperoxide production via GPx, decreasing the total lipid oxidation [
