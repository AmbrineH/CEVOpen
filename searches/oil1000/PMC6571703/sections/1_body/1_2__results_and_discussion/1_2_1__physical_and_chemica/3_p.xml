<p class="p">The acid value (AV) in oil increases significantly during germination. The index is related to free fatty acid content and is an important indicator of vegetable oil quality. An increment in AV in oil indicates hydrolysis of triglycerides, a reaction that occurs during germination due to the augmentation in lipase A1 and A2 activities, enzymes synthesized to provide energy for seedling development [

 <xref rid="plants-08-00113-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> it can be observed that the AV of the original chickpea seed was 5.0%, whereas in the sprouts without selenium, it was 12.4%. The highest level of AV of 15.6% was observed in the oil extracted from sprouts with 0.5 mg selenium.
