<p class="p">The CAA of oil from chickpea sprouts with and without selenium increased from 43% to 66% in comparison to seeds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00113-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A). No significant differences were found in the CAA of oils extracted from chickpea sprouts treated with and without selenium. In vegetable oils, the CAA is closely associated with antioxidant compounds such as carotenoids and phenolics [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] and the results in this case indicate that the content of phenolic compounds was related to the CAA (r = 0.492) with a

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00113-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). Compared to chickpea seed oil, the largest increments of phenolics were 36% and 34% in treatments without selenium and with 0.5 mg Na
