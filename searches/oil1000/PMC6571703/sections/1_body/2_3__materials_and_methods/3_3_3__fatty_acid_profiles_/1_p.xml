 <xref rid="B38-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The equipment used was: GC- FID (6890N, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a SP2380 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.20 µm film thickness). Helium was used as carrier gas (1 mL/min). The temperature program was: 50 °C (2 min), ramp to 250 °C, 4 °C/min and 1 min maintenance. Injector and detector temperatures were 260 and 280 °C, respectively.
