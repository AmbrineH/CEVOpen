<p class="p">Oil in water emulsions of chickpea sprouts were prepared using 1% oil in 98% water and 1% Tween 20, homogenized with a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA, USA) at a pressure of 8000 bar. The operation was repeated four times. The CAA of oil chickpea emulsions was evaluated using the protocol described by [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-08-00113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] with slight modifications as follows: CaCo-2 cells were seeded in a 96-well microplate (1 × 104 − 1 × 105 cells/well) and used when reaching their exponential growth phase. After incubation for 24 h, the cell culture medium was discarded and the cells gently washed with 100 μL of PBS (37 °C). Oil emulsions were evaluated at 1:1000 dilutions in cell culture medium with 60 μM dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C and 5% of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, the medium was removed and the cells washed again with 150 μL of warm PBS. Then, 100 μL of PBS with 94.5 μg/mL of 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was added to detect fluorescence (485/538 nm) during 2 h. CAA units were calculated with the following formula: CAA units = 100 − (∫ SA/∫ CA) × 100, where ∫ SA (sample area) is the integrated area under the curve for the sample fluorescence versus time and ∫ CA (control area) is the integrated area from the control curve.
