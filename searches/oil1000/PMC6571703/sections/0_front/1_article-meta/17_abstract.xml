 <p class="p">Selenium is an essential mineral in human nutrition. In order to assess its effect on the stability of chickpea oil, seeds were germinated and tested with different amounts of sodium selenite (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/100g seeds) for four days. Oil was extracted from sprouted chickpea and its physical properties, fatty acid profile (FAME), oxidative stability index (OSI), lipase and lipoxygenase (LOX) activities, cellular antioxidant activity (CAA), and phenolics and carotenoids were assessed and compared to chickpea seed oil. The amount of chickpea oil and its acid value (AV) increased during germination. The OSI increased by 28%, 46% and 14% for 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/100g compared with non-selenium treated sprouts. Phenolics increased up to 36% and carotenoids reduced by half in germinated sprouts with and without selenium compared to seeds. Carotenoids increased by 16% in sprouts treated with 1.0 mg/100 g selenium compared to their counterparts without selenium. FAME was not affected by treatments but samples with the highest selenium concentration increased lipase activity by 19% and decreased lipoxygenase activity by 55% compared with untreated sprouts. The CAA of oils increased by 43% to 66% in all germinated treatments compared with seeds. Results suggest that Se-enriched chickpea sprouts could represent an excellent source of oil with a high OSI and CAA, associated with a reduction in LOX activity and an increase in phenolics, respectively.</p>
