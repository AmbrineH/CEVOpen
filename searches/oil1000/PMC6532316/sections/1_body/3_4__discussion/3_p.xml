<p class="p">In a previous study performed by Polydorou [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], cylindrical specimens (4.5 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness) created with CX and XTE were light-cured under mylar and, subsequently, stored for 24 h, 7 d, and 28 d in different storage media, including ethanol. They found TEGDMA, DUDMA, and Bis-GMA in XTE eluates, but no elution of monomers for the CX group. The authors attributed such an outcome to the different chemical composition of the two composite materials. Indeed, Ceram X (CX) is a nanohybrid Ormocer-based material, which seems to achieve a great degree of conversion during polymerization reaction, so that low monomer release and high biocompatibility is accomplished [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The results of our current study are in disagreement with those latter ones, as we observed that the polymerization of CX was dependent on the type of light-curing strategy employed; both tested resin composites released a micromolar amount of methacrylates.
