<p class="p">The hardness of resin composites can be affected by several elements, such as organic and inorganic composition, filler load, and degree of polymerization [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Our results showed that the two resin composites (XTE and CX) used in this study had no significant difference in terms of microhardness when light-cured in the presence of glycerin, argon gas, or air (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Nevertheless, CX polymerized using the mylar matrix reached significantly lower microhardness (VHN) than those achieved by CX polymerized in any other condition. The highest VHN was achieved when CX was polymerized in the presence of argon. Likewise, XTE reached the maximum VHN values when cured in argon atmosphere. Accordingly, the first hypothesis of this study must be in part accepted, although hardness and monomers elution seem to be also correlated with the chemical composition of the resin composite selected for clinical restorations.
