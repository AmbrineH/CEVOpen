<p class="p">The HPLC results obtained in this study showed that CX specimens released a significant lower amount of TEGDMA when light-cured using the mylar matrix compared to all the other tested groups. Conversely, the amount of monomers released from XTE was not influenced by the type of light-curing protocol employed to polymerize the specimens, with or without oxygen barriers.</p>
