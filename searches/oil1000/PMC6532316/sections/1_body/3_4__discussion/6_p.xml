<p class="p">Composite discoloration may be influenced by many factors, such as degree of conversion during light-curing procedures sorption and solubility and organic and inorganic chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. This current study showed that the ΔE values of CX were often lower than those obtained with XTE; again, this may be correlated with the fact that CX is a nanohybrid composite, while XTE is a nanofilled composite. A study of Ergücü [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] compared the color stabilities of five different composites and observed that when these were exposed to coffee for one week, CX and XTE light-cured using a mylar matrix showed a significant increase in discoloration compared to the other tested composite materials. Moreover, Celik [
