<p class="p">The microhardness results are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. It was observed that CX light-cured using the Mylar matrix (Group A) had significantly lower hardness values (570 MPa) (p&lt;0.01 vs Group B, p&lt;0.0001 vs Group C, p&lt;0.0001 vs Group D) compared to all the specimens light-cured in different polymerization conditions. Regarding XTE, the best performance was achieved in argon-rich atmosphere (812 MPa) (Group C) compared to mylar (Group A) (p&lt;0.001) and air (Group D) (p&lt;0.01). Significant differences were found between CX and XTE light-cured under mylar matrix (Groups A) (p&lt;0.001).
