<p class="p">Red wine and coffee induced a significant increase in discoloration of the XTE specimens compared to CX specimens (p&lt;0.0001), except for the specimens polymerized in the presence of oxygen (group D) and evaluated in WB (p=ns). In 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, it is possible to note how the storage in water induced only a minor discoloration effect on both composites when compared to the results attained in the specimens stored in the two staining solutions (red wine and coffee) (ΔE) (p&lt;0.0001). However, after water storage, the specimens in Group D showed a significant increase in ΔE variation compared to Groups A, B, and C (p &lt;0.001). The discoloration results showed that the specimens polymerized in air (group D) were almost always more susceptible to the chromatic changes induced by wine and coffee compared to the other groups.
