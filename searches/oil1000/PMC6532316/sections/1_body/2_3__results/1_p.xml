<p class="p">The HPLC results showed that the amount of monomers released from the composite specimens was very low in all polymerization conditions (Figures

Overall, the presence of DUDMA and bis-GMA was mainly detected for the XTE specimens, while TEGDMA was found principally in the eluate of the CX specimens. In detail, the CX specimens light-cured with the use of the mylar matrix (Group A) showed the lowest amount of TEGDMA (p&lt;0.01) compared to all the tested groups (
