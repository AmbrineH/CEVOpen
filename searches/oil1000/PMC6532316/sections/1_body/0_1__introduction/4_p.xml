<p class="p">A suitable method to evaluate the effect of oxygen on the polymerization of resin composites is through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is widely used to determine the amount of monomers eluted from the resin matrix during water storage [

Moreover, color stability of resin composites is essential to achieve and maintain acceptable aesthetic goals in direct restorative dentistry. Indeed, by using a spectrophotometer, it may be possible to “translate” the color in coordinates and calculate the staining effects induced by different staining solutions, (e.g., coffee, red wine, tea) [
