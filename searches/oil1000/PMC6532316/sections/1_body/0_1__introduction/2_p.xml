<p class="p">Nevertheless, their polymerization reaction can be inhibited during light-curing procedures due to the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere. This latter acts as scavenger, which tends to convert highly reactive radicals into relatively stable hydroperoxides. The presence of these latter components can alter the quality of the polymerization of the outer layer of resin composites [
