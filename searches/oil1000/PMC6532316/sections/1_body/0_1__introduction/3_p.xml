<p class="p">Due to the importance of the polymerization reaction for the hardness and monomer elution, as well as for aesthetic discoloration of composite resins, it is mandatory, especially in clinical practice, to optimize the polymerization reaction conditions [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Transparent polyester strip (mylar strip) as well as the use of a layer of glycerin accomplishes such a purpose. Indeed, Mylar strip and glycerin can act as physical barriers once placed on the surface of the resin before the light-curing procedures. Conversely, in the presence of an argon-rich atmosphere, the formation of free radicals is drastically reduced during the polymerization reaction. This happens because argon atoms bind and inhibit such radicals and the degree of conversion of monomers to polymers is enhanced [
