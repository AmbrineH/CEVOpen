<p class="p">Three specimens for each group (twelve for each material) were analyzed to evaluate the Vickers microhardness (Microhardness Tester MHT4, Zeiss, Jana, Germany), with 100â€‰g load (0.981 N) and 10 s duel-time (slope: 10 gf/s). Three indentations were recorded for each specimen at different areas of the outer surface. The mean value was then calculated and converted into a Vickers hardness number (VHN) as described in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. VHN values were expressed as N/mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (MPa).
