<p class="p">Three specimens for each group (twelve for each material) were used to evaluate the elution of monomers after different light-curing procedures. The HPLC was employed to determine the amount of monomers leached out from the specimens after storage, immersion in ethanol (2.8 mL), and incubation for 24 h at 37°C [
