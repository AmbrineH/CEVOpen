<p class="p">Sixty specimens for each material (total number: 120) were prepared using a stainless-steel mold to obtain disc-shape specimens (diameter: 6.5 mm; thickness 2 mm). A nanofilled (Filtek Supreme XTE, 3 M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) (XTE) and a nanohybrid composite (CeramX Universal, Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) (CX) (
