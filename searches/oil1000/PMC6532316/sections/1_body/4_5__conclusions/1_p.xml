<p class="p">Color stability and discoloration of resin composites may be influenced by material type and light-curing strategy. The most appropriate composite should be selected not only for its handling or for its mechanical properties, but also for its color stability, especially if this will be used in esthetic areas. Furthermore, when a clinician is not able for some reasons to properly finish and polish composite restorations, the application of a light-curing protocol performed in the absence of oxygen may improve the chemicophysical properties, as well as the polishability of resin composites. The use of glycerin or argon gas may be suitable for light-curing procedures of occlusal surface in posterior teeth, as well as in all those zones of the composite restoration that cannot be covered by a mylar matrix. However, the advantages of performing light-curing procedures in argon atmosphere should be further investigated.</p>
