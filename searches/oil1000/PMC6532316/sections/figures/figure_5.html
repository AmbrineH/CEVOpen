 <p> Bis-GMA micromoles released after 24 h ethanol incubation from XTE disks. Three specimens for each group (twelve for each material) were used to evaluate the elution of monomers after different light-curing procedures. The concentration of Bis-GMA released into the ethanol was quantified before and after each analysis and compared to the values of a calibration line. The error bars represent the standard deviation of measurements for 3 specimens in 3 separate sample runs (n = 3). Data are expressed as mean ± SD. </p>
