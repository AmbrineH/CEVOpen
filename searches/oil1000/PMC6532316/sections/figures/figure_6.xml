  <p class="p">Microhardness of the specimens under different polymerization conditions. Three specimens for each group (n=3; twelve for each material) were analyzed to evaluate surface using a Vickers hardness tester. Three indentations were recorded for each specimen. The mean value was then calculated and converted into a Vickers hardness number (VHN). VHN values were expressed as N/mm2 (MPa). The error bars represent the standard deviation of measurements for 3 specimens in 3 separate determinations (n = 3). Data are expressed as mean ± SD.
