 <p class="p">The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of light-curing protocols on two modern resin composites using different air-inhibition coating strategies. This was accomplished by assessing the amount of monomer elution, surface microhardness, and composite discoloration in different storage conditions. A total of 120 specimens were prepared using Filtek Supreme XTE (3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) and CeramX Universal (Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany). Specimens were light-cured in air as per manufacturer's instructions or in the absence of oxygen. This latter condition was achieved using three different approaches: (i) transparent polyester strip; (ii) glycerin; (iii) argon gas. Specimens were assessed for release of monomers, Vickers hardness, and discoloration after storage in different solutions. The results were analyzed with ANOVA one-way test followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test. Moreover, multiple comparisons of means were performed using the Student t-test (p&lt;0.05). The amount of monomers released from the tested specimens was very low in all conditions. The presence of oxygen induced some decrease in microhardness. The highest discoloration values, for both materials, were obtained after ageing in red wine. In case finish and polish procedures are awkward to achieve in posteriors composite restoration, light-curing in the absence of oxygen should be considered, especially when performing composite restoration in esthetic areas.</p>
