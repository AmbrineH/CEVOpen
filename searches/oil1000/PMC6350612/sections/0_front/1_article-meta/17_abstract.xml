 <p class="p">The resistance mechanisms of bacteria and protozoans have evidenced the need of discover new compounds with potential pharmaceutical activity against pathogenic microorganisms. Medicinal plants have been for centuries a promising alternative as sources of new drugs. The objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition, antimicrobial and antileishmanial activities of
  <italic class="italic"> Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare</italic>, and
  <italic class="italic"> Curcuma longa</italic> essential oils. Chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial activity was performed by disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. Antileishmanial activity was performed against antipromastigote and intracellular amastigote of
  <italic class="italic"> Leishmania amazonensis</italic>. Cytotoxic and nitrite production were realized in BALB/c peritoneal macrophages. The major compounds of the essential oils were cinnamic aldehyde (46.30%) in
  <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic>, cis-p-menth-2-en-1-ol (33.88%) and linalyl acetate (13.90%) in
  <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic>, and turmerone (55.43%) in
  <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic>. The MIC showed significant antimicrobial activity of
  <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil against
  <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> (83.3 ± 14.43 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL). Antipromastigote activity showed IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values &gt;500 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL to
  <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic>, 308.4 ± 1.402 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL to
  <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic>, and 405.5 ± 1.119 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL to
  <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil. Activity against intracellular amastigote of
  <italic class="italic"> L. amazonensis </italic>showed IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 63.3 ± 1.369 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL and cytotoxic was not observed, resulting in selectivity index higher than 15.79 to parasite.
  <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil decreased nitrite production in peritoneal macrophages, but not in
  <italic class="italic"> Leishmania-</italic>infected cells. The chemical composition of the three essential oils is directly associated to its potential biological action, as the antimicrobial activity.
  <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> presented a potent antileishmanial activity against promastigote and intracellular amastigote of
  <italic class="italic"> L. amazonensis</italic>, although this activity is not linked to nitric oxide, since
  <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil inhibits its production.
