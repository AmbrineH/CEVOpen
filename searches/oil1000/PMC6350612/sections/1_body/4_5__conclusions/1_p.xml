<p class="p">The major compounds in the essential oils were cinnamic aldehyde (
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic>), turmerone (
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>), and cis-p-Menth-2-en-1-ol (
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic>). All three essential oils exhibited antimicrobial action, highlighting
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>. Antileishmanial activity against promastigote forms of
 <italic class="italic"> L. amazonensis</italic> was observed to
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil, but not to
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic> essential oil.
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil activity against intracellular amastigote is the first description of activity against the parasite form found in mammal host, ensuring their potential antileishmanial activity.
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil did not induce NO production in BALB/c peritoneal macrophages, suggesting that intracellular amastigote activity may be related to other mechanisms.
