<p class="p">The essential oil yield of
 <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> was 0.73%, 0.9%, and 3.4%, respectively. GC-MS was used to identify, quantify, and evaluate the chemical compounds present in leaves
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic>, in the aerial parts of
 <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic>, and in the rhizome of
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic>, as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Compounds present in essential oils were enumerated according to elution order and retention time. Fifteen compounds were identified in
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic>, with peaks 6, 8, and 9 being identified as cinnamic aldehyde (46.30%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-copaene (16.35%), and trans-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Caryophyllene (8.26%), respectively, representing its main constituents.
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil showed 17 compounds with turmerone (55.43%), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-turmerone (12.02%), and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-curcumene (6.96) as major compounds.
 <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic> essential oil presented 20 compounds, with cis-p-Menth-2-en-1-ol (33.88%) and linalyl acetate (13.90%) identified as the main constituents.
