<p class="p">Data of the antileishmanial activity, cytotoxicity, and SI are described in

 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> presented the better antipromastigote activity between the three essential oils, while
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> showed the worst activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). As the
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> showed the most potent antipromastigote activity between the three essential oils (p&lt;0.0001), the intracellular amastigote activity was performed only with their essential oil, which showed a 4.87-fold decrease in the intracellular amastigote IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value when compared to the promastigote IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>. The analysis of infection parameters showed that at 125 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL there was a statistically significant reduction of all parameters of infection, with decrease of amastigote number in 200 cells and percentage of infected cells of 80.73% and 40.75%, respectively, and mean of amastigotes per cell reduction from 9.74 to 2.74. The decrease in infection parameters was even further reduced at 250 and 500 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The decrease in intracellular amastigote number, percentage of infected cells, and mean of amastigotes per infected cell induced by
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil treatment are observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. None of the three essential oils presented cytotoxicity at the analyzed concentrations. The SI showed that
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil has activity 15.79-fold more selective to intracellular amastigote of
 <italic class="italic"> L. amazonensis</italic> than to BALB/c peritoneal macrophage. The reference drug amphotericin B showed antileishmanial activity and cytotoxicity as expected.
