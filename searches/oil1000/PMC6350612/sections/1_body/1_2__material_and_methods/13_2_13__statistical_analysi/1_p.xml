<p class="p">The numerical results were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation and were organized into tables or plotted in graphs. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> were obtained from a nonlinear regression curve of concentration log versus normalized response. Comparison between IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values was performed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Analyses were performed with the software GraphPad Prism 7.00 and differences were considered significant when p&lt;0.05.
