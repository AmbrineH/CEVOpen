<p class="p">The essential oils under study were dissolved in ethyl acetate 1 mg/mL and analyzed on Shimadzu QP 5000 gas chromatograph with ZB-5 ms capillary column (5% phenyl arylene 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) coupled at 70 eV (40-500 Da) HP 5MS mass selective detector of electronic impact with a transference temperature of 280°C. Chromatographic conditions were volume injection of 0.3
