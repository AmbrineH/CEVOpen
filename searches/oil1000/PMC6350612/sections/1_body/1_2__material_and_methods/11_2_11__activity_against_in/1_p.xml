<p class="p">Peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c were cultured in 24-well plates (5x10

 <italic class="italic"> L. amazonensis</italic> promastigote forms, 10:1 parasite/cell, for 6 h and afterwords washed to remove noninternalized parasites. The infected cells were treated with different essential oil concentrations (62.5–500 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h. The coverslips with the infected and treated cells were fixed with Bouin, stained with Giemsa, and examined by light microscopy. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was calculated from the total of intracellular amastigote from 200 cells. The percentage of infected cells was obtained from the number of infected cells divided by two. The mean number of amastigotes per cell was obtained from the number of intracellular amastigotes in 200 cells divided by the number of infected cells [
