<p class="p">Peritoneal macrophages were cultured in 96-well plates (5×10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/mL) with different concentrations of essential oils (7.8–1000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) or amphotericin B (0.07–10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) up to a final volume of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L per well, at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Wells without cells were used as blanks and wells with cells and DMSO 1% only were used as controls. After 24 h, the cells were analyzed by MTT colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Briefly, 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and after two hours then the medium was discarded, and 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorbance values were normalized, with absorbance value of control used as 100%, and the results were used to calculate the 50% cell cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>).
