<p class="p">Disk diffusion tests were performed with filter paper impregnated with 75

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth dilution methodology and performed in triplicate with the same bacterium used in disk diffusion test. An aliquot of the essential oil prepared in DMSO was transferred to a test tube containing BHI broth. Serial dilutions of essential oils were then performed resulting in concentrations of 5–2000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. Amoxicillin, gentamycin, and polymyxin B (0.015 a 128 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) were used as reference. Microbial suspensions containing 1.5x10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL of the bacteria were added at each concentration of essential oil or antibiotic drug and incubated at 35°C for 24 h. Tubes without bacteria were used as control of broth sterility and bacterial growth. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration which visibly inhibited bacterial growth observed by the absence of visible turbidity. BHI broth was subjected to the inoculum microbial seeding test on the surface of plate-count agar to confirm growth inhibition [
