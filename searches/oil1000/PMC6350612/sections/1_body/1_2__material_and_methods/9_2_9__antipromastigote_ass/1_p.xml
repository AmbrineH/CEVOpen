 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigote forms from a 2-4-day-old culture were placed in 96-well plates with different concentrations of essential oils (3.9–500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) or amphotericin B (0.01–2.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL), at a final volume of 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L per well for 72 h. Wells without parasites were used as blanks and wells with parasites and DMSO 1% were used as controls. Parasite viability was evaluated by the modified colorimetric method with tetrazolium-dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and after five hours 150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorbance was read on a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 570 nm. The data was normalized, with absorbance value of control used as 100%, and the results were used to calculate the 50% inhibition of parasite growth (IC
