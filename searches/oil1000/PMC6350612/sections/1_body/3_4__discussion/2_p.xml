<p class="p">Different investigations have identified and quantified several chemical compounds of the essential oils of
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic>. The essential oils yield obtained in our extraction was similar to that described in literature [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], as well as chemical composition, where cinnamaldehyde is generally the main component of
 <italic class="italic"> C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and turmerone the major compound of
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. On the other hand, there are different chemotypes described to
 <italic class="italic"> O. vulgare</italic> revealing different chemical profile, as the chemotype rich in linalool/linalyl acetate with predominant presence of linalyl acetate, the chemotype rich in carvacrol and c-terpinene, and chemotype rich in thymol [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>].
