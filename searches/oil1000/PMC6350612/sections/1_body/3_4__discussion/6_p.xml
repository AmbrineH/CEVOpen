 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> essential oil presented the better activity among the three oils, and in literature there are several constituents isolated and related to its antileishmanial activity, with curcumin being the most described. Curcumin has shown an average IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 5.3 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>M against promastigotes of various leishmanial strains [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Curcumin 1, demethoxycurcumin 2, and bis-demethoxycurcumin 3, isolated from the rhizomes of
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic>, showed moderate activity against
 <italic class="italic"> L. major</italic> promastigote, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 7.8, 14.1, and 21.5 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Synthetic derivatives of curcumin were ten times more efficient than the original curcumin against
 <italic class="italic"> L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Four curcuminoid analogs showed IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values less than 5 mM to promastigotes of
 <italic class="italic"> L. major</italic> and axenic culture of
 <italic class="italic"> L. mexicana</italic> amastigotes, with the majority presenting values higher to amastigote axenic than promastigote [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>].
