<p class="p">The enhancement of activity observed by
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil against intracellular amastigote suggests that antileishmanial activity may be related to not only direct action against the parasite, but also indirect mechanism. Mechanisms of direct action on
 <italic class="italic"> Leishmania</italic> have already been described for the analog of curcumin trans-dibenzalacetone. It alters the general ultrastructure and the mitochondrial physiology of the parasite and triggers apoptotic cell death in
 <italic class="italic"> L. donovani</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Macrophage activation is one of the more important mechanisms of indirect action, as induction of reactive oxygen species and reactive oxygen nitrogen species. Several plant materials have antileishmanial activity associated with induction of macrophage activation [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], especially inducing nitric oxide (NO) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated the nitrite production, an indirect measurement to quantify NO, in supernatant of BALB/c peritoneal macrophages infected or not with
