<p class="p">Nitrite quantification showed that
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil inhibited NO production in peritoneal macrophages. The anti-inflammatory activity of
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> (turmeric) has been described for a long time [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], and inhibition of NO production has already been described in a macrophage cell RAW 264.7 stimulated by LPS [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Altough we observed an increase of nitrite in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with
 <italic class="italic"> L. amazonensis</italic> and treated with
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil when compared with unstimulated and treated cells, there was no significant enhancement in its NO production due to treatment. Indeed, there is a description of curcumin that overcomes the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on
 <italic class="italic"> L. major</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> L. donovani</italic>. As an antioxidant, curcumin is capable of blocking the action of both NO and NO congeners on the
 <italic class="italic"> Leishmania</italic> parasite by acting on S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) and DETANONOate, which release NO, 3-morpholino-sydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1), which releases NO and superoxide, and peroxynitrite, which is formed from the reaction of NO with superoxide [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The inability of inducing NO production in BALB/c peritoneal macrophages reveals that probably there are other possible mechanisms involved in intracellular amastigote activity of
 <italic class="italic"> C. longa</italic> essential oil which should be elucidated in further studies.
