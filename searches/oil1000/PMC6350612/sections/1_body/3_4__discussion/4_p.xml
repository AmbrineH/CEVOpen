<p class="p">The yield and quality of essential oils vary with genetics, agroclimatic conditions, cultivation techniques, soil conditions, harvest time, etc. Therefore, chemical compositions and major compounds of essential oils vary in different habitats, and their bioactivity is closely associated with changes in their composition. Cinnamic aldehyde, for example, showed MIC ranging from 0.5 to 1000
