<p class="p">SEM was used to reveal morphological changes between the PEO treated and untreated
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> cells as previously described [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Briefly, 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of PEO treated (150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and nontreated
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> NCTC 11168 cells (OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>=0.6) was fixed with an equal quantity of 2.5% (v/w) glutaraldehyde (PBS, pH 7.4). After 2 h incubation at 21°C, cells were centrifuged (12,000 x g, 1 min), gradually dehydrated in ethanol (10 min in 50%, 10 min in 80%, and 10 min in 96%), and dried for 30 min first with 50% and then with 100% hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, Fluka, USA). The resulting
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> cells were coated with a layer of gold using fine coat ion-sputter JFC 1100 (JEOL, UK), after mounting them on aluminium stubs. For visualization, 16 kV and 10,000x magnification was used on a JSM 6300 Scanning Microscope (JEOL, UK). Changes in cell morphology were ranked: 1, typical spiral form; 2, spiral shape not definite; 3, straightened and elongated shape. Based on these criteria affected cells on 5 fields of 10,000x magnification were observed and categorized and their distributions were expressed as a percentage of the nonaffected cells. Treatments for SEM analysis were repeated once.
