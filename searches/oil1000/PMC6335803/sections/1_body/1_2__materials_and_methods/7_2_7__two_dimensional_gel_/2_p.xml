<p class="p">The excised gels were cut into small pieces and digested as previously described [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Bio-Rad) was used to remove coomassie and SDS remnants from the gel slabs. Dehydration in acetonitrile was followed by 10 mM DTT (Bio-Rad) treatment in order to reduce disulfide bridges. Free-SH groups were alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (Bio-Rad) solutions and these modified proteins were in-gel digested with side-chain protected trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted from the gel, dried, and redissolved before mass spectrometry analysis. The 2D SDS-PAGE experiments were repeated twice from two different treatments (a total of 4 runs). The only spots analyzed were those that were unambiguously detected with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Changes in expressions of the identified proteins were confirmed by RT-PCR.
