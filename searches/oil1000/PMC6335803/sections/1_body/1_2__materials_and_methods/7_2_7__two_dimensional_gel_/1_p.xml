 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> PEO. Briefly, after sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4, the protein concentrations were determined with DC™ Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g) were dissolved in the 2D sample buffer (8M urea, 2% CHAPS, 50mM DTT, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes, trace bromophenol blue, all from Bio-Rad) and loaded on IPG strips (7 cm, pH 3-10, Bio-Rad) for isoelectric focusing (IEF) (1., 250V, 2 h, linear, 2., 500V, 2 h, linear, 3., 4000 V, 10000 Vh). IEF strips were equilibrated for 10 min in 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, trace bromophenol blue, and 2% DTT (Bio-Rad) and then for 10 min in the same solution containing 2.5% IAA instead of DTT. Separation of proteins according to molecular mass was performed by 2D SDS-PAGE at 80 V for 20 min and 120 V (20 min), visualized by staining with coomassie R-250, and scanned (Pharos FX, Bio-Rad). For protein identification and mass spectrometric analysis the bands of interest were excised from the gels. SDS-PAGE experiments were carried out twice for both the treated and untreated samples.
