SYBR green master mix (Bio-Rad, USA), the Rotor Gene, RG3000 apparatus (Qiagen, Germany), and the following conditions were used: 15 s at 96°C, 15 s at 50°C, and 25 s at 72°C, with 45 repeats. Melting-curve analyses were performed immediately after each amplification. Samples were normalized to the phosphoglucosamine mutase (
