<p class="p">Compound composition and antibacterially active compounds of PEO were visualized in parallel on two preconditioned (100°C for 30 min) 5 x 10 cm 60 F
 <sub class="sub">254</sub> thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Merck, Germany). Prior to the experiment 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L PEO sample was dissolved in 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L absolute ethanol. From this solution 0.2 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L aliquots were deposited in a horizontal thin line at the bottom of the plates, and ethanol was served as a solvent control. 10 mg/mL menthol, isomenthone, and menthone (Sigma, Hungary) were used as compound controls (1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) with known running features. TLC plates were developed with toluene–ethyl acetate (95:5) in a saturated twin trough chamber (Camag, Switzerland). Separated compounds of PEO were visualized by dipping one TLC plate into the ethanolic vanillin–sulphuric acid reagent and heated for 5 min at 90°C. Separated compounds were identified based on their R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> values, determined by the known standards (menthol, isomenthone, menthone). The other plate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C under microaerobic conditions in 50 mL BHI-
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> suspension (3 x 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cfu mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Then the plates were immersed in an aqueous solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 0.05 g/ 90 mL) for 10 s and incubated for 2 h under microaerobic conditions. Antibacterial activities of the separated compounds were revealed as white spots against the bluish background [
