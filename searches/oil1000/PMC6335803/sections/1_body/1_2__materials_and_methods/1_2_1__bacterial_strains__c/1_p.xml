 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and 4 reference strains (NCTC 11168, RM1221, 81-176, 81116) were screened with the drop plate method (10 mg / drop) in order to confirm the general antibacterial effect of PEO on this species. Diameters of the individual inhibition zones were measured 48 hour after incubation under microaerophilic condition at 37°C. For the detailed analyses, based on phenotypic, genomic, proteomic investigations, the well characterized reference
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni </italic>strain NCTC 11168 was used. Logarithmic (OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>=0.6) cells were prepared as follows: bacteria were grown on CCDA (Charcoal Cefoperazone Deoxycholate Agar) at 37°C under microaerobic conditions (Don Whitley Scientific, United Kingdom) for 24 h. Cells were collected with a loop and suspended in PBS. Bacterial cell counts were standardized in PBS by setting the optical density (OD) to 1.0 (approx. 4x10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> cells) at 600 nm. The suspension was then diluted 50 times in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (starter culture) to the required volume and grown under microaerobic conditions until it reached OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub>=0.6. The resulting logarithmic suspension served as a starting suspension for all experiments. PEO containing pure extract without solvent was purchased from AROMAX Co. (Hungary). The EO quality was consistent with the standards detailed in the European Pharmacopoeia (4th edition).
