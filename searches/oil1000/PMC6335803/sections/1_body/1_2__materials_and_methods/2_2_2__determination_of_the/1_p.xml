 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). No PEO was added to the control wells. Samples were retrieved after 24 h incubation under microaerobic condition at 37°C, and CFUs were determined by making serial dilutions. The number of colonies was counted and recalculated to 1ml volume, and MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of PEO that inhibited visible bacterial growth. MBC was defined as the lowest concentration that killed 99.9% of the initial inoculum. Experiments were performed 3 times on 3 different days.
