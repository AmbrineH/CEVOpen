<p class="p">GC-MS was implemented to identify PEO compounds using the Agilent 6890N/5973N GC-MSD (USA) system with Agilent HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m × 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m). Detailed run conditions are described in detail elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Peaks were identified based on their retention times and standard addition while percentage evaluation was performed by using area normalization. Compound composition of the sample was analyzed twice in two consecutive runs.
