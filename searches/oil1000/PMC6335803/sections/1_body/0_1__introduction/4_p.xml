<p class="p">The main objectives of this study were (i) to confirm the antibacterial effect of PEO on a broad
 <italic class="italic"> Campylobacter jejuni</italic> isolate collection, (ii) to reveal the virulence potential modulating effect of this EO, (iii) to get an insight about the characteristic changes that typify this stress response, and (iv) not least to reveal the type of the stress response with which
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> answers this environmental challenge. For this purpose we applied phenotypic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and electron-microscopic methods.
