<p class="p">Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of juniper preparations to impede adhesion [

 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> to polystyrene surfaces. Thyme and olive extracts may inhibit adhesion not only to artificial surfaces, but also to intestinal epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. These studies illustrate the capacity of extracts to impede survival of
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> on solid surfaces, while others revealed the virulence potential modulating effect of clove EO using transcriptomic and phenotypic methods [
