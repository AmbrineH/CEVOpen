<p class="p">Peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic>) is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for aiding digestion and treating gastrointestinal diseases [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This feature was clinically confirmed, along with its antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Although the inhibition of
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> growth by peppermint oil has been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], no detailed study has been dedicated to the evaluation of its anti-
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> and antivirulent effect. Environmental stresses can determine the potential of a microorganism to evoke a disease as stress responses were revealed to be major factors in virulence gene expression [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. It is generally thought that due to membrane lesions, the EO evokes an oxidative stress response [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However,
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> uniquely lacks the classical oxidative stress response regulatory elements SoxRS and OxyR [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] present in a wide range of bacteria. It only expresses DNA protector protein (Dps), Superoxide dismutase B (SodB), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C (AhpC), and catalase (KatA) to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies have revealed that in
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni,</italic> general and chemical stresses are managed by important molecular chaperones like GroEL [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and DnaK [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The role of GroEL and DnaK was demonstrated under different stress conditions including low osmolarity medium [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], oxidative circumstances [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], low or high temperature [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], and the presence of zinc-oxide [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. These stress situations led to the transformation of
 <italic class="italic"> Campylobacter</italic> into a viable, potentially pathogenic, but not culturable (VBNC), state [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This state is characterized by typical rounded cell morphology.
