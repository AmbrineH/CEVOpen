 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter jejuni</italic> is the most common gastrointestinal bacterial pathogen around the world [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. This microaerophilic bacterium belongs to the intestinal flora of birds [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and therefore human cases are mostly associated with fecal contamination during slaughter and the subsequent consumption of undercooked poultry products [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Details of the pathogenic process are still not entirely clear, but the unambiguous importance of motility by flagella and adhesion mediated by cell surface factors like CadF [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], PEB1 [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and PEB4 [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] is confirmed. Although infections caused by
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> are usually self-limiting and rarely require therapeutic intervention, the emergence of antibiotic resistance among isolates [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], the recent description of a hypervirulent [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and a multidrug resistant clone [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] from animal husbandries raises major epidemiological and healthcare concerns. Therefore new strategies are needed to control this food-borne bacterium. One option for this is the application of essential oils (EOs) with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, offering an alternative opportunity for prevention [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>].
