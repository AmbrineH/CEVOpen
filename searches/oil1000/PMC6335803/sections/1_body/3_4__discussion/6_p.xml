<p class="p">The markedly elevated level of

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) supports the chemical nature of the stress response [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This also supports recent findings [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] that argue against the role of

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) in an oxidative stress response. The (i) moderate expression levels of

 <italic class="italic"> groEL</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> dnaK</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> groES,</italic> and (iii) elongated cell morphology all indicate that PEO does not primarily induce oxidative stress. On the other hand the elevated expression levels of two alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, AhpC and thiol peroxidase (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>: 8, 11), are however seemingly contradictory. AhpC from
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> was originally described in oxidative stress conditions [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] and recent investigations revealed that it detoxifies the cell from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid hydroperoxides (LPOs) and is involved in biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Genes involved in general and oxidative stress responses are often induced in biofilms, possibly to alleviate the stress generated under such conditions [
