<p class="p">In this study, we showed that PEO exhibited general anti-
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> activity whose effect could be dedicated at least to 5 out of the 9 compounds. During this exposure, the characteristic feature of the evoked stress response was more similar to a general stress response rather than an oxidative one. The response observed was characterized by impaired ability to swarm, downregulation of certain virulence-associated genes, and elongated cell morphology, in contrast to the rounded cell morphology typically observed under oxidative stress conditions. On the contrary, we found that some virulence-associated genes were upregulated. The challenge of future studies will be to identify those individual PEO compounds that can selectively hinder the expression of a repertoire of virulence-associated genes or specifically block different cellular mechanisms. Identification of potential compounds will contribute to the control of this important food-borne pathogen where occurrence of both hypervirulent [
