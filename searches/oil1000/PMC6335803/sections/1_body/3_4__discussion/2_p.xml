<p class="p">In order to reveal the expression changes of the most important virulence-associated genes, we have investigated 23 target genes. These genes are known to be clearly associated with virulence and were used in one of our previous studies [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The varying degrees of influence of this 23 investigated virulence-associated genes suggest that PEO could have an effect on different targets and regulatory routes. The drastic suppression (0,08x) of
 <italic class="italic"> cadF</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> cbf2</italic> (PEB4A) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], 2 characterized adhesive proteins of
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic>, correlates with recent findings where antiadhesive effects of different extracts of
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> on different surfaces were investigated [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. On the other hand, the increased expression of PEB1 [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and PEB3 [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>.), 2 proteins also thought to be involved in adhesion, suggests that PEO might also increase the expression of certain virulence-associated genes.
