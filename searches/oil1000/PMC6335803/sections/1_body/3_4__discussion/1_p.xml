<p class="p">Peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic>) is one of the oldest and most highly regarded herbs for treating gastrointestinal diseases [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. As
 <italic class="italic"> Campylobacter jejuni</italic> is the most frequently reported food-borne pathogen in human gastrointestinal infections worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and the anti-
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> effect of peppermint essential oil (PEO) on two isolates was previously reported [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], we confirmed the anti-
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> effect of PEO on a broader strain collection for the first time. A well-characterized
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> collection, isolated from hospitalized patients [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and 4 widely studied reference strains, was used. The
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> strain NCTC 11168 was used for the more detailed analysis and experiments were carried out between the MIC and MBC values (100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 400 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively) in the sublethal range, as this concentration range is ideal for stress response studies in bacteria [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In our case we have chosen the 150 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> PEO concentration and 10-minute exposition time as this concentration was in the sublethal range and at this timepoint the bacterial cell count was only decreased to 99.5% compared to the starting CFU (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). In pilot it was also revealed that this condition has already induced clearly detectable transcriptomic and proteomic changes.
