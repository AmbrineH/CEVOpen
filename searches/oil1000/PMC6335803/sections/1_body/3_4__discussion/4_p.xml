<p class="p">Treatment with antimicrobial agents is an environmental stress stimulus for bacteria. One typical feature of the
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> stress response is that cells are prone to fall into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state, characterized by rounded cell morphology [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Starvation [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], heat [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], or oxidative stresses [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] also lead to this cell morphology. The straightened cell morphology observed here (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) upon PEO treatment was formerly unreported in wild type strains, although it was observed in
 <italic class="italic"> rpoN</italic> mutants [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Therefore
 <italic class="italic"> rpoN</italic> suppression not only impedes motility, but also affects cell morphology embodied in a linearized, elongated form. The unique stress response induced by PEO treatment differs from another recently studied EO, clove (CEO), that in contrast induces the shortening of
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> cells [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>].
