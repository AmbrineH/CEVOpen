 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic>. It might also repair damaged molecules during general or chemical stresses or simply inactivate toxic molecules explaining the more than 7-fold increase in expression of

 <italic class="italic"> cmeB</italic> also indicates the chemical characteristics of the PEO stress response as RND family transporters are active efflux systems of many antibiotics and chemicals mostly in Gram negative microorganisms [
