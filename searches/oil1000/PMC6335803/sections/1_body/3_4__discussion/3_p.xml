<p class="p">Impaired motility was a clear demonstration that one of the most important virulence traits of
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> was affected by PEO. The molecular background of this phenomenon raises questions, as this outcome is based on the function of a complex machinery consisting of nearly 40 genes [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. The targeted investigation of both structural and regulatory genes from this system has revealed that despite the upregulation of
 <italic class="italic"> flaB</italic> (3.6x)-coding for the subunit protein of the filament,
 <italic class="italic"> flgB</italic> (1.93x)-coding for flagellar basal body protein, and
 <italic class="italic"> flgE2</italic> (2.0x)-coding for the flagellar hook, motility was impaired. The subtle network of these genes is under the control of the three global regulators in
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic>: 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>-70 (RpoD), 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>-54 (RpoN), and 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>-28 (FliA) [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Impaired motility with the slight but steady suppression of
 <italic class="italic"> rpoN</italic> (0.72x) correlates with earlier findings [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] where
 <italic class="italic"> rpoN</italic> mutants lost their motility. Decreased expression influences both structural and chemotactic genes [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] that we also demonstrated with the suppression of
 <italic class="italic"> flhB</italic> (0.79x),
 <italic class="italic"> cheY</italic> (0.84x), and
 <italic class="italic"> docB</italic> (0.75x).
