<p class="p">Stress conditions cause a revved metabolism, which is indicated by elevated energy traffic through the higher expression of three typical enzymes (oxidoreductase, adenylate kinase, and succinyl CoA) (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The stabilization of basic metabolism, a matter of life or death during stress conditions, depends on fast and adequate responses. The unchanged expression levels of all 12 investigated housekeeping genes indicate that components of PEO in the investigated concentration do not express their antimicrobial effect by interfering with basic metabolism.

Maintenance of basic metabolism during stress conditions is crucial, and transcription and elongation factors (EL) bear considerable burden. EL-TU is one of the three prokaryotic ELs and has a role in fast and precise synthesis of proteins [
