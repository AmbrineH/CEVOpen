<p class="p">This observation suggested that there is a difference between the two dominant stress responses evoked by PEO and CEO. The constant expression of the three most important genes (

 <italic class="italic"> sodB</italic>, and
 <italic class="italic"> katA</italic>) involved in oxidative stress responses [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] suggested that cytoplasmic membrane disruption and leakage were not the major antibacterial mode of action of PEO, as was suggested for other EOs [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The marked increase (3.63x, 4.77x, and 10.41x) in the transcription of the three important molecular chaperones (

 <italic class="italic"> groES</italic>, and

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. These three enzymes belong to the heat stress protein family, but have essential roles in osmotic [
