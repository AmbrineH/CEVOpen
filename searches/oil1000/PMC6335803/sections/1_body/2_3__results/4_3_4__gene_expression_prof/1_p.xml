<p class="p">To understand the molecular basis of the impact of PEO treatment on
 <italic class="italic"> C. jejuni</italic> cells, 44 genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Table). General stress genes showed the most marked changes (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Except for
 <italic class="italic"> ahpC</italic> (7.18x) involved in oxidative stress response [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], the dominance of a general stress response was found:
 <italic class="italic"> dnaK </italic>(10.41x) [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>],
 <italic class="italic"> groEL </italic>(3.63x), and
 <italic class="italic"> groES </italic>(4.77x) [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Some of the investigated virulence-associated factors were downregulated while others showed a marked expression compared to that of the control. From the 3 known sigma factors,
 <italic class="italic"> rpoN</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> rpo</italic>D were downregulated, in contrast to
 <italic class="italic"> fliA</italic> which was upregulated by a factor of 1.7, respectively.
