<p class="p">In order to identify the proteins affected by PEO, 10% 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used. Bands that showed marked elevation or decrease in 3 parallel 2D SDS-PAGE runs were analyzed by LC-MS. Two protein bands had a decreased expression level compared to the control sample (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). These bands correspond to proteins involved in the synthesis of two virulence-associated factors: PEB4 [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], a temperature dependent colonization factor, and HtrA, a serine protease with a role in adherence and invasion [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Additionally 10 proteins had an elevated expression level compared to the control (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), including 2 adhesion factors (PEB1 and PEB3) [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], a stress response protein (DnaK) [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], an elongation factor (Tu) [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Elevated expression levels were detected for oxidoreductase [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], and adenylate kinase [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], enzymes with roles in energy metabolism, succinyl CoA, and thiol peroxidase [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], an oxidative stress response protein (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>).
