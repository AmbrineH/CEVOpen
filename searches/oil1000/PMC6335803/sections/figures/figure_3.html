 <p> Soft agar swarming assay of the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 in the presence and lack of PEO at 37 ° C. Without PEO, cells (column A) show strong swarming activity in the 0.3% agar plates, while this feature was impaired in the otherwise sublethal 50 μg mL −1 PEO concentration (column B). No turbidity was observed around the inoculation site in the plates having a 150 μg mL −1 PEO concentration. Plates were incubated for 24 h. </p>
