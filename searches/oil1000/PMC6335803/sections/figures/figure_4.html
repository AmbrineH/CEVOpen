 <p> Thin layer chromatography separation (a) and antibacterial effect of PEO components (b). TLC separated PEO components ((a)/1 st column) were visualized by ethanolic vanillin–sulphuric acid reagent in the presence of reference compounds menthol ((a)/2 nd column), menthone, and isomenthone ((a)/3 rd column). Antibacterial effect of separated PEO components was revealed by bioautography (b). Sample application: (a)/1 st and (b) column, 0.2 μl of PEO (100 μl/500 μl); (a)/2 nd, 1 μl of menthol standard (10 mg/mL); (a)/3 rd, 1 μl of menthone (10 mg/mL) and 1 μl of isomenthone (10 mg/mL) standards. </p>
