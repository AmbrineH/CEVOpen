 <p> Influence of two different peppermint essential oil (PEO) concentrations on the proliferation kinetics of C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168. The applied 150 μg mL −1 concentration of PEO was between the MIC (100 μg mL −1) and MBC (400 μg mL −1) values and proved to be sublethal. In contrast, the 50 μg mL −1 concentration—used in the motility assay—was under the MIC value, having no drastic influence on proliferation. </p>
