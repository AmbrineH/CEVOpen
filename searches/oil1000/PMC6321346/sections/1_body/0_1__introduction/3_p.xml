<p class="p">In recent years, Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SEDDS) have become an increasingly effective possibility for improving the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Self-emulsifying formulations are isotropic mixtures of natural or synthetic oils, lipophilic or hydrophilic surfactants, co-solvent(s) of the poorly water-soluble drug. These anhydrous preconcentrates spontaneously form oil-in-water emulsions upon mild agitation in the stomach [
