<p class="p">The aim of the study was to enhance the poor aqueous solubility and dissolution rate of baicalin via a liquid self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system. Our scope was to find an optimized carrier system for baicalin, and to analyze and characterize the reconstituted nanoemulsion using AFM, droplet size, and Zeta-potential measurements, long-term stability tests, and in vitro dissolution studies. The development of a sample preparation method for AFM imaging of nanosized droplets was also in our interest.</p>
