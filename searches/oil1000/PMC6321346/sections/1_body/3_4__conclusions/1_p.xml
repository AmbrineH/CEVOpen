<p class="p">Dissolution kinetics of baicalin was improved in a self-nanoemulsifying system taking different types of oils, surfactants, co-surfactants, and ideal ratio of components into consideration, based on response surface methodology, using a central composite experimental design. The best composition contains Peceol

A new sample preparation method gave the opportunity to analyze the lyophilized samples without any signs of aggregation of droplets. Droplet size after dispergation of BSNEDDS pre-concentrate was highly desirable, with 86.75 ± 0.3553 nm; the Zeta-potential was −24.3 ± 1.44 mV, which is also acceptable. The results proved that the low aqueous solubility and dissolution rate of baicalin can be significantly improved by the optimized BSNEDDS formula. The pre-concentrate showed very rapid emulsification (within seconds) and nanosized droplets were generated. The future research direction is to convert the optimized liquid BSNEDDS pre-concentrate to various solid carriers and preparing of self-nanoemulsifying matrix pellets using an extrusion-spheronization method.
