 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Thirteen experiments were designed to understand the influence of formulation variables (oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and emulgent:co-emulgent ratios) affecting droplet size, transmittance, zeta-potential, and PDI (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The values of responses Y
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> (Z-avg (nm)), Y
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Transmittance (%)), Y
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (Zeta-potential (mV)), and Y
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (PDI) ranged from 20.3 to 200.8 nm, 78.7 to 100%, −33.8 to −15.9, and 0.25 to 0.69, respectively. The ratio of maximum to minimum for responses Y
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, Y
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Y
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and Y
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was found to be 9.892, 1.271, 0.47, and 2.76, respectively. Power transformation was not required for these responses and no aliases were found for the Quadratic model, and in all cases the Sequential Model Sum of Squares detected the Quadratic model as being significant. The models were validated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), lack of fit, and R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> tests. The Model F values for responses Y
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, Y
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Y
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and Y
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> were 120.36, 66.24, 50.03, and 47.72, respectively, which implied that each model was significant. The final polynomial equations and a summary of the regression analysis on all the responses are presented in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The main effects (
