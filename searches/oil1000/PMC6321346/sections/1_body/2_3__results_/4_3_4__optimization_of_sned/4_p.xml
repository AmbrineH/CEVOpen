<p class="p">All the measured responses were graphically optimized using the optimization module of the software. With multiple responses it is necessary to find regions where requirements simultaneously meet the critical properties. By superimposing or overlaying critical response contours on a contour plot, it is possible to visually search for the best compromise. The minimum and maximum acceptable responses were determined according to the scientific literature: droplet size &lt; 200 nm, transmittance &gt;90%, Zeta-potential &lt; ±20 mV, PDI &lt; 0.40. The overlay plot can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>E, where the area that satisfies the constraints is yellow, while the area that does not meet criteria is grey. We selected our optimized formulation from the middle of the yellow labelled area of the overlay plot. The optimized SNEDDS contained Peceol

Three batches of the optimized formulation were prepared and measured, 52.87 ± 0.5322 nm, 99.87 ± 0.18%, -25.42 ± 0.710 mV, and 0.335 ± 0.004. The predicted and observed values of responses were in very close correlation, indicating the reproducibility of the model.
