<p class="p">Response surface method (RSM) designs help to quantify the relationships between one or more measured responses and the vital input factors. The generated 3D plots show how any of two factors affects the response. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>A displays the effect of oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> (X
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>), emulgent:co-emulgent (X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and their interaction on droplet size (Y
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>). When both oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> (1:8) and emulgent:co-emulgent were low (1:1), a mean droplet size of 27.7 ± 0.12 nm was observed. By increasing oil content while keeping X
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 1:1, droplet size was increased to 200.8 ± 1.64 nm. As the amount of surfactant and co-surfactant mixture increased, so decreased the droplet size. It can be attributed to the fact that strong localization of surface-active agents at the oil–water interface reduces the interfacial free energy. The higher the oil content, the more extensive the total interfacial area to be stabilized, and the amount of surfactant molecules are not sufficient to cover the oil droplets and lower interfacial tension at the oil–water interface. The lowest droplet size (20.3 ± 0.08) was achieved at a low oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> level (1:8) and at high emulgent:co-emulgent ratio (3:1). The 3D response surface plot of transmittance is demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>B. Formulations are considered transparent if the percentage transmittance is above 90%, which is due to the fact that droplet size is not larger than 25% of the wavelength of incident light [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Low level (−1) of oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratios were favourable for producing perfectly transparent nanoemulsions (100% and 99.9%), irrespective of the emulgent:co-emulgent ratio. As the amount of oil decreased in the formulation, the transmittance increased, and vice versa. Examining the responses, the minimum transmittance value (78.7 ± 0.08%) was detected at a high level of oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and at a low level of emulgent:co-emulgent. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>C illustrates the relationship between oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and emulgent:co-emulgent ratios on Zeta-potential. The lowest Zeta-potential (−33.8 ± 0.83 mV) was observed at the middle level of oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and high level of emulgent:co-emulgent ratio. This electrokinetic potential was decreased by decreasing the ratio of co-surfactant. This phenomenon might be explained by the insufficient co-surfactant concentration, because the co-surfactant plays a special role in reduction of interfacial tension and providing flexibility of the interfacial film [
 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The highest Zeta-potential (−15.9 ± 0.72) was detected at high oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and low emulgent:co-emulgent level. The negative surface charge of dispersed nanoemulsions can be explained by the chemical structure of Peceol. Peceol composed of glyceryl monooleate contains free fatty acids, due to manufacturing or hydrolysis of glyceryl monooleate during storage. According to the technical data sheet from the manufacturer, free glycerol content in Peceol is ≤ 6% and acid value is 3.0 mg KOH/g, which meets the requirements of Eur. Ph. and United States Pharmacopoeia (USP). Fatty acids in solutions can deprotonate to carboxylate anions [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>D) pointed out parallel relationships with the droplet size measurements and some differences as well. The emulgent:co-emulgent ratio slightly influenced the polydispersity indices, while the effect of various oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratios were significant (p &lt; 0.001) on PDI. The narrowest droplet size distribution (0.25) was found when oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> was at low level and emulgent:co-emulgent was high. We can conclude that higher oil content of the pre-concentrate produces a nanoemulsion with wider droplet size distribution. The desired PDI value should be less than 0.400, which implies a uniform particle size distribution [
