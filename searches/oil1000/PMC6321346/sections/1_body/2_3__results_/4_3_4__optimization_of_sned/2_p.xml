<p class="p">Analysis of standardized main effects (only significant values 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 are discussed) showed that droplet size (Y
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) was affected by the synergistic effect of oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio, antagonistically influenced by emulgent:co-emulgent ratio, the interaction term between oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and emulgent:co-emulgent ratio, and quadratic terms of oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio. Transmittance (Y
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was synergistically affected by emulgent:co-emulgent ratio and interaction between oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> and emulgent:co-emulgent ratio, and an antagonistic effect was found with oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio. In the case of Zeta potential (Y
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), we found a positive correlation with oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio and its quadratic term, and a negative correlation with emulgent:co-emulgent ratio. PDI (Y
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) showed a significant synergistic effect with oil:S
 <sub class="sub">mix</sub> ratio and emulgent:co-emulgent ratio. Based on these results, it is obvious that all the factors contribute in determining the characteristics of SNEDDS.
