<p class="p">Selection of a surfactant depends on several factors, such as solubilizing capacity for the API, the efficiency and rapidity of emulsification of the oil, and safety [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Non-ionic surfactants are considered less toxic than ionic ones. Due to these considerations, we analyzed five non-ionic surfactants with various hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values. The highest solubility of baicalin was obtained in Labrasol
