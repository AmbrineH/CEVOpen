<p class="p">After oral administration of SNEDDS, nanoemulsion formation upon dilution takes place in vivo. It is a relevant aspect to demonstrate that uniform nanoemulsions are formed in terms of various dilutions, and these nanoemulsified systems do not show any sign of phase separation or precipitation. The drug may precipitate in vivo at higher dilutions, which might significantly affect drug absorption [

All emulsions were found to be in the acceptable nanoemulsion region (Z-avg. &lt; 200 nm, T &gt; 90%, PDI &lt; 0.4), proving their robustness to dilution. After 24 h of inspection, neither phase separation, nor precipitation, was observed. In vitro results showed that BSNEDDS in different dilutions form uniform nanoemulsions and drug solubility in BSNEDDS was adequate (no precipitation).
