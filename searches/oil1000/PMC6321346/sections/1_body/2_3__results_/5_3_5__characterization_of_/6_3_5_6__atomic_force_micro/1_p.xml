<p class="p">Lyophilized nanodroplets were dispersed homogeneously on a mica surface, showing no signs of aggregation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>A). They appeared as circular objects with smooth surfaces and a rounded topography (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>B), which corresponds well to what one would expect from a surface adsorbed droplet. Height of particles followed a slightly right skewed distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>C). Lack of outstandingly large particle sizes indicate that droplets did not coalesce during sample preparation. Mean height of droplets (±SD) was 15.4 ± 9.0 nm, which was lower than the diameter (52.87 ± 0.5322 nm) obtained from DLS data. This may stem from two factors: (1) Flattening of emulsion droplets on the mica surface, or (2) the fact that DLS yields the hydrodynamic size of the droplets, which is bigger than the real particle diameter. Since the diameter of surface adsorbed droplets is about two times larger than their height (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>A), at first sight one would think there was a considerable flattening indeed. However, a tip convolution artefact on its own can result in this extent of artefactual apparent widening of the vesicle diameter, with the tip radius being approximately 9 nm.
