<p class="p">To estimate the diameter of the original fluid-phase emulsion droplets, volume of surface-adsorbed droplets was determined. From this, the real diameter of fluid phase droplets could be calculated, assuming that they have spherical shape and there is no volume change upon surface-adsorption. Estimated fluid phase droplet radius showed an apparent normal distribution with 23.6 ± 12.0 nm as mean ± SD (
