<p class="p">The thermodynamic solubility of baicalin in optimized SNEDDS was 2714.3 ± 113.8 µg/mL. It indicated 40.5-times solubility improvement correlated with solubility in distilled water (67.0 ± 1.6 µg/mL). The hydrophobic API favoured being dissolved in the droplet of nanoemulsion, and this state (preceded by filtration and dispergation) was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy.</p>
