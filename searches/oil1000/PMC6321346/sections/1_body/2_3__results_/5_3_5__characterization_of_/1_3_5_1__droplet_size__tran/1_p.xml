<p class="p">The droplet size, transmittance, PDI, and Zeta-potential of optimized BSNEDDS was measured. It is a well-known fact that droplet size is an essential feature and can significantly influence the in vivo fate of a nanoemulsion. The globule size of an emulsion also determines the rate and extent of drug release [

The Z-avg was highly desirable with 86.75 ± 0.3553 nm, likewise the PDI value with 0.403 ± 0.007, indicating that the system had narrow droplet size distribution and indicating improved drug dissolution kinetics. Transmittance of the diluted sample was 99.93 ± 0.13%. In general, when the Zeta-potential of an emulsion is high (&gt; ±20 mV), the repulsive forces exceed the attractive forces, resulting in a relatively stable system. The long-term stability of a nanoemulsified system can be estimated by examining the fluctuation of the Zeta-potential [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The Zeta-potential of optimized BSNEDDS was −24.3 ± 1.44 mV and the specific conductivity was found to be 0.0135 ± 0.002 mS/cm.
