<p class="p">We confirm that some features of unloaded SNEDDS have changed due to drug loading, but the experiments supported the suitability of loaded SNEDDS to deliver baicalin. PDI and droplet size were compared at two pH values in case of both unloaded and loaded SNEDDS (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) to demonstrate the effect of pH and highlight if there is any difference between the formulas due to drug loading. From the results it is clear that pH has no effect on droplet size and PDI, but drug loading has a consequence. The colloid dispersion formed from loaded SNEDDS undoubtedly meets the quality criteria and characteristics for a nanoemulsion (droplet size &lt; 200 nm, PDI &lt; 0.40). It was pointed out that the drug itself didnâ€™t influence the self-dispersing process, as dilution with a dispersing media self-emulsification takes place in seconds.
