<p class="p">The long-term physical stability of BSNEDDS was evaluated by droplet size, PDI measurements, and macroscopic emulsion observation for a month. There are a lot of various physicochemical phenomena which can lead to the breakdown of a nanoemulsion (e.g., creaming, flocculation, Ostwald ripening), but these undesirable mechanisms can be identified. According to our analysis there was no significant change in droplet size and/or PDI over the investigated period compared to initial values. The visual observation revealed no phase separation, creaming, or precipitation. The o/w baicalin containing nanoemulsion demonstrated high physical stability. The results of the long-term stability study are illustrated in
