 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The ternary phase diagram was constructed based on solubility and emulsification studies to identify the nanoemulsifying region (Z-avg &lt; 200 nm, T% &gt; 90%), and the composition also helps to determine the concentration range of components for the formation of a nanoemulsion. Compositions containing more than 22% oil phase were found to be out of the nanoemulsifying region. It was observed that at least 40% surfactant is required for producing droplets under 200 nm.
