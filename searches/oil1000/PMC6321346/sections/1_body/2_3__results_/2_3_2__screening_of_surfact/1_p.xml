<p class="p">Three emulgents with various molecular structures and HLB-values were chosen in order to screen their ability to emulsify the oily phase by droplet size (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). The droplet size of emulsions of Labrasol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> and Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL demonstrated reduction with increased emulgent content, while Labrafil
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> M 1944 CS did not indicate any significant droplet size shift when mixed with various oil ratios. All Labrasol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>-containing formulations demonstrated unacceptable self-emulsification efficiency and turbid systems were generated. Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL showed the best emulsification ability and produced the most desired droplets with 151 ± 1.2871 nm at Peceol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL 1:6 
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> ratio. Turbidity analysis revealed a clear augmentation of transmittance with increased oil:emulgent ratios for Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL and Labrasol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, however Labrafil
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> M 1944 CS expressed a sharp decline. It has been reported that the required HLB value to form o/w nanoemulsion is greater than 10 [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The very poor emulsifying ability of Labrafil
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> M 1944 CS can be attributed to its low HLB-value (HLB = 3). Labrasol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (HLB = 14) exhibited better affinity for the oil phase compared to Labrafil
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> M 1944 CS, although the best compatibility was shown with Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL (HLB = 12). This indicates that nanoemulsification was also influenced by other factors besides HLB value, such as the chemical structure, saturation, and chain length of the surfactant [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL has an inhibitory impact on different CYP-enzymes and on intestinal P-glycoprotein, which are desirable to enhance the bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We have selected Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL as giving the greatest transmittance and lowest droplet size with increased oil:emulgent ratios. In consideration of the aforementioned results and observations, we can conclude that Peceol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Kolliphor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL, and Transcutol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> P is the best choice for designing baicalin containing SNEDDS.
