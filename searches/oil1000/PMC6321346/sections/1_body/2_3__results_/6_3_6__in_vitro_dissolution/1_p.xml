<p class="p">In vitro dissolution profiles of BSNEDDS pre-concentrate and baicalin in pH = 1.2 and pH = 6.8 dissolution media are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00275-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>. It was observed that baicalin loaded nanodroplets were rapidly dispersed in the media (within 5 min) irrespective of pH of the dissolution media, and 100% of baicalin was dissolved in nanodroplets. In contrast, the pure drug showed much lower dissolution rates for the initial period of 5 min at both pH values. It was proved that the dissolution rate of baicalin is significantly lower in the case of pH 1.2 correlated to pH 6.8, which can be explained by its pH-dependent solubility.
