<p class="p">The liquid formula showed spontaneous nanoemulsification and there was no sign of phase separation or phase inversion of nanoemulsion after storage for 24 h. The nanoemulsion formation was successful because of the low PDI values (PDI
 <sub class="sub">pH=1.2</sub>: 0.321 ± 0.002, PDI
 <sub class="sub">pH=6.8</sub>: 0.347 ± 0.003) in both dissolution medias, indicating narrow droplet size distribution. The droplet size was also detected and showed adequate results: Z-avg
 <sub class="sub">pH=1.2</sub>: 84.93 ± 0.3235 nm, Z-avg
 <sub class="sub">pH=6.8</sub>: 86.67 ± 0.2956 nm. On the grounds of in vitro dissolution studies and reconstitution analysis, we can declare that a remarkable dissolution rate and solubilization improvement was achieved, and total amount of incorporated baicalin was dispersed in homogeneous size distribution nanoemulsified droplets.
