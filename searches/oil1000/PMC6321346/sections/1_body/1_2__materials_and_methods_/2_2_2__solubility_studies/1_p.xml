<p class="p">The thermodynamic solubility of baicalin was determined in distilled water, different oils, emulgents, and co-emulgents by saturation shake-flask method with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-10-00275" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Firstly, an excess amount of baicalin was added to 2 g of each excipient in sealed vials. All samples were stirred (approx. 500 rpm) and thermostated (IKA RT-5 power heatable magnetic stirrer, IKA Work Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 h. Secondly a cycle of sedimentation (to achieve separation of the excess solid from the solution) was carried out for 24 h at 37 ± 1 °C. To improve the efficacy of phase-separation, the saturated supernatant of samples was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min using a centrifuge (Herolab MicroGen 16, Herolab GmbH, Wiesloch, Germany) followed by removal of the incidentally undissolved baicalin from the supernatant by filtering it with a nylon membrane filter (0.22 μm, 25 mm, FilterBio
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> NY, Labex Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). Samples were suitably diluted with absolute ethanol and drug concentration was obtained via UV spectroscopy at wavelength 279 nm using equivalent proportions of excipients as blank (Agilent 8453 UV-Visible Spectrophotometer, Agilent Technologies Ltd., Santa Clara, CA, USA). All experiments were repeated three times and results were calculated from the linear calibration of baicalin in absolute ethanol (R
