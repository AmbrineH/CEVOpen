 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic> ratios (1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6) were created, and selection of the emulgent was based on the results of droplet size and transmittance analysis. Briefly, 1 g of pre-concentrate was prepared in sufficient quantities, gently stirred, and heated to 37 ± 1 °C, promoting the homogenization process. The isotropic mixture, 0.1 mL, which was accurately weighed and diluted to 100 mL with distilled water, yielded fine emulsions. Emulsions were equilibrated for 2 h at room temperature before measuring their transmittance by Agilent 8453 UV-Visible Spectrophotometer at wavelength 633 nm using distilled water as blank. The droplet size (Z-avg) distributions and polydispersity indices were measured by DLS (dynamic light scattering) method with the instrument Zetasizer Nano ZS
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). Measurement settings were: automatic mode, NIBS (none-invasive-back-scattering) 173°, 30 sub runs/measurements, run duration of 10 s, automatic laser position selected, 4.65 mm position from the bottom of the cuvette, attenuation setting of attenuator 9 was selected automatically. Five measurements with 30 runs were performed for every sample and the mean ± SD values are reported in this article for all DLS parameters, including intensity-weighted mean hydrodynamic diameters (Z-avg) and polydispersity indices (PDI).
