<p class="p">Dissolution testing was performed using the Hanson SR-8 Plus
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> Dissolution Test Station (Hanson Research, Los Angeles, CA, USA) by the paddle (United States Pharmacopeia apparatus 2) method at 50 rpm and 37 ± 0.2 °C. The formulations were screened in 500 mL of aqueous-based dissolution media at pH 1.2 (Ph.Eur.9.) and pH 6.8 (Ph.Eur.9.). Pure baicalin and liquid BSNEDDS (equivalent to 5 mg of baicalin) were exposed to the media, and at predetermined time-points, 5 mL of samples were withdrawn and filtered from the media through 5 µm pore size membrane full-flow filters by Hanson AutoPlus Multifill collector (Hanson Research). After every sampling, media replacement was accomplished with 5 mL of fresh buffer solution. Dissolution studies were completed in triplicate and the dissolved drug content (%) ± SD was analyzed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry at 279 nm against equivalent proportions of excipients as blank. Withdrawn and filtered samples were characterized for droplet size and PDI as described for liquid BSNEDDS in

The hydrophobic API favours being dissolved in the droplet of nanoemulsion, and this state (preceded by filtration and dispergation) was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy.
