<p class="p">The optimized formulation was evaluated for robustness of dilution. The pre-concentrate was diluted to 50, 100, 500, and 1000 times by distilled water in 100 mL Erlenmeyer-beakers with continuous stirring at 37 ± 1 °C. Distribution parameters were measured using the dynamic light scattering method as described above (
