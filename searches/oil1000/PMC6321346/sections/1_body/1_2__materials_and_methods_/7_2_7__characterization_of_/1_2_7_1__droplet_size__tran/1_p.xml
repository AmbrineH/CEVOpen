 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-pharmaceutics-10-00275" class="xref">Section 2.3</xref>. Zeta-potential was measured using the Zetasizer Nano ZS
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) by diluting 0.1 mL of optimized BSNEDDS with 100 mL of distilled water. The evaluation was based on Laser Doppler Micro-electrophoresis using the Smoluchowski model. The selection of the attenuator level and the position of the optics was set automatically. The instrument was operated by automatic selection of voltage based on the measured conductivity of the sample. The analysis was carried out at 37.0 °C in clear, disposable folded-capillary zeta cells. Five measurements with minimum 10 runs/sample were performed for each sample, the mean values ± SD (mV) are reported.
