<p class="p">Cloudpoint is the temperature above which an aqueous solution of a water-soluble surfactant becomes turbid. The optimized formula was diluted with distilled water to 100 times and placed in a water bath where the temperature was increased gradually (1.0 Â°C/min). Cloudpoint was recorded as the temperature at which the diluted formulation turned cloudy (visual perception). </p>
