<p class="p">The BSNEDDS pre-concentrate was diluted 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup>-fold with distilled water. Five µL of this emulsion was dropped on a freshly cleaved mica surface and was frozen by pouring approximately 30 mL liquid N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> onto it. The sample was immediately placed in the lyophilizator chamber (CoolSafe
 <sup class="sup">™</sup> 110-04 freeze dryer, ScanVac, Lillerød, Denmark), pre-cooled to −60 °C, and lyophilized at the following parameters: 10 min freezing at −40 °C, then drying at 0.020 hPa vacuum chamber pressure for 18 h. The shelf temperature was set at 15 °C for 1 h, 20 °C for 1 h, 30 °C for 8 h, and 40 °C for 4 h. Freeze-dried samples were stored protected from light at ambient humidity at 25 ± 1 °C and examined within 4 h of the end of the lyophilization process.
