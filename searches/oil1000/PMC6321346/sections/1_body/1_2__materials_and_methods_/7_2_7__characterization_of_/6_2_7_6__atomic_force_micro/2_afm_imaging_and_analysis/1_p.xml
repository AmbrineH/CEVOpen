<p class="p">Lyophilized samples were imaged in non-contact mode with a Cypher S instrument (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) at 1–2 Hz line-scanning rate in air using a silicon cantilever (OMCL AC-160TS, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and oscillated at its resonance frequency (typically 300–320 kHz). Temperature during the measurements was 29 ± 1 °C. Images were analyzed by using the built-in algorithms of the AFM driving software (IgorPro, WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR, USA). AFM amplitude-contrast images are shown in this paper. To determine height variations, height-contrast data were used.</p>
