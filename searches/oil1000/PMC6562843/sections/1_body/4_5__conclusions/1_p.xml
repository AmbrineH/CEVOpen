<p class="p">The results reported in the present study indicated that the inclusion of pomegranate pulp in the diet of grazing ewes did not affect milk yield and gross composition during late lactation. However, dietary pomegranate pulp enriched the milk with healthy fatty acids such as RA, VA, and punicic acid. These findings suggest that recycling pomegranate pulp as feedstuffs to reduce conventional concentrates could reduce both the feeding costs during a less profitable phase, such as the late lactation, and the feed-to-food competition in livestock production. Our results could be of particular interest in some areas, such as the Mediterranean, where lambing seasons are managed in order to concentrate most of the lactation when pasture is abundant, while late lactation occurs when summer approaches and pasture availability and quality decline, and therefore concentrate feeds and hay are necessary to meet nutrient requirements. These conditions contribute to reduce the quality of milk produced during late lactation, and the administration of dietary pomegranate pulp could represent a valid strategy to maintain a high level of milk quality. Further study should be done to assess the effect of dietary pomegranate pulp during a different phase of lactation. Finally, it would be of interest to clarify the role of the punicic acid and of tannins in the mechanism that led to an increased percentage of RA and VA in the milk of the PP group.</p>
