<p class="p">Pomegranate pulp is one of the by-products produced during pomegranate juice extraction and consists of variable proportions of peel, seeds, and residual pulp. The content of fiber, crude protein, and fat makes this by-product a suitable feed to be included at a high percentage in the diet of ruminants. Therefore, the recycling of pomegranate pulp as an ingredient of ruminant feeds could contribute to the reduction in the feed-to-food competition of animal production by replacing potentially human-edible feeds such as cereals and, at the same time, could represent a viable strategy to reduce the disposal costs for the industry. In addition, the residual bioactive compounds could improve rumen protein metabolism or impair the biohydrogenation of dietary PUFA [

These properties might be of particular interest in some areas, such as the Mediterranean, to attenuate the impact of the seasonal availability of good quality pasture on the yield and composition of sheep milk, or during late lactation when milk yield and quality physiologically degrade.
