<p class="p">Agro-industrial by-products of pomegranate have been investigated to evaluate the effect on ruminal fermentation, performance, and product quality in large [

 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. However, recent research has only focused on the effect of pomegranate by-products obtained from single parts of the fruit. In contrast, the whole pomegranate pulp, where all the above-described phytochemicals are present at once, has been scarcely investigated. Therefore, only the effects of feeding PP silage has been investigated in cow milk and lamb meat production [

 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, pomegranate pulp has not been previously tested on dairy ewes. In the light of above, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of dietary pomegranate pulp on the yield and quality of milk from grazing ewes in advanced stage of lactation.
