 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] using a Beckman P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis system controlled by 32 Karat software, version 8.0 (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA), equipped with an UV detector set at 214 nm and an uncoated fused silica capillary (57 cm length, 50 μm i.d., 375 μm O.D., slit opening 100 × 800 μm) (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA). The distance between the window and the outlet was 10 cm resulting in an effective capillary length of 47 cm. The sample solutions were injected for 20 s at 0.5 psi. Electrophoresis runs were carried out at 45 °C with a linear voltage gradient from 0 to 25 kV in 3 min, followed by a constant voltage at 25 kV. The sample buffer (pH 8.6 ± 0.1) was 167 mM hydroxymethyl-aminomethane, 42 mM 3-morpholinopropanesulphonic acid, 67 mM ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid disodium salt dehydrate, 17 mM
