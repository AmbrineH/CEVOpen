<p class="p">Fat from feeds and individual milk samples was extracted with a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, vol/vol) as described by Folch et al. [

 <xref rid="B20-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] using 0.5 mL of sodium methoxide in methanol 0.5 N and 1 mL of hexane. Nonadecanoic acid (19:0) was used as an internal standard. Gas chromatographic analysis was carried out according to Valenti et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] using a Trace Thermo Finningam GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) (ThermoQuest, Milan, Italy) and 100-m high polar fused silica capillary column (25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm, film thickness) SP 24056 (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium was the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL/min and samples were injected at a 1:80 split ratio. The GC conditions were: 40 °C oven temperature held for 4 min, then increased to 120 °C at 10 °C/min and held for 1 min, then increased up to 180 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 18 min, then increased up to 200 °C at 2 °C/min and held for 15 min, and then increased up to 230 °C at 2 °C/min and held for 19 min. The injector and detector temperatures were 270 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The individual fatty acid peaks were identified by comparison of retention times with those of a known mixture created by mixing a 52 components FAME mix (Nu-Chek Prep. Inc., Elysian, MN, USA) and individual FAME standards (Sigma-Aldrich) run under the same operative conditions. Milk fatty acids were expressed as g/100 g of total fatty acids.
