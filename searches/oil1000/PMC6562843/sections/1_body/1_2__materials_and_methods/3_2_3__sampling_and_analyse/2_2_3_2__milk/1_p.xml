<p class="p">Individual milk samples were collected weekly and subdivided into two aliquots. One aliquot was immediately analyzed for fat, protein, casein, and lactose by infrared method (Milkoscan 6000 FT, Foss Electric, Hillerød, Denmark), and total SCC by Fossomatic 5000 (Foss Electric, Hillerød Denmark) and expressed as a linear score (linear score = log2(SCC/12.500)), while the other aliquot was stored at −80 °C pending analyses.</p>
