 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00283-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> reports the effect of dietary treatment on the milk antioxidant capacity. The results of the ORAC assay showed that the H-ORAC accounted for most of the TAC in milk as compared with the L-ORAC. Dietary treatment affected the TAC, with higher values found in the CTRL group as compared with the PP (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.006). These differences in the TAC values were due to the effect of the dietary treatment on the antioxidant capacity measured in the H-ORAC, which were higher for the CTRL group as compared with the PP group (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002). Conversely, no difference between treatments was observed for L-ORAC.
