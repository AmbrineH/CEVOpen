 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9 14:1, and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9 16:1 were greater in the CTRL than in the PP milk. In contrast, the percentages of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-9 18:1, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-11 18:1 (VA), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-6 18:1, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-11 18:2 (RA), and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-15 18:3 (ALA) were greater in the PP than the CTRL group. Punicic acid was detected only in the milk of PP ewes, representing 0.19% of total milk fatty acids. Regarding the sums of fatty acids, the CTRL milk showed a greater percentage of SFA and a lower proportion of PUFA. Moreover, the CTRL milk had a lower percentage of total PUFA n-3. The dietary treatment did not affect the sum of MUFA, odd and branched chain fatty acids (OBCFA), and PUFA n-6.
