In the present study, PA accounted for 60% of the total fatty acids in the PP concentrate, while it represented only 0.2% of milk fatty acids. Considering that PA in milk exclusively arises from the ingested diet, it is likely that PA was extensively biohydrogenated in the rumen of PP ewes. The ruminal biohydrogenation pathway of PA has not yet been reported. However, it is plausible that, similar to the biohydrogenation of linoleic acid (LA) and ALA [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], VA and RA are intermediates of PA biohydrogenation. In line with this hypothesis, the proportion of VA and RA was higher in the PP milk.
