<p class="p">Both direct and indirect antioxidant mechanisms of phenolic compounds in vivo have been suggested. A direct effect is linked to the possibility that these compounds are absorbed in the gut in order to reach the tissues. It has been reported that phenols with a low molecular weight can be absorbed and transferred to the blood stream [

 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], which, differently from the condensed tannins, can be degraded by rumen microbes. Therefore, it is likely that small products of degradation of pomegranate tannins can be absorbed. Consistently, Kotsampasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] showed that the total phenols in lamb meat were linearly correlated to the level of pomegranate silage inclusion in the diet of growing lambs. However, in the same paper, though the meat antioxidant capacity was greater in the groups receiving the pomegranate silage, it was not linearly correlated to the presence of phenols in meat, suggesting that the accumulation of antioxidant molecules is not the only mechanism responsible for the antioxidant capacity of the animal products.
