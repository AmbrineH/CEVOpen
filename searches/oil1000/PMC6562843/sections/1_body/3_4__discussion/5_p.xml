<p class="p">The availability of essential amino acids (EAA) represents the most limiting factor for the endogenous biosynthesis of milk protein in the mammary gland. According to Orlandi et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], feeding tannins to ruminants increased the flux of EAA through the abomasum and to the duodenum [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] with positive effects on milk protein yield. Surprisingly, our results contradict these observations. This is the first study reporting the effect of dietary pomegranate by-products on milk protein profile, and the lack of knowledge on the effect of dietary polyphenols on individual milk proteins does not allow a comparison with the literature. However, in a similar study, dietary chestnut hydrolysable tannins increased protein yield and casein index without affecting individual caseins in the milk from ewes during mid-lactation [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. A possible explanation for the lower percentage of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-CN in the PP group could be the greater somatic cell count, expressed as LS, observed in PP milk. It is known that LS is positively correlated with the activity of plasmin, a protease that degrades 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-CN into γ-CN. Although the effect of plasmin is evident at values of LS greater than those recorded for both the groups in the present study, it cannot be excluded as a possible cause of the lower 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-CN and total casein in PP milk.
