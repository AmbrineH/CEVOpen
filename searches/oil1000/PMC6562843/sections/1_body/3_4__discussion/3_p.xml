<p class="p">Controversial results are reported on the effect of dietary pomegranate by-products on milk yield and composition. Kotsampasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] did not observe a variation of DMI, milk yield, and gross composition when 75 or 150 g/kg of pomegranate silage were included in the diet of lactating cows. A similar result was observed by Modaresi et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] in lactating goats with the inclusion of 60 or 120 g/kg of pomegranate seed pulp. In contrast, Shaani et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] found that when 8% of ensiled PP replaced corn grain in a total mixed ration it reduced DMI and milk yield in cows, while lambs refused to consume a TMR containing more than 20% of pomegranate by-product [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In the present trial, PP concentrate was completely consumed, despite the fact that the level of PP inclusion was greater than values reported in the literature and the tannins content was 61 g/kg DM. Moreover, no effects on milk yield, fat and protein percentage, and urea content were observed.
