<p class="p">With respect to milk fatty acids, PP milk had a greater percentage of total PUFA and PUFA n-3 and a lower proportion of 14:0, 16:0, and total SFA. Similar results were reported when pomegranate seeds oil [

 <xref rid="B8-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] were added to the diet of goats. The reduction of total and individual SFA in milk and meat is a common result when dietary sources of PUFA are included in the diet of ruminants [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. A high quantity of 14:0 and 16:0 in foods is considered harmful for human health because they increase the atherogenic and the thrombogenic index. Therefore, the inclusion of PP in ruminant diet could be a valid strategy to improve the healthiness of milk by reducing these undesirable FA in favor of healthy FA such as PUFA and PUFA n-3.
