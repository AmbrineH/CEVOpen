<p class="p">In the present study, 648 g/kg DM dried pomegranate pulp was included in a pelleted feed given to grazing ewes in order to evaluate the effect of dietary pomegranate by-product on milk yield and quality traits during late lactation. According to Cannas et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], it was estimated that that the ingestion of the individual ewe was about 2.3 kg, and therefore the pomegranate pulp represented about 7% of total dry matter intake (DMI). The chemical composition of PP used in the present paper was in the range reported for similar pomegranate by-products [

 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The crude fat of PP mostly arises from the seed oil, and therefore, it is not surprising that PA was the most abundant fatty acid in the fat of PP. The total phenolic compounds of pomegranate pulp were represented mainly by tannins, which is consistent with previous study [
