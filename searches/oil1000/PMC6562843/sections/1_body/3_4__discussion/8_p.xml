<p class="p">Other authors found that the improvement in antioxidant capacity of different tissues was not related to a direct transfer of phenolic compounds from the diet [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], suggesting that the antioxidant activity of dietary phenolic compounds could be indirectly mediated by an effect on the overall oxidative status of the animal organism. The balance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant components is an important factor affecting the antioxidant properties of animal products. In particular, the oxidation of susceptible compounds, such as PUFA, is prevented by endogenous defense systems and antioxidants of direct and indirect derivation from the diet. Zulueta et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] reported that the major peroxyl radical scavengers in milk are the caseins, among which 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-CN is the most prominent [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. On the one hand, this could partially explain the higher H-ORAC values found in CTRL milk, which had a greater percentage of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-CN and total casein as compared with PP. On the other hand, PP milk had a higher percentage of both total PUFA and PUFA n-3. Therefore, it may also be supposed that, as compared with CTRL, anti-oxidants could have been consumed more in the PP milk, in order to counteract the higher susceptibility of PUFA to oxidation.
