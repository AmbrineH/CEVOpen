<p class="p">There are many reports that tannins can protect dietary PUFA from the biohydrogenation [

 <xref rid="B40-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. On the one hand, our results could lead to the conclusion that the protective effect of tannins on the dietary punicic acid occurred minimally. On the other hand, looking at the fatty acid composition of the experimental concentrates, an effect of tannins on the biohydrogenation cannot be excluded. The CTRL concentrate was richer in LA and ALA as compared with PP, and therefore a greater percentage of these two fatty acids would have been expected in the CTRL milk. However, ALA was greater in PP milk, while LA was comparable between the groups. According to Chilliard et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], LA and ALA represent the elective substrates for biohydrogenation. Thus, it could be supposed that the biohydrogenation of these compounds occurred normally in the rumen of CTRL ewes, while it was reduced in the PP group.
