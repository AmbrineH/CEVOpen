<p class="p">This inconsistency among the studies could be due to several factors. In their review, Jeronimo et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] stated that the species used in the different trials may show a variable sensitivity to the astringent sensation induced by the type and quantity of tannins in the feeds. Min et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] indicated that a dose of dietary tannins greater than 50 g/kg DM can reduce the voluntary feed intake and animal performance, however, this limit should be applied to the total ingested diet and not to a specific component. Finally, the potential of tannins to improve animal performance seems to depend also on the physiological status of the animals. Waghorn [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00283" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] reported that the surplus of protein escaping the rumen, generated by the protective action of tannins, is better exploited by ewes which have greater protein requirements as compared with less productive animals. Interestingly, we observed that the dietary treatment affected individual milk proteins percentage. In particular,
