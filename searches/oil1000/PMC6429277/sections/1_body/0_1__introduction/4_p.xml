 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In the present work, we evaluated the toxicity of BEO on larvae of the filariasis,

 <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic> L. and larvae of the noctuid moth 
 <italic class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (Boisduval). In addition, its impact on non-target organisms, such as the aquatic microcrustacean 
 <italic class="italic">Daphnia magna</italic> Straus, was assessed. The chemical composition of BEO was obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the isomer of ascaridole was ascertained by
