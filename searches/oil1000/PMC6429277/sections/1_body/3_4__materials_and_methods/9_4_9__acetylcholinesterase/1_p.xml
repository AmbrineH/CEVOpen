<p class="p">Inhibition of AChE activity of BEO was measured following the method of Ellmann with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Briefly, aliquots of BEO diluted in methanol were mixed with 50 μL of 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8, 125 μL of dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB, 3 mM in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8) and 25 μL of AChE from electric eel, 3 U/mL in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8) and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Then, 25 μL of the substrate acetylthiocholine iodide (ACTI, 15 mM in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0) were added and AChE activity was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 412 nm (at 25 °C for 3.0 min) with a Fluostar Omega (BMG-Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) plate reader. Galantamine (Sigma, Milan, Italy) was used as a reference substance. Results were expressed as galantamine-equivalent inhibition capacity (GEIC), indicating the mg of galantamine equivalents (GE) per g of BEO. Each experiment was replicated three times.
