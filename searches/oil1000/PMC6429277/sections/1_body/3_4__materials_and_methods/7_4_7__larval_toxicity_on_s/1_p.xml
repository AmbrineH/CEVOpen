<p class="p">The acute toxicity of BEO and α-cypermethrin, measured as mortality after 24 h of exposure, was determined by topical application on larvae (weight ranging from 20 to 25 mg) of 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> (3rd instar) following our earlier method [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Boldo EO was diluted in 1 μL of acetone at doses of 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 μg·larva
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Four groups, each composed of 20 larvae, were tested for each dose. Acetone was the negative control and α-cypermethrin (Vaztak®) at 0.005, 0.008, 0.01, 0.015 and 0.02 μg·larva
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was used as the positive control. After treatment, larvae were transferred to a recovery box (10 × 10 × 7 cm) for 24 h for mortality determination. Laboratory conditions were 25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 3% R.H. and 16:8 h (L:D) during both rearing and toxicity tests. Death was recorded when the larvae did not respond to prodding with forceps.
