 <italic class="italic">D. magna</italic> adults (2–5 days old) were used as a non-target organisms to assess the impact of BEO on aquatic invertebrates, also testing α-cypermethrin as positive control. Twenty

 <italic class="italic">D. magna</italic> per treatment. 
 <italic class="italic">D. magna</italic> individuals were placed in containers with 250 mL of pure water, and BEO or α-cypermethrin was then mixed into the water at concentrations corresponding to the LC

 <italic class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae (for EO = 96 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and for α-cypermethrin = 0.025 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The chemicals were emulsified using DMSO (in the ratio 1:1). Mortality was calculated after 24 and 48 h. Laboratory conditions were 25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 3% R.H. and 16:8 h (L:D) during both rearing and toxicity tests.
