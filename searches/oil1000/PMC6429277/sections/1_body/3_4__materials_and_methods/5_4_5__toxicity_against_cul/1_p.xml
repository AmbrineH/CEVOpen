<p class="p">The acute toxicity, measured as mortality after 24 h of exposure, was determined on 3rd instar larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>. Mosquito larvicidal assays were carried out according to WHO Standard Procedures, with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For experimental treatment, 1 mL DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) of serial dilutions of BEO (10, 25, 50, 70, 80, 90 and 100 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was added to 224 mL of distilled water in a 500-mL glass bowl and shaken lightly to ensure a homogenous test solution. The selected larvae (25 larvae per concentration, 4 replicates) were transferred in water into a bowl of prepared test solution with a final surface area of 125 cm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Distilled water containing the same amount of DMSO used to test EO was used as negative control and α-cypermethrin (Vaztak®) was used as the positive control (concentrations: 0.001, 0.003, 0.005, 0.008, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). After 24 h treatment mortality was determined. Laboratory conditions were 25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 3% R.H. and 16:8 h (L:D) during both rearing and toxicity tests.
