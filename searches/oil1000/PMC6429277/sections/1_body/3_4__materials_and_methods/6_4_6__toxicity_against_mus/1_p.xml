 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (20 adults per concentration, 4 replicates) using a microelectric applicator. Acetone was the negative control and α-cypermethrin (Vaztak®) at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1.2 μg·adult
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was used as the positive control. Post-treatment, females were transferred to a recovery box (10 × 10 × 12 cm) for 24 h and mortality was determined. Laboratory conditions were 25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 3% R.H. and 16:8 h (L:D) during both rearing and toxicity tests.
