 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00879-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> reports the chemical profile of BEO, where a total of 67 components, accounting for 98.9% of the whole composition, were identified by GC-MS, using two columns of different polarity for separation (i.e. HP-5MS and DB-WAX). The oil was dominated by monoterpenoids (50 compounds identified, 93.8%), with hydrocarbons (51.4%) prevailing on oxygen-containing compounds (42.4%) (

 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>- and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-, 9.1%) and β-phellandrene (6.4%). Other monoterpenoids occurring in appreciable amounts (≥2%) were α-pinene (4.9%), terpinen-4-ol (3.1%), α-terpineol (2.9%), sabinene (2.4%) and α-terpinene (2.0%). The sesquiterpene fraction was rather poor (16 compounds identified, 4.6%), with any compound exceeding 1%.
