<p class="p">Taken together, our findings indicate that the analyzed BEO can be considered a relatively safe pest and vector control product, due to the low content of ascaridole (toxic to vertebrates), thus presenting a potential use in the area of botanical insecticide development. Starting from the present data showing low inhibition of AChE triggered by BEO, further studies are necessary to shed light on its modes of action, with special reference to the potential inhibition of GABA-gated chloride channels and/or binding to octopamine receptors, as well as to assess its efficacy on other target insects of agricultural and public health importance. Besides, its safety towards other beneficial organisms still needs to be elucidated in real-world conditions, to ascertain the eco-friendliness of this natural product and its potential as ingredient in botanical insecticides. Its scalability on an industrial level may be assured by the huge biomass of boldo folium, which is exported all around the world and used to make pharmaceutics and herbal remedies.</p>
