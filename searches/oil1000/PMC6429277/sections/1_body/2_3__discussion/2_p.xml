<p class="p">Ascaridole is a bicyclic monoterpene endowed with a 1,4-endoperoxide ring formed from Î±-terpinene [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The most abundant form occurring in nature is the 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-isomer, which, under thermal rearrangement, is converted into the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-isomer [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The identification of the 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> form in our study was carried out by NMR analysis after purification by column chromatography (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00879-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The study of NMR spectra showing only the 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> form suggests that the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> form is an artifact produced during the GC run. This conversion can occur during vaporization in the GC instrument injection liner, or during the thermal ramp in the chromatographic separation. The biological activity of ascaridole is linked to the breakdown of the peroxide group leading to the formation of radicals which are toxic to several parasites (e.g.,
