<p class="p">Regarding the possible mode of action, our experiments conducted on the target AChE testing BEO indicated only a negligible activity (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 450 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). This was very low when compared with that exhibited by 
 <italic class="italic">D. ambrosioides</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 77 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum compactum</italic> Benth. (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 124 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] essential oils, but higher than that of 
 <italic class="italic">Crithmum maritimum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &gt; 3500 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Cannabis sativa</italic> L. (IC

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] essential oils. These findings suggest alternative ways through which BEO exert toxicity in the targeted insects. As an example, monoterpenoids occurring in BEO (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, limonene, phellandrene, 1,8-cineole) may be inhibitors of GABA-gated chloride channels in insects [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] and/or bind to octopamine receptors that are involved in important physiological functions of insects [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Besides, as reported above, ascaridole may induce oxidative stress in insects through the production of toxic radicals [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Thus, this interesting line of research is expected to be pursued in the years to come in order to better understand the potentiality of plant-borne essential oils.
