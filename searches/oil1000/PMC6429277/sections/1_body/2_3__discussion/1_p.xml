<p class="p">The hallmark of the BEO analyzed in this study was a lower amount of ascaridole (9.1%) compared to those reported in earlier studies by Petigny et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], Herrera-Rodriguez et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], Blázquez and Carbó [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], namely 46.9, 24.4, 38.9 and 31.4%, respectively. On the other hand, in the research by Passone and Etcheverry [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] ascaridole was not detected at all (
