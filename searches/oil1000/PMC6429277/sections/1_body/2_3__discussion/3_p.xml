<p class="p">In our experiments, the insecticidal activity exhibited by BEO may be linked to the bioactivity of its major components, with special reference to 1,8-cineole, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, limonene and ascaridole. Ascaridole is also a chemical marker of the essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Dysphanya ambrosioides</italic> (L.) Mosyakin &amp; Clemants and 
 <italic class="italic">Ledum palustre</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], which displayed notable toxicity on the same insect species. Notably, the oil from 
 <italic class="italic">D. ambrosioides</italic>, containing higher levels of ascaridole (61.4%), showed LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 62.1 ppm on 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus,</italic> which was similar to that of BEO (67.9 mg·L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). On the other hand, it was more toxic to adults of 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 51.7 μg·adult
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) when compared to BEO (98.5 μg·adult
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). We assume that the higher concentration of ascaridole, along with the lower amount of the insecticidal 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and the presence of other minor components, might explain the bioactivity differences detected between these two oils. Besides, the ascaridole-poor BEO tested here, can induce higher toxicity on the third instar larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> when compared with that analyzed by de Castro et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00879" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] (containing 31.4% ascaridole), who obtained an LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 82 ppm on the above-mentioned mosquito species. The same authors found an increase in toxicity in the ascaridole-enriched fraction (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 41.9 ppm). They correlated the toxicity of this ascaridole-rich essential oil to its capacity to induce midgut damages in the larvae [
