 <p class="p">Every year Chile exports about 2000 tons of boldo folium (
  <italic class="italic">Peumus boldus</italic>), which is used around the world as a traditional herbal medicinal product (THMP), mostly to relieve gastrointestinal disorders. This biomass may be a resource for the agrochemical industry to manufacture botanical insecticides. In this regard, the insecticidal potential of boldo has been poorly investigated. In the present work, hydrodistillation of a commercial boldo folium gave 1.5% (
  <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
  <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of a yellowish essential oil (boldo essential oil, BEO) containing 1,8-cineole (20.7%), 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (18.5%), limonene (9.1%), ascaridole (9.1%) and β-phellandrene (6.4%) as the main constituents, as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). NMR analysis allowed us to determine that ascaridole was mainly represented by the 
  <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-isomer. BEO was toxic to larvae of the filariasis vector 
  <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and adults of the housefly 
  <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic>, showing LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>/LD
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 67.9 mg
  <italic class="italic">·</italic>L
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 98.5 µg
  <italic class="italic">·</italic>adult
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. On the other hand, lower insecticidal activity was observed against larvae of the moth pest 
  <italic class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (LD
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 268.9 µg
  <italic class="italic">·</italic>larva
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). It is worth noting that, when tested at LC
  <sub class="sub">90</sub> concentration, BEO was significantly less toxic to aquatic microcrustacean 
  <italic class="italic">Daphnia magna</italic> than the conventional insecticide α-cypermethrin. Finally, in the attempt to explore the BEO mode of action, we tested it for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory properties using the Ellman method, obtaining negligible effects (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.45 mg·mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Taken together, these results gave new insights into the potential of BEO as a future ingredient of botanical insecticides.
