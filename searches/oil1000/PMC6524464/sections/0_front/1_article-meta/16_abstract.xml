 <p class="p">Frankincense, the oleo-gum-resin of 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia</italic> trees, has been an important religious and medicinal element for thousands of years, and today is used extensively for essential oils. One of the most popular frankincense species is 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia sacra</italic> Flueck. (syn. 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic> Birdw.) from Somalia and Somaliland. Recent increases in demand have led to many areas being overharvested, emphasizing the need for incentives and monitoring for sustainable harvesting, such as certification schemes. Concurrently, a new chemical component, called methoxydecane, has emerged in oils claimed to be 
  <italic class="italic">B. carteri</italic>, suggesting the possibility of a chemical marker of overharvesting or other stress that could aid in monitoring. To find the source of this new chemical component, we sampled resin directly from trees in areas producing the new methoxydecane chemotype. This revealed that methoxydecane comes not from 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic>, but from a newly described frankincense species, 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia occulta</italic>. The presence of 
  <italic class="italic">Boswellia occulta</italic> oil in essential oil sold as pure 
  <italic class="italic">B. carteri</italic>, including certified organic oil, emphasizes the current lack of traceability in the supply chain and the ineffectiveness of organic certification to secure purity and sustainable harvesting in wildcrafted species.
