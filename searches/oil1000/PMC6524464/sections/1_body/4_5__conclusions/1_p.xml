<p class="p">Methoxydecane in frankincense essential oil comes from a new species, 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia occulta</italic> Thulin, DeCarlo &amp; S. P. Johnson, rather than being a chemotype of 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic>, as previously thought. The new species is highly morphologically distinct from 
 <italic class="italic">B. carteri</italic>, and likely evaded detection until now due to a lack of traceability and source verification in most frankincense supply chains. Methoxydecane has been detected in many commercial essential oils being sold as pure 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic>, including in certified organic essential oils, indicating both the need for improved supply chain transparency and the ineffectiveness of organic certification in ensuring purity and sustainable harvesting in these wild-harvested species.
