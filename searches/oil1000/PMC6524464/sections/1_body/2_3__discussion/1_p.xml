<p class="p">The purpose of this study was to identify the reason for the emergence of a new chemical component, methoxydecane, in essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic> coming from Somaliland. Our results show that the presence of methoxydecane is not due to either climatic or anthropogenic stress, as previously hypothesized, but rather to the mixing of resin from two different species, 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia occulta</italic>. Although it is possible that both species produce this chemotype, it is unlikely given that methoxyalkanes are extremely rare as natural products, only being reported in a handful of arthropods, possibly microbes, and never, to our knowledge, in plants [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-08-00088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Furthermore, methoxyalkanes have never appeared in resin samples from confirmed 
 <italic class="italic">B. carteri</italic> trees [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-08-00088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Therefore, we conclude that methoxyalkanes, and especially methoxydecane, are the hallmark of 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic> rather than of overharvested trees.
