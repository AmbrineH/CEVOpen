<p class="p">In this study, four out of five of the essential oils claiming to be certified organic 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic> tested positive for the presence of methoxydecane, containing on average even more methoxydecane than the conventional oils. This indicates that organic certification, while useful in preventing artificial chemical contamination, is not sufficient to guarantee purity in wild-harvested products. There are several reasons why this contamination is possible even in certified resins. Certifiers may not have sufficient knowledge to accurately identify the species they are supposed to certify, or they may only visit a small subset of the total area that they certify. Alternatively, resins coming from non-certified areas may be passed off as certified material. Regardless of the reasons, the pervasiveness of methoxydecane in commercial essential oils being sold as pure 
 <italic class="italic">B. carteri</italic> essential oil demonstrates the ineffectiveness of organic certification alone at preventing biological contamination. As a corollary, this also indicates that organic certification is unlikely to ensure sustainable harvesting practices, as the certification apparently is not able to accurately identify source trees. Therefore, sustainability efforts should concentrate on robust traceability and verification frameworks and incentives for sustainable harvesting rather than only organic certification.
