<p class="p">Despite the obvious morphological differences, Somali harvesters have considered 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia occulta</italic> to be the same species, referring to them both as “Mohor,” while drawing a distinction between these two species and another commonly harvested frankincense, 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia frereana</italic> (“Yegcar”). The harvesters do distinguish multiple types of 
 <italic class="italic">B. carteri,</italic> based on growth form, resin characteristics, and substrate (Mohor cad, Mohor lab, Mohor dadbeed; 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic> is called Mohor madow), but they refer to the resin of both 
 <italic class="italic">B. carteri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. occulta</italic> as “beeyo,” while the resin of 
 <italic class="italic">B. frereana</italic> is called “maydi” ([

This may help explain why it was not previously identified; still, its anonymity until now, despite its prevalence in frankincense essential oils, indicates that companies selling the resin or essential oil likely have limited knowledge of the source trees of these resins.
