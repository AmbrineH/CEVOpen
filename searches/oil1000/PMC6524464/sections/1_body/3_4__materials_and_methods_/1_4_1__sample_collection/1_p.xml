<p class="p">Areas producing methoxydecane resins were identified by a major resin exporter in Somaliland and confirmed via commercial samples from each area; specific villages were identified by local harvesters. Samples of oleo-gum-resin were collected (Marchâ€“July 2018) by our field team directly from 12 individual trees being tapped by local harvesters and identified by these harvesters as 
 <italic class="italic">Boswellia carteri</italic>. The resins were sealed in plastic bags and shipped to The Aromatic Plant Research Center in Utah, USA, for analysis. Additionally, the team took photographs of each tree (canopy, leaves, and bark), as well as a voucher specimen which was deposited into the University of Hargeisa Herbarium (HARG No. 000189).
