<p class="p">The reasons for the unusual chemotype and only recent appearance have not been established, but one hypothesis is that it is a chemical response to prolonged overharvesting, representing a chemical marker of overharvested trees. Other explanations include that rising demand and local prices for resin have motivated tapping of previously undisturbed areas, or that it is produced by 
 <italic class="italic">B. carteri</italic> trees during drought. A key implication of all of these hypotheses is that the frankincense trees in Somaliland are experiencing heightened stress, either from intensifying/expanding resin harvesting or from significant environmental stress. Both certification of harvested trees and chemical stress markers may therefore be important tools to encourage sustainable harvesting and protection of harvested trees. In this paper, we aim to identify the source trees producing the methoxydecane chemotype, in order to better understand its cause and the implications of its emergence for sustainable forest management.
