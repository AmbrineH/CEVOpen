A number of certification standards, most notably FairWild, are specifically designed for the harvesting of wild plants, and have been implemented successfully elsewhere; however, they are data-intensive, requiring information such as population inventories and landscape assessments that can be difficult to gather in Somaliland. Organic certification offers a less intensive option that also demands greater traceability and provides economic benefits; at least four companies are certified to produce organic resins in Somaliland/Somalia to United States Department of Agriculture National Organic Program (USDA NOP) standards [
