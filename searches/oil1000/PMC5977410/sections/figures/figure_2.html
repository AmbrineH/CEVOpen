 <p> (A) NiO NPs induced cytotoxicity in A549 cells. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of NiO NPs for 24 h. (B) Effects of PLEO on cell viability. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oil samples for 24 h also. Triton was used as a negative control. Data represented are mean ± SD of three independent experiments. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001 treatments compared to control. </p>
