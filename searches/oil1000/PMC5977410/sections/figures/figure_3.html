 <p> Protective effect of PLEO on NiO NPs induced cytotoxicity. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of essential oil for 24 h followed by NiO NPs for 24 h. Triton was used as a negative control. Data represented are mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *** p &lt; 0.001 treatments compared to control; ≠ p &lt; 0.05; # p &lt; 0.01; ## p &lt; 0.001 compared to NiO NPs. </p>
