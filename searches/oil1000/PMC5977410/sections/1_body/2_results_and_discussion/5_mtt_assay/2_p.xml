<p id="par0160" class="p">MTT assay was undertaken in order to evaluate the effectiveness of PLEO extracted on cell viability in A549 cells stressed by NiO NPs. First we evaluated the effects of NiO NPs on A549 cells viability. Incubation with 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μg/ml for 24 h resulted in a concentration dependent decrease in cell viability, the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was 79.83 ± 0.856 μg/ml (
