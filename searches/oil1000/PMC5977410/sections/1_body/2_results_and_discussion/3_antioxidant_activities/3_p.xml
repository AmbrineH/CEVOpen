<p id="par0145" class="p">According to the results which have been obtained, the tested samples were able to reduce the DPPH radical and scavenging the Superoxide radical with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> equal to 640 ± 0.16 μg/ml and 760 ± 0.125 μg/ml for DPPH and SOD assay respectively. Different parts and constituents from

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[38]</xref>]. Using the DPPH scavenging activity assay, it was found that all of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. lentiscus</italic> extracts in solvents, except for the chloroform extract, have a high radical scavenging activity (90%) equivalent to that of the standard, BHA (89%). The ethanolic and aqueous fractions from the ethyl acetate extract have high scavenging activities with values of 78 ± 0.93% and 90.29 ± 0.29%, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In 2007, Barra et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] conducted a study which showed that the PLEO exhibited radical scavenging activity ranged between 0.52 and 4.61 mmol/l.
