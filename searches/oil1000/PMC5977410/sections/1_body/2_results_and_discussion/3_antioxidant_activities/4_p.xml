<p id="par0150" class="p">The highest reducing power ability (μg GAE equivalent/g) and scavenging ability on ABTS radicals (μmol Trolox equivalent/mg) were observed also in the following order; ascorbic acid &gt; BHT &gt; PLEO. From our data, it appears that the values in the present study were comparable to those of Ascorbic acid and BHT. While comparing our present results of this assay with the literature already published, we found very few reports on the antioxidant activity of PLEO. We are the first evaluated the reducing power, ABTS and Superoxide radicals scavenging ability of PLEO.</p>
