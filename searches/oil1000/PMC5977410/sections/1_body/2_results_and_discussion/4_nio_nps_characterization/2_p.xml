 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>A shows a sharp diffraction peaks that clearly indicates the crystalline nature of NiO NPs. No peaks of impurity were found in the XRD pattern, indicating that the nanoparticles of NiO used in this study consists of ultrapure phase. The existence of strong and sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.41, 43.35, 62.95, 75.40 and 79.45 which perfectly corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) crystal planes, respectively (JCPDS Card No. 73-1523). Besides, the crystallite size has been estimated from XRD using the Scherer’s equation [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The average nanocrystallite size of NiO NPs corresponding to the highest peak observed in XRD was found to be 24 nm. The typical TEM image of NiO NPs is indicated in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>B and C. TEM analyze show that the average diameter, from measuring over 70 particles, of NiO NPs was around 25 nm (further supporting the XRD results) and they have the tendency to aggregate in the solution used. 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>D represents frequency of size distribution of NiO NPs. The measurements, performed by DLS, determined the average hydrodynamic size (293.86 ± 9.51 and 288.1 ± 7.04 nm) and the zeta potential (−14.06 ± 0.60 and −18.2 ± 1.10 mV) of NiO NPs in water and culture media, respectively.
