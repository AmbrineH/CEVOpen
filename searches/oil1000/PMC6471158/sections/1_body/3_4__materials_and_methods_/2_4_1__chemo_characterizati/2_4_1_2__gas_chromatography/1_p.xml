<p class="p">Analyses were carried out on an Agilent Technologies 7820 gas chromatograph (Waldbronn, DE) with a flame ionization detector (FID). Compounds were separated by means of Agilent Technologies HP-5 crosslinked poly-5% diphenyl-95% dimethyl polysiloxane (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) capillary column. The temperature program was the same as described above. The injection volume was 0.1 µL in split mode 1:20. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injector and detector temperature was set at 250 °C, 280 °C, and 230 °C, respectively. EOs and the reference standards were diluted 1:20 (
