<p class="p">Aliquots of 500 μL from the above-mentioned samples were centrifuged at 800× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min, and the pellet fixed in 500 μL of 5% glutaraldehyde solution buffered at pH 7.2 with phosphate buffer 0.1 M. The samples were resuspended and a drop of each was pipetted on a stapled filter paper bag and washed with phosphate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.2. Dehydration was performed by means of increasing concentrations of aqueous ethanol (10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 75%, and 95%) for 15 min and in 100% ethanol for 5 min at 5 °C. Specimens were then dried with a critical point drier unit K850 (Emitech Ltd., Ashford, UK), mounted on aluminum stubs with double stick tape and coated with a gold–palladium film using an ion sputtering unit K500 (Emitech Ltd., Ashford, UK). The dry samples were then observed with a 515 SEM (Philips, Eindhoven, NL) at 10 kV, and the pictures were taken with a 5400 Coolpix digital camera (Nikon, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan).
