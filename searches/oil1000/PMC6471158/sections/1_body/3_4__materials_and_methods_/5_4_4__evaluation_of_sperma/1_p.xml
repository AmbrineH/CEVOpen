<p class="p">Viability (V) was assessed using Eosin-Nigrosin staining [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], while the percentage of reacted acrosomes (AR) was calculated by means of a modified Coomassie Blue staining protocol [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The objective analysis of motility, including total (TotM) and progressive (ProgM) motility, was performed by a CASA unit (Hamilton Thorne CEROS II, Animal Motility II, Software version 1.9, Beverly, MA, USA) with a heated stage, after 5 min of incubation of the samples at 37 °C. Since the kinematics parameters can only be appreciated on motile spermatozoa, only samples with TotM ≥20% were used for their analysis as previously done [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Analyzed parameters included: average path velocity (VAP), curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight line velocity (VSL), distance of the average path (DAP), curvilinear distance (DCL), straight line distance (DSL), linearity (LIN, calculated from VSL/VCL), straightness (STR; calculated from VSL/VAP), wobble (WOB; calculated from VAP/VCL), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and beat cross frequency (BCF) [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The pH of each sample was analyzed using a Medidor PH BASIC 20 (Hach Large srl, Milan, Italy) after calibration according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
