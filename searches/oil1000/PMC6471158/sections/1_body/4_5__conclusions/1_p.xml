<p class="p">In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of evaluating the effects of natural compounds on spermatozoa before suggesting and exploiting their beneficial effects in the reproductive field. As already reported, the analytical approach seems to provide robust and repeatable results that may also help to unveil the mechanism of interactions of such compounds. Motility proved to be the most sensitive parameter for the analysis of tea tree oil, strengthening the idea of future applications of spermatozoa in toxicological screenings, in the light of their mitochondria abundance and their capability to generate movement. The concentrations of TTO and TER that resulted as non-toxic on the basis of this study need further investigations for potential exploitation in the reproductive field.</p>
