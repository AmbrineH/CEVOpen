<p class="p">The need for new and improved protocols for preservation of swine artificial insemination (AI) doses has led researchers toward the study of new active compounds with antibiotic and antioxidant potential [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Indeed, up to date, only 1% of porcine AIs around the world are conducted with frozen-thawed semen [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] because of the cellular damage that leads to low fertility in this species [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. During cryopreservation protocols, antioxidants are necessary to improve cryotolerance [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], but synthetic ones do not always perform well in boars thus, lately, plant based ones have begun to be taken into account [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Despite the efforts, liquid phase preservation (16 ± 1 °C) of boar AI doses is still the most common storage technique [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In this case, antibiotics are essential to limit bacterial growth [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], as this determines alterations to the midpiece, acrosome, and plasma membrane of the spermatozoa leading to worse quality parameters [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Moreover, the European Union (Council Directive 90/429/EEC) [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] dictates the use of antibiotics in swine seminal AI doses as mandatory to prevent the spreading of diseases. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that antibiotics added to seminal doses may be potentially dangerous for both animal and human health as they can contribute to the phenomenon of antibiotic-resistance in the swine industry [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The scenario prospected by the EU regarding the risks of multi-resistant bacteria calls for ethical discussion regarding how actually necessary are antibiotics and what alternatives can be proposed especially in the zoo-technical world. All of the above leads, again, to the need for new molecules and substances with antioxidant and/or antibacterial capabilities.
