<p class="p">For both tested substances, progressive motility follows the trend of total motility despite some “earlier” significant differences. Indeed, ProgM, is significantly altered already at “lower” concentrations. Nonetheless, from a biological point of view, these slight discrepancies between TotM and ProgM are only relatively important, as the actual number of progressive motile spermatozoa is directly related to the overall motile ones (ProgM is a small population of TotM). </p>
