<p class="p">Several studies have already reported how terpinen-4-ol by itself still shows antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], a feature that could be highly exploitable, for example, in swine AI. Nonetheless, the MICs (Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations) reported by literature against different bacteria are highly variable going from 0.6 up to 2.5 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], thus potentially toxic on the basis of the present study. The same statement seems to be true also for TTO, since the MICs available in the literature vary from very low concentrations (0.12â€“0.5 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]) up to extremely high ones (20 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Nonetheless, due to the singular nature of each batch of each essential oil, influenced by a wide variety of agricultural and industrial factors, the analysis of antibacterial capabilities through MICs can be very challenging. It is still important to acknowledge that synergistic effects of lower doses of different molecules, partially already confirmed [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], have to be explored and how recent studies have reported that sub-lethal doses of essential oils and natural compounds may still be effective in controlling bacteria by alteration of peculiar virulence factors [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-01071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In such a scenario, if the aim is to exploit TTO and/or TER as antimicrobial agents in AI doses, further studies have to be performed to confirm such a possibility.
