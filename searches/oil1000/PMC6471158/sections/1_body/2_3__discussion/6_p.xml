<p class="p">The results regarding toxicity upon membrane damage are also important since EOs, whether used as potential antimicrobial or spermicidal agents from an industrial point of view, should also be tested for their effect on the female reproductive apparatus. This context is even more delicate and complex to analyze as in vitro testing would not be sufficient. Indeed, the effects exerted by EOs on isolated cell will most likely change in in vivo conditions, where physiological defense mechanisms, such as mucus, are available. </p>
