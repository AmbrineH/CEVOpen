<p class="p">The results of the present study suggest that the toxic effects of the used EO are either to be imputed to other constituents rather than terpinen-4-ol or to the synergic interaction of all the components of the oil itself. This point is extremely critical when it comes to the application of phytocompounds and the study of their mechanism of action as the difference in chemotype may alter the outcome of the hypothesized synergistic capabilities of the single components.</p>
