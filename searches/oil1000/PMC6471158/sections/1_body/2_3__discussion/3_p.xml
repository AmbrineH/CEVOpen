<p class="p">Overall, TTO seems to be well tolerated by porcine spermatozoa up to a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL; higher quantities of this EO determined increasing impairment in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by the results of the linear regression models for all test parameters excluding pH. Such a pattern of concentration-dependent effects is in agreement with what has already been reported for two other essential oils (

On the other hand, membrane integrity seems to be less sensitive to the action of the EO as shown by the results of viability and acrosome status, and ichnographically confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. These findings may suggest an early functional impairment, probably due to interactions with the mitochondrial capability of producing motion [

This scenario strengthens the necessity to test the toxic effects of exogenous compounds directly in spermatozoa, when the aim is to use them in the reproductive field, as motility impairment cannot be assessed on other cells.
