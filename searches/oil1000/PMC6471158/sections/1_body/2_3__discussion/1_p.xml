<p class="p">The present study aimed at the evaluation and comparison of the effects of tea tree oil and its main constituent, terpinen-4-ol, on porcine spermatozoa, using the main sperm morpho-functional parameters as study variables. Nowadays, it is common opinion that natural substances, like EOs and or phytoextracts can represent an improvement of the standard cryopreservation protocols of swine AI, but their deleterious potential has to be taken into account and investigated in depth. Indeed, the antibacterial effects of essential oils have to be imputed to a mechanism of interaction with membranes, as highly lipophilic, that may not be selective towards bacteria, as opposed to common antibiotics [

This is why the characterization of the direct effects of each essential oil on the spermatic cell is necessary before considering their applications in the reproductive field. Moreover, the peculiar physiology of the spermatozoa, capable of generating motion, makes it a potentially useful tool for the in vitro characterization of general toxicity of exogenous compounds [
