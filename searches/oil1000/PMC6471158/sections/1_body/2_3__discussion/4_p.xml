<p class="p">The rationale for testing terpinen-4-ol by itself was driven by its strong presence in the used EO, accountable for the 41.49% of its whole composition. Indeed, the used concentrations of terpinen-4-ol were calculated on the ones chosen for the EO in order to be able to compare the results between the two groups. Overall, this molecule was better tolerated, as the first toxic effects started to appear at 0.67 mg/mL, the third highest tested concentration. The damage pattern seems opposite to the one determined by TTO, as the most sensitive parameters were, in this case, viability and acrosome reaction. Motility indeed was only significantly altered at the highest concentration, despite a decreasing trend starting from 0.67 mg/mL. Overall, all the tested parameters were less altered upon co-incubation with the single compound, as confirmed by SEM images, in contrast to that described by Hammer et al. [
