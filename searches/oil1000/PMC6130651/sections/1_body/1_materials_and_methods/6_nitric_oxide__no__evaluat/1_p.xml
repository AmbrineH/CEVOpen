<p class="p">NO production by infected peritoneal cells was evaluated in the aforementioned cultures according to Costa et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Briefly, supernatants (100 µL) were collected 24 h after treatment and incubated with an equal volume of Griess Reagent (1% sulfanilamide/0.1% (Naphthyl) ethylenediamine in 5% phosphoric acid) at room temperature for 10 min. The accumulation of nitrite (NO
