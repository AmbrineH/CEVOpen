<p class="p">The oils were prepared in dichloromethane at the concentration of 1 mg/mL, then subjected to a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Shimadzu model QP2010 plus with an auto-injector AOC-20i and an RTX-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ×0:25 μm). Nitrogen was applied as carrier gas (flow rate of 1.13 mL/min), with the following temperature program: 75 °C for 6 min, 170 °C for 5 min; and 260 °C for 15 min. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C, and the mass spectra were obtained by electron impact at 70 eV. Constituents were confirmed by comparison with libraries (NIST and WILEY) and calculation of the Kovats index, accepting variations under 30.</p>
