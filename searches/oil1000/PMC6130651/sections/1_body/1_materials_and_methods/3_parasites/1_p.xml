 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> (MHOM/BR/1972/BH46) and 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> (IFLA/BR/1967/PH8) were used for 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antileishmania assays. Amastigote forms were routinely isolated from infected Golden hamsters (
 <italic class="italic">Mesocricetus auratus</italic>) and maintained as promastigotes in Schneider’s Insect Medium (Sigma-Aldrich
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>) supplemented with 20% foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>) and 140 μg/mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>) at 26 °C. On the seventh day of cultivation, promastigote forms from up to four serial passages after isolation were used in the experiments.
