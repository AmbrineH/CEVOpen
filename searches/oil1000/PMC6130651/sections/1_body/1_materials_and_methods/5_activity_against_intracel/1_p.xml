<p class="p">Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from BALB/c mice and placed in a 24-well plate (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 140 μg/mL gentamicin, Sigma-Aldrich) as described by Bosquiroli et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Cells were infected with 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/well) and incubated at 35 °C/5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> overnight. The oils were added at concentrations of 6.25 to 50 μg/mL in sets of sextuplicate experiments, and cells were incubated at 35 °C/5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for 24 h. Untreated infected cells and amphotericin B (Amphotericin B solution, 250 μg/mL, Sigma) were used as a negative and positive control, respectively. Percentage of infected macrophages and a total number of amastigotes were determined by counting 200 cells sixfold. The infection index was determined by multiplying the percentage of macrophages that had at least one intracellular parasite by the mean number of amastigotes per macrophage, according to Paladi et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated by nonlinear dose-response regression curve (GraphPad Prism 5.0
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> software). Results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and the data were analyzed using the Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test. Differences were considered significant at
