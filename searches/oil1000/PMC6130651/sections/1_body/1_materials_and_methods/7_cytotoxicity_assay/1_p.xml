<p class="p">Murine macrophage (J774.A1) and fibroblast (NIH/3T3) cells purchased from the Rio de Janeiro Cell Bank (Brazil) were treated with the essential oils (0.25–250 μg/mL) in triplicate to estimate IC
 <sub class="sub">50.</sub> Oils were dissolved in DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin B. The highest concentration of DMSO was 0.25%, and did not affect cell viability. Amphotericin B (0.025 to 25 μg/mL) and cells in culture medium were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. Cell viability was determined using the sulforhodamine B assay (Skehan et al.
