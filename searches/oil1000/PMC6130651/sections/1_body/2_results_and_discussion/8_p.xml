 <italic class="italic">Nectandra amazonum</italic> essential oil (NAEO) showed moderate activity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> with a low selectivity index (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), evincing a relevant cytotoxicity. NAEO was composed of 90.1% sesquiterpenes, with a major presence of β-caryophyllene (28.5%). This compound was previously demonstrated to be active against 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> by Carmo et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) after isolation from 
 <italic class="italic">Piper duckei</italic> C.DC. β-Caryophyllene was even more active than the entire essential oil, which contained 27.1% of this compound. Soares et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) have also demonstrated the anti-
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> activity of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-β-caryophyllene isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Copaifera</italic> spp. commercial oil. On the other hand, Hadri et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) showed the cytotoxic effect of β-caryophyllene on HCT-116, MCF-7, and murine macrophage RAW264.7 cancer cell lines, thus, likely contributing to the cytotoxic effect found for NAEO in our work. This cytotoxic effect can be reinforced by the fact that NAEO was able to induce a significant increase in NO production by peritoneal cells infected by 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> (
