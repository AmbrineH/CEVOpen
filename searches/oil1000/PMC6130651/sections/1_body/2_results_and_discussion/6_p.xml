<p class="p">Essential oils from the two specimens of 
 <italic class="italic">N. megapotamica</italic> (NMEO1 and NMEO2) had no cytotoxic effect on the mammalian cells tested (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The phytochemical profile of NMEO1 and NMEO2 varied considerably (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), reflecting possible differences in the collection sites. Indeed, plants collected in different areas may belong to genotypically diverse populations, with consequent differences in the chemical composition (Garcez et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), once the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is highly affected by the environmental conditions (Kutchan 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). The oil from the first specimen (NMEO1), which was collected in a humid zone near a stream, did not show relevant antileishmania activity on 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> (&gt; 50.0 ± 1.3 µg/mL), with a moderate activity on 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The chemical analysis identified two phenylpropanoids (61.4%) as the major compounds, elemicin (41.7%) and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-asarone (19.7%). NMEO1 also includes sesquiterpenes (19.1%) and monoterpenes (13.9%) (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). On the other hand, the oil from the second specimen (NMEO2), which was collected in an urbanized dried area, was composed mainly of sesquiterpenes (49.9%), with an absence of monoterpenes (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The higher concentration of sesquiterpenes may have reflected a water stress condition to which the plant was submitted, and contributed to improving the activity against 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> intracellular amastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 12.5 ± 1.4 µg/mL, 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, Yadav et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) demonstrated an increase of sesquiterpenes in the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia annua</italic> L. submitted to a prolonged effect of water stress. Interestingly, the phenylpropanoid 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>-asarone was the major compound of NMEO2 (42.4%) and possibly influenced the antileishmania activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an association.
