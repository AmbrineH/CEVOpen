<p class="p">NO release by infected macrophages was investigated after treatment with essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic> spp. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The increase in NO release by 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic>-infected cells after treatment with NHEO did not achieve statistical significance at most of the concentrations tested, showing that this oil probably does not act by this indirect mechanism to control 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> infection. Instead, this oil might act directly on the parasites. On the other hand, NHEO induced a significant increase in NO production by 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic>-infected cells, compared to infected control cells. Interestingly, Siqueira etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) demonstrated that the bicyclogermacrene-rich oil from 
 <italic class="italic">A. coriacea</italic> had a direct action on 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> promastigote forms, what could help elucidate its mechanism of action.
