<p class="p">The oil from 
 <italic class="italic">N. hihua</italic> (NHEO) was the most active on 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> intracellular amastigotes (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.2 ± 1.1 µg/mL), being more potent than the reference drug amphotericin B (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The selectivity index (SI) values were 249.4 and 149.0 for fibroblasts and murine macrophages, respectively, reflecting its highly selective action on amastigote forms. NHEO was composed mainly by sesquiterpenes (89%), with a major presence of bicyclogermacrene (28.1%) (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This compound has been previously associated with the antileishmania activity described for the volatile oils from

 <italic class="italic">A. foetida</italic> Mart. (Costa et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The second main compound in NHEO was germacrene D (13.8%). Machado et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) found this sesquiterpene to be the most representative compound of

 <italic class="italic">L. amazonensis</italic> (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 24.2 ± 1.2 µg/mL), what suggests different susceptibilities of these two species.
