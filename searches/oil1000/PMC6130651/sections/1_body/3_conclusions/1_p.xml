<p class="p">To our knowledge, this work is the first investigation of the antileishmania activity of the essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic> spp. The oils from 
 <italic class="italic">N. gardneri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N. hihua</italic> showed potential activity and low cytotoxicity on mammalian cells, becoming promising sources of compounds for the development of new antileishmania drugs. Chemical profiles showed a considerable presence of sesquiterpenes, whose isolation is being carried out in order to perform the antileishmania tests. Except for 
 <italic class="italic">N. gardneri</italic>, the oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Nectandra</italic> seemingly do not stimulate NO production. We propose that future studies should test the direct application of these oils on parasites.
