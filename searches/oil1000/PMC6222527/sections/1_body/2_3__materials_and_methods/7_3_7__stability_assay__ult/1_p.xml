<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> essential oil degradation assay was conducted in an ultraviolet chamber (BOITTON) coupled to a light containing two special lamps simulating radiation in the UV-A and UV-B spectrum with wavelengths of 365 and 254 nm, respectively. The system was kept at room temperature (25.0 ± 2.0 °C). A total of 1 mL of each essential oil sample (EO or NSEO) was transferred to clear vials and kept under UV radiation for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 h. At each time interval, a 250-μL aliquot of each sample, in triplicate, was diluted in 1.5 mL (for NSEO) or 2.5 mL (for EO) of hexane for analysis. The mixtures were subsequently vortexed to obtain a liquid-liquid fraction, with the hexane and essential oil phase being analyzed by UV/VIS spectrophotometry using the method described at item 3.3.
