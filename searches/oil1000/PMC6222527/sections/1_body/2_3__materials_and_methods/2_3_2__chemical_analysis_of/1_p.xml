<p class="p">The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit was analyzed via a gas chromatographer coupled to a sequential mass spectrometer (MSTQ8030 Shimadzu, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) (GC-MS/MS), equipped with an auto-injector (Combi PAL AOC-5000, CTC Analytics, Aargau, Switzerland), Restek Rtx-5ms (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) silica-fused column (30 m × 0.250 mm × 0.25 μm), and electronic impact ionization detector (70 eV) ( Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The separation data and their treatment were performed using the software CGMS Real-Time Analysis
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>. The initial temperature was set to 60 °C, followed by ramping along two temperature gradients, 3 °C/min until 200 °C and 15 °C/min until 280 °C, where the temperature remained for 1 min. The parameters used were 230 °C injector temperature, 300 °C detector temperature, 57.4 kPa injection pressure, 1:50 splitless ratio, and 43–550

Quantitative analysis was performed using a gas chromatographer equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) (GC-2010 Shimadzu, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), under the same conditions as for GC-MS. The essential oil components were identified by comparison against the NIST database and the literature based on the retention indices (RI), which were determined relative to a series of
