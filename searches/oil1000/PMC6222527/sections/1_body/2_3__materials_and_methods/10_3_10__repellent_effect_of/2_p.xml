<p class="p">In the free-choice test, pots containing one seedling each were equidistantly placed in four cages (100 cm length × 45 cm width × 45 cm height) wrapped in voile. Each cage contained one replication of each treatment. A total of 350 adult whiteflies were released into each cage, where they remained for 24 h for oviposition. After this period, the leaves and insects were removed. Subsequently, the evaluation began with the number of eggs in a delineated area (4 cm in diameter) in the central region of the abaxial face of the leaf being counted with the aid of a stereoscopic microscope at 40× magnification.</p>
