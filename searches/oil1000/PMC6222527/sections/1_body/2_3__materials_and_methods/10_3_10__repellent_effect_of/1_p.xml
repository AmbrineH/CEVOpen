<p class="p">Two repellency tests were performed—(1) free-choice and (2) no-choice—using the same treatments described previously in the section “Bioassays with 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic> nymphs and adults”. In the free-choice test, all treated plants were placed together in the same cage and the females could choose the plant to oviposit. In the no-choice test, plants were kept individually in each cage. In both tests, seeds of the common bean cultivar Pérola (
 <italic class="italic">P. vulgaris</italic>) were sown in 400 mL of soil (eutrophic red latosol) in polyethylene pots (415 mL volume). After 7 days, only one seedling per pot was retained; each primary leaf was sprayed with 300 μL of each treatment on both leaf faces using a Paasche H-series airbrush connected to a vacuum pump. Four replicates per treatment were used, with three plants per replicate containing two primary leaves each, in a completely randomized experimental design.
