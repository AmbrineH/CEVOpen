<p class="p">The deterrence test was evaluated by calculating the stimulant/deterrent oviposition index from the equation proposed by Fenemore [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], [(A − B)/(A + B)] × 100, where A = the number of eggs in the treatment to be tested, and B = the number of eggs in the control treatment. The index ranged from +100 (total stimulation) to zero (neutral) to −100 (total deterrence).
