<p class="p">The effect of the EO and NSEO 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% were assessed on 2nd-instar nymphs, and on the repellency of adult whiteflies. As a positive control, the chemical insecticides cyantraniliprole (Benevia
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, DuPont Crop Protection, Axis, AL, USA) and Oberon
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (spiromesifen, Bayer AG, Dormagen, Germany) were used in the assays conducted on nymphs and in the repellency tests, respectively. Both were used at a concentration of 0.25% (500 mL/ha) per the manufacturer’s recommendations. For the negative controls, distilled water, empty nanosphere suspensions (the same formulations used in the preparation of the nanoencapsulates, without essential oil), and Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80 emulsions at a concentration of 0.3% were used. The latter were used in the emulsification of EO.
