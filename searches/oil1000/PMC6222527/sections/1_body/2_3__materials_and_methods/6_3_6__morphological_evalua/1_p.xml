<p class="p">The homogeneity of the colloidal suspensions and the shape of the nanoparticles obtained were analyzed at the Microscopy Center of the Federal University of Minas Gerais [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais-UFMG]. The colloidal suspension was deposited in 12-mm-diameter stubs, followed by silica drying. After total solvent evaporation, samples were metallized with 2 nm of Au/Pd metal alloy and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Quanta 200 FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). </p>
