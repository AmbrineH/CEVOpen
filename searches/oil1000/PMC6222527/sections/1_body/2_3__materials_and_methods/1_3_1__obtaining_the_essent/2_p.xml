<p class="p">The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit was obtained by hydrodistillation for a period of 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus coupled with a 3-L round bottom flask. The hydrolate was centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 rpm for phase separation. The organic (less dense) phase was removed using a glass Pasteur pipette. Anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) was added to the solution to remove excess water and was subsequently filtered. The obtained essential oil was transferred to an amber bottle and refrigerated. The yield (%) was determined by the ratio between the weight (g) of the oil obtained and the weight of fruit (g) used in the extraction.
