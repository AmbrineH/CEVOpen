<p class="p">Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of EO and NSEO 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit on the mortality of 2nd-instar nymphs. Five seeds of the common bean PÃ©rola cultivar (
 <italic class="italic">P. vulgaris</italic>) were sown in 1.5 L of soil (eutrophic red latosol) containing 2.8 g of NPK 5-30-15 fertilizer in polyethylene pots (1.5 L volume). After nine days, three seedlings, whose trefoils were sheared for primary leaf maintenance, were maintained per pot; the seedlings were subsequently infested with adult whiteflies. The whiteflies were kept on the bean stalks for 24 h for oviposition. After this period, the insects were removed using a handheld vacuum.
