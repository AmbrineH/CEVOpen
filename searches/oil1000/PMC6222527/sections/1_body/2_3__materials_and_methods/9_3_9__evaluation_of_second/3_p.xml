<p class="p">A stereomicroscope at 40× magnification was used to evaluate live and dead nymphs in a delineated area (4 cm in diameter) in the central region of the abaxial face of the leaf. Evaluations began three days after spraying and were performed on every other day for two weeks. For each day of evaluation, one leaf from each plant was removed, for a total of four leaves per treatment. The evaluation criteria for dead nymphs included features such as dark coloration and dehydrated and wilted appearance. Empty puparia were used to determine the survival of the 4th-instar nymphs. Four replicates per treatment were used, with three plants per replicate containing two primary leaves each, in a completely randomized experimental design. The experiment was repeated over time. During treatment application, the conditions in the first experiment were (a) mean temperature = 23.4935 ± 2.94 °C, (b) mean relative humidity = 86.6595 ± 9.627%, and (c) mean light intensity = 480.85 ± 422.63 lm/ft
