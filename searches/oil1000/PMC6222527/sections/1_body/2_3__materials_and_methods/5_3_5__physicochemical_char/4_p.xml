<p class="p">The pH values were determined immediately after preparing the colloidal suspensions, using a potentiometer (HANNA model FT-P21, Tecnal Scientific Equipment, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) previously calibrated with buffer solutions of pH 4.0 and pH 7.0. The ZP, PD, and PdI were determined using a Zetasizer Nano ZS apparatus (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, England.). For this purpose, samples were diluted in distilled water to a final concentration of 10% (
