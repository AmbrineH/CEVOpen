<p class="p">The encapsulation efficiency was determined using the filtration-centrifugation technique. The colloidal nanosphere suspensions (1.0 mL) were transferred to tubes containing 0.22-μm pore size cellulose acetate filters (Spin-X, Corning
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). The suspensions were subsequently centrifuged (Thoth 9300R, Thoth Equipment, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) for 40 min at 8000 rpm at 20 °C. After centrifugation, 250 μL of the ultrafiltrate was added to 2.5 mL of hexane for liquid-liquid extraction using a vortex apparatus. The hexane fraction was analyzed by UV/Vis spectroscopy (DR/5000 UV-Vis HACH, Hach Company, Loveland, CO, USA).
