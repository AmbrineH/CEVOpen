<p class="p">Despite their potential, the use of essential oils in agriculture is limited due to their high volatility, photoinstability, and thermolability, which contribute to the need for high doses and/or numerous applications. Therefore, an association between essential oils and nanotechnology may be advantageous by decreasing the photo- and thermo-degradation of the essential oil active compounds [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Nanoparticles (NP), which generally range from 10 nm to 1000 nm in size, contain dissolved or encapsulated active compounds within their polymer matrix. Because NPs are solid, compound mobility is lower than that in liquid medium, generating a controlled release system that depends on compound diffusion through the matrix and/or on polymer erosion [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. NPs have been shown to be efficient in the release of active molecules from the active site in the polymer matrix. Thus, the slow release and the enhanced oil dispersion in aqueous media conferred by NPs may physically stabilize essential oil active molecules and increase their persistence in the field, favoring a lower number of product applications [
