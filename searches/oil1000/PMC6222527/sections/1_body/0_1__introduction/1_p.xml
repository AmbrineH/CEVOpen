<p class="p">Every year, an estimated two million tons of chemical pesticides are used on crops worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Their excessive use has caused significant environmental damage and compromised public health due to their toxic, non-biodegradable properties and the accumulation of residues in soil, water, and food [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Thus, studies focusing on alternatives to pesticides have increased in recent years [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. For this reason, essential oils have been termed “green pesticides” [
