<p class="p">Saad et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] attributed the decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic> oviposition to the volatile compounds found in citronella (
 <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon nardus</italic> L.) essential oil, which may have affected the development of the female whitefly, reducing its reproductive capacity. An example of this activity was reported by Rao et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], who found that 
 <italic class="italic">Dysdercus koenigii</italic> nymphs treated with 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia annua</italic> essential oil showed ovarian development issues, decreasing the number of produced oocytes with a consequent influence on egg production.
