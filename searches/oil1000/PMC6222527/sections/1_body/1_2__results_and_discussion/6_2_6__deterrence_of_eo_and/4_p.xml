<p class="p">In the no-choice test, the number of eggs was significantly lower in the treatment with EO at all doses than the control (Tween) (

 <xref rid="molecules-23-02052-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). NSEO reduced the number of eggs only in treatments at 0.25% and 1.5% compared to the NS control (empty nanosphereâ€”formulation without essential oil). The oviposition-deterrent effect of NSEO was observed only at the 0.25% concentration (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02052-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Similar to the free-choice test, the no-choice test showed no differences in the number of eggs between NSEO and EO at all concentrations tested. Similar results were observed by Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit essential oil decreased the number of 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic> eggs on tomato leaves by 85.7% and 94.2% for the 1.0% and 1.5% concentrations, respectively. Christofoli et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Z. rhoifolium</italic> Lam. leaf EO at 0.5% or 1.0% reduced 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic> oviposition by 71% and 77%, respectively, three days after treatment application. These authors also showed that the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. rhoifolium</italic> nanoencapsulated essential oil at the 2% and 5% doses reduced the number of eggs by 95.6% and 93.9%, respectively, when compared to the control (water). The greater oviposition reduction obtained with

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] compared to the present study may stem from the variation in the chemical composition of the essential oil. The quality and quantity of essential oil components may vary according to plant genetics, climate, soil composition, plant organ, age, and stage of the vegetative cycle, etc. [
