 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Previous studies on the encapsulation of plant extracts and essential oils using PCL as a polymer revealed pH values between 4 and 6, corroborating our results [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Low pH values (&lt;4.0) indicate degradation of the polymer and/or of some sample component. The polymer itself (PCL) can decrease pH values due to the relaxation of its polymer chains, resulting in the exposure of carboxylic acid groups. However, acidic pH values can lead to polymer hydrolysis, yielding unstable suspensions and generating sediments in sample vials [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. No sediment formation was observed before any analysis or bioassay was conducted, indicating the stability of the nanoformulations, which was also confirmed by the zeta potential (ZP) values.
