<p class="p">The nanoprecipitation method used to encapsulate the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit essential oils was based on precipitation of the polymer after addition of a nonsolvent to a solution containing the polymer. Four mechanisms occurred, namely, supersaturation, nucleation, growth by condensation, and growth by coagulation, leading to the formation of nanoparticles [

Those authors also noted that this method shows good reproducibility in the laboratory and constitutes a good strategy for nanoparticle production at an industrial scale. Other advantages offered by the method include the simple execution and the use of solvents relatively less toxic than many others, such as ethanol and acetone [
