<p class="p">The stability of the nanoparticulate systems was maintained by employing a high hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) surfactant—Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>80—which has the purpose of preventing particle coalescence and diffusion of the encapsulated active substance. The low HLB surfactant, Span
