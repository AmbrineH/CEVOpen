<p class="p">The ZP (ζ) measures the electrostatic repulsion of the particles’ electric charges. ZP values ≥30 mV or ≤−30 mV indicate good physicochemical stability of the suspension, since the repulsion between charged particles is higher, preventing coalescence driven by occasional collisions between adjacent nanoparticles [
