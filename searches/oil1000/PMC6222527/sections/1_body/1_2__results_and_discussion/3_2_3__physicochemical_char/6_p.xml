<p class="p">According to Woodruff and Hutmacher [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], nanosphere size can vary between 10 and 1000 nm. All suspensions in the present study presented nanospheres within this diameter range, with values between 106.7 and 129.2 nm (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02052-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). A significant difference existed in particle diameter values; however, the increase in the amount of essential oil (mg) did not influence this feature. According to Schaffazick et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], average nanoparticle diameters fall between 100 and 300 nm regardless of the preparation method (e.g., solvent displacement (nanoprecipitation), emulsion polymerization, or emulsification-diffusion), thus corroborating our results. Similar results were also obtained by Pinto et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], who reported a mean diameter of 173.6 nm for PCL nanocapsules containing 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia sidoides</italic> leaf essential oil formed by solvent emulsification-diffusion. Nanocapsules containing rosemary essential oil formed by nanoprecipitation showed PDs of approximately 220 nm [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] obtained nanoparticles containing garlic essential oil with approximately 233 nm in diameter using the dispersion-fusion technique.
