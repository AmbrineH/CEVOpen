<p class="p">In summary, the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit essential oil was effective as an insecticide and oviposition deterrent against 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic>. Although some results have showed that the EO killed more second-instar nymphs than the NSEO form, it presented similar activity to the synthetic insecticide cyantraniliprole. The nanoencapsulated form demonstrated similar efficiency to the EO form in the free-choice and no-choice tests for whitefly oviposition deterrence. Nanoencapsulated essential oils offer a greater advantage over the free essential oil forms, with protection conferred by the PCL polymer against photodegradation (results described herein). Through the nanoencapsulation, it is possible to optimize the maintenance of the essential oil in the field reducing the requirement of extra applications that clearly impact final cost of the crops. Given that the nanoformulated products usually display differential bioavailability in the field, a greater stability implies a greater permanence in the cultivation [

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Moreover, once essential oils are volatiles, they are easily spread in the environment, losing their ability to control insects, so we need a way for them to be fixed in the field. Thus, nanoformulation may be an option to solve this sort of practical issue. Therefore, the results presented here may be further used as the foundation to the development of commercial products using essential oils such as from fruits of
