<p class="p">According to Wilcoxonâ€™s non-parametric test, the two curves were significantly different (

The NSEO at concentrations of 1.0% and 1.5% killed 70.55% and 82.87% of the nymphs, respectively. The lowest concentrations, 0.25% and 0.5%, did not differ significantly, reducing nymph numbers by just 30.93% and 31.20%, respectively. The highest dose (1.5%) of both NSEO and EO were statistically similar to the chemical insecticide cyantraniliprole (
