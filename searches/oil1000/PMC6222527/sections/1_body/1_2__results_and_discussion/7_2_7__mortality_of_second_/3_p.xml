<p class="p">The lower activity of the NSEO compared to EO forms may also be related to the type of formulation used for nanoparticle preparation and/or to the environmental conditions. According to Soppimath et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], the release of active compounds by nanoparticles, as well as nanoparticle biodegradation, is important for a successful formulation. Release rates depend on the desorption of the active principle from the surface of the nanoparticles, their diffusion through the polymer matrix, erosion of the matrix, and erosion-associated diffusion. Therefore, diffusion and biodegradation are essential processes for the controlled release system. Depending on the formulation, the active compounds may remain entrapped in the polymer matrix, reducing product activity. De Oliveira et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Lippia sidoides</italic> essential oil-based nanoparticles with different ratios of alginate (ALG) and cashew gum (CG): 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1. The nanoparticles formed with a 3:1 ALG:CG ratio exhibited a lower, more controlled release of the essential oil (45% in 50 h), whereas an ALG:CG 1:3 ratio released 65% of the essential oils after 5 h. Thus, the nanoparticle release profile depended on the ALG:CG ratio.
