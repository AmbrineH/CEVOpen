<p class="p">A lower activity of NSEO was also observed by Carvalho et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. PCL nanoformulations containing neem oil killed 18.9% of 1st-instar 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic> nymphs, compared to 60% caused by the free form. In turn, Carvalho et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] obtained different results for two types of nanocapsules containing Azamax
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 1.2 EC, a commercial formulation enriched with azadirachtin and 3-tigloylazadirachtol. For the same concentration of Azamax, PCL, and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) nanocapsules caused the mortality of 98% and 70.6% of 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic> nymphs, respectively. This variation in results was attributed to environmental conditions, such as greater photoperiod, light intensity, or thermal amplitudes. These factors may have accelerated polymer breakdown, with a concomitant faster release of the active compound.
