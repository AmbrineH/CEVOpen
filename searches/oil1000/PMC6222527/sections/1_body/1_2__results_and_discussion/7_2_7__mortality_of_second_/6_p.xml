<p class="p">The higher efficiency of the essential oil in the second experiment is likely related to the environmental conditions, such as the lower relative humidity, corroborating Carvalho et al. [

Therefore, although the percent nymphal mortality was higher in free essential oil form, nanoencapsulates may become more advantageous by reducing photo- and thermo-degradation issues of the active compound, possibly maintaining their activity for longer periods of time [
