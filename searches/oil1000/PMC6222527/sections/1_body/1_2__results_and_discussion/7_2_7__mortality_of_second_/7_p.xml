<p class="p">Nanoencapsulation protects the active compounds in the essential oil from environmental factors (e.g., light and heat) that affect their molecular structures. UV radiation with wavelength (Î») near 350 nm is capable of breaking bonds between carbon atoms in organic molecules, thereby generating radicals that accelerate the oxidation rate of the compounds [
