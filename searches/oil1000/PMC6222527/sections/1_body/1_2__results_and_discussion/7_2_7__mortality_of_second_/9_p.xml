<p class="p">Some hypotheses can be formulated to explain nymphal susceptibility to 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> essential oil: (1) Whiteflies, for instance, possess a waxy layer on their body, which hinders insecticide penetration [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Essential oils thus have the advantage of disrupting this layer and acting on insect metabolism in several ways, including inducing mitochondrial membrane depolarization [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The decrease in membrane potential (depolarization) affects the calcium ion cycle and reduces the pH gradient, affecting the proton pump and ATP pool [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. These changes render the mitochondrial membrane abnormally permeable, which results in oxidative stress and bioenergetic failure, leading to necrosis- and apoptosis-induced cell death [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. (2) In insects, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and acetylcholine accumulation leads to excitation and death [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Some essential oil active compounds, such as monoterpenes, are competitive inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AchE). The inhibition mechanism may be related to the chemical structure of the monoterpene, comprising one methyl allyl group and a double bond [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Limonene, one of the major components of the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit essential oil, inhibited 87.42% of the AchE activity [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The compounds α-pinene and β-caryophyllene—alone or in combination—also inhibited AchE [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Moreover, monoterpenes can act lethally by interfering with the neuromodulator octopamine or the GABA-bound chloride channels [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. This feature grants essential oils a selective toxicity against insects since mammals (vertebrates) do not have octopamine receptors. (3) The insecticidal activity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit essential oil can also be attributed to the presence of compounds such as limonene and β-myrcene. Hollingsworth [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] showed that treatments containing 1% limonene caused 99% mortality of 
 <italic class="italic">Aleurodicus dispersus</italic> whiteflies. Five mg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of β-myrcene induced 100% mortality of 
 <italic class="italic">Blatella germanica</italic> adult females [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Prieto et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] attributed the insecticidal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. rhoifolium</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">Sitophilus oryzae</italic> to β-myrcene and β-phellandrene.
