<p class="p">In our study, twenty-two compounds were identified in 
 <italic class="italic">Z. riedelianum</italic> fruit essential oil (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02052-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Probably, the biological effects of this essential oil was from the synergism between all molecules, from the major molecules, or be modulated by the minor molecules as observed in others studies with essential oils [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Zarrad et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-23-02052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus aurantium</italic> L. essential oil was more toxic to 
 <italic class="italic">B. tabaci</italic> adults than pure limonene. This result revealed the additive or synergistic effect of the components of 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic> oil. The combination of different substances has the advantage of reducing the resistance of insect pests, as they decrease selection pressure, which would not occur if a single compound was used. These factors reinforce the advantages of using essential oils compared to the isolated component.
