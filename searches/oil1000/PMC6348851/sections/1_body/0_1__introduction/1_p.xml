<p class="p">Essential oils are popular in complementary medicine and often used to treat dermatological conditions. A common example is
 <italic class="italic"> Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> Cheel. (tea tree), which is known worldwide as an anti-infective essential oil and is used in many commercial acne products. These products are considered as a “safe” alternative and a preferred holistic treatment by consumers, but what has not been considered is the common use with a carrier oil. Recent findings of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils against skin pathogens prompted further research into the combined use with carrier oils [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Essential oils are rarely used undiluted when applied directly to the skin [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Neat oils have been shown to cause skin irritation such as contact dermatitis [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. They are thus blended into a base before application to the skin. This combination of essential oil and carrier oil not only dilutes the essential oils but also is believed to make the essential oils less toxic on the skin, slow down the evaporation rate, and increase essential oil absorption [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Increased absorption is achieved as carrier oils are composed of molecules which make them closely related to sebum (the skin's own natural oil). Possible bases that essential oils can be diluted into include creams, gels, or carrier oils (also known as vegetable or fixed oils) [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. It has, however, been found that a base can influence the overall antimicrobial activity of the oil [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Yet, there is a paucity of information relating to the effects of carrier oils on the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of essential oils [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]; thus this study investigates this void with special emphasis on oils implicated in dermatology and interactions affecting skin pathogens.
