<p class="p">The chemical profiles of the essential oils have been previously investigated and reported [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The chemical characterization of the carrier oils required separation via the induction of volatility by methylating and conversion of the carrier oils into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). This required the addition of 1.0 mL of hexane into 0.1 mL of the carrier oil. Thereafter, 1.0 mL sodium methoxide (1.6 g of NaOH in 50.0 mL of methanol) solution was added, and this mixture was vortexed for 30 s. This solution was then centrifuged at 1200 rpm and incubated at room temperature for 10 min to allow for the separation of the clear solution of FAMEs. The methyl esters were then transferred to a vial for analysis [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The FAME composition of each carrier oil was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (GC-MS/FID). The GC-MS/FID (Agilent 6860 N GC system) (Agilent Technologies, USA) was coupled directly to a 5973 mass selective detector (MSD) equipped with a 5% phenyl, polymethyl siloxane column (30 m× 250 mm i.d. × 0.25

 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L was injected (using a split ratio of 1:50) with an autosampler at 24.79 psi and an inlet temperature of 250°C. The GC oven temperature was initially 60°C for 10 min, rising to 250°C at a rate of 4°C/min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.0 mL/min. Spectra were obtained on the electron impact at 70 eV, scanning from 35 to 450
 <italic class="italic"> m/z</italic>. The percentage composition of the individual components was quantified by integration measurements using flame ionization detection (FID, 250°C) while the identification was based on the total ion chromatogram (TIC) using ChemStation software. Component identification was made by using available FAMEs reference compounds in combination with library searching of the Mass Finder®, Flavor®, and NIST libraries [
