<p class="p">The selection of six carrier oils was based on the aroma-therapeutic literature available to the layman as reviewed by Orchard and van Vuuren [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], where the most frequently cited carrier oils for dermatological use and those claimed as having antimicrobial activity were selected. The selection of the 23 essential oils was made based on a range of activity, representative of noteworthy, moderate, and poor antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], so that an overall understanding could be drawn of carrier oil effects against different antimicrobial potencies. Consideration was also given to essential oils with poor activity, as, in combination, they may demonstrate synergy. Popular essential oils that are well known to the layman, such as
 <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill. (lavender), were also included (See supplementary data for selection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1" class="xref">available here</xref>)). The carrier oils were obtained from Essentia. Essential oils were procured from Givaudan (Dubendorf, Switzerland), Robertet (Grasse, France), Burgess and Finch, Prana Monde, Essentia, and Scatters Oils (all Gauteng, South Africa).
