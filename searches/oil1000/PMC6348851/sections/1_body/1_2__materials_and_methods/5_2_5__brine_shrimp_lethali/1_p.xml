 <italic class="italic"> Artemia franciscana</italic> (brine shrimp) eggs (Ocean Nutrition™) (0.5 g) were added to the salt water and aerated with a rotary pump (Kiho). A constant source of warmth and light was provided with a lamp (220–240 V). The incubation of the eggs under these conditions was at 25°C for 18-24 hrs.
