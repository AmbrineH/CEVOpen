<p class="p">While dilution of the essential oils with carrier oils in most cases resulted in a slight decrease in antimicrobial activity, it was interesting to note that the antimicrobial activity of several combinations was actually enhanced when tested against selected pathogens. This was observed for combinations with
 <italic class="italic"> A. vera</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic>, which increased antimicrobial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> B. epidermidis</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> B. linens,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>. It raises the question as to whether the permeating properties exhibited by
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> carrier oil and
 <italic class="italic"> A. vera</italic> gel (carrier oil research is lacking) are able to enhance permeation into the bacterial cell wall [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], an area of investigation which should be encouraged. The carrier oil
 <italic class="italic"> H. perforatum</italic> increased the antimicrobial activity of several essential oils against
 <italic class="italic"> B. epidermidis. Calendula officinalis </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> P. americana</italic> increased the essential oil activity against
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>. What is remarkable, though, is that no antimicrobial antagonism was observed between any of the 1518 carrier oils: essential oil combinations investigated, validating the aroma-therapeutic use of combining carrier oils with essential oils.
