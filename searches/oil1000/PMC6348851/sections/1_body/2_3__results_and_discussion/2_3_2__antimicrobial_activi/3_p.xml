<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils combined with the carrier oils (1518 combinations consisting of 23 essential oils combined with six different carrier oils, against 11 pathogens involved in skin infections), along with the interactive profiles of the combinations, is displayed in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref"> Figure 1</xref> summarises the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils combined with each carrier oil, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> summarises the interactive profiles of all the studied combinations. The majority of the combinations were found to be additive (52.2%), and 45.8% were found to be indifferent. Synergy was also identified in 30 combinations, and, encouragingly, the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils, when diluted with the carrier oils, did not result in antagonism. The carrier oils that most frequently exhibited promising synergy were
