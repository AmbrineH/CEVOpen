 <italic class="italic">Aloe vera</italic> gel has been reported to display antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of the carrier oil, however, is reported for the first time in this study. As with this study,
 <italic class="italic"> P. armeniaca</italic> has also previously been reported to display poor antimicrobial activity (&gt;2.00% v/v) against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> H. perforatum </italic>was previously shown to display poor to no antimicrobial activity against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the antimicrobial activity of
 <italic class="italic"> C. officinalis</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. americana</italic> carrier oils are reported here for the first time against all 11 pathogens. Although not expected to display antimicrobial activity, the observed antimicrobial activity of the carrier oils may likely be attributed to the free fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and oleic acids, which individually have displayed antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive micro-organisms such as
 <italic class="italic"> P. acnes</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> at high concentrations [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>].
