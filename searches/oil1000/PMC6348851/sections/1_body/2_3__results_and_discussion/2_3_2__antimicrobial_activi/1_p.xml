<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils has previously been reported [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The carrier oils, overall, displayed poor antimicrobial activity (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The only bacterial species that was somewhat inhibited by the carrier oils was
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> B. epidermidis </italic>at 1.00 mg/mL for selected carrier oils. The poor antimicrobial activity is not surprising as they are not expected to exhibit antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] but rather provide other properties against skin conditions such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, or an increase in collagen synthesis [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. From an antimicrobial perspective, another two studies also reported poor antimicrobial activity of
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. When studied in combination, however, De Prijck, Peeters, and Nelis [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] reported an increase in antimicrobial activity of the
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> carrier oil and
 <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> essential oil combination tested against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>. Unfortunately, the diffusion assay was utilised, making comparison with the current study difficult and somewhat inaccurate due to the inherent flaws associated with oils and agar diffusion assays. This study, however, could report on moderate antimicrobial activity (2.00 mg/mL) for this combination. This is the first study to report on
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> against MRSA, GMRSA, acne, and bromodosis pathogens.
