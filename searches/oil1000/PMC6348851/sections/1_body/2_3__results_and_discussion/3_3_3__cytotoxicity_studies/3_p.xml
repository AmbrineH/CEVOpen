 <italic class="italic">Aloe vera</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> reduced the cytotoxicity of 14 essential oils after 24 hrs, followed by
 <italic class="italic"> H. perforatum</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> P. americana,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. armeniaca</italic> that decreased the cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils, and lastly
 <italic class="italic"> C. officinalis</italic> decreased the cytotoxicity of 11 oils. Considering that essential oils may be applied daily to the skin, this highlights
 <italic class="italic"> A. vera</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> as the carrier oils that would be most beneficial for topical use. Due to three of the carrier oils displaying no cytotoxicity at 24 hrs, the ΣFIC could not be calculated (FIC calculation requires an endpoint value); however, values could be calculated for 48 hr exposure. After 48 hrs, 18 out of 23 combinations of essential oils with
 <italic class="italic"> Aloe vera</italic> resulted in a synergistic decrease in cytotoxicity. Seventeen synergistic interactions were observed with
 <italic class="italic"> H. perforatum</italic> and 14 with
 <italic class="italic"> C. officinalis</italic>. There is a statistical significant difference between the two periods (all
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
 <italic class="italic"> Aloe vera</italic> was the carrier oil that showed the most pronounced quenching of essential oil cytotoxicity at both 24 and 48 hrs. It draws attention to whether the vitamin E in the carrier oil may contribute towards this effect. Previous studies have shown vitamin E to decrease the cytotoxicity of medicines [

 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-tocopherol has also been shown to decrease toxicity [
