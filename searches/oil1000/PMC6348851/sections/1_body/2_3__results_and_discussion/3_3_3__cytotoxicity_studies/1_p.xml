<p class="p">The percentage cytotoxicity of each carrier oil is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. None of the carrier oils were found to be toxic. In fact,
 <italic class="italic"> A. vera</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> C. officinalis </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> P. americana</italic> were found to show no trace of cytotoxicity after 24 hrs when tested in the brine shrimp lethality assay. The low cytotoxicity shown by
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> C. officinalis</italic> has also previously been observed [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The cytotoxicity of
 <italic class="italic"> H. perforatum, P. americana,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. armeniaca</italic> carrier oils, however, is reported for the first time in this study.
