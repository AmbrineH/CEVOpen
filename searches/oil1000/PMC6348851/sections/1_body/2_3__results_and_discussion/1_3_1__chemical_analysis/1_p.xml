<p class="p">The chemical composition of the essential oils has been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and is included in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. It is known that the chemical composition of essential oils may vary due to differences in chemotype, storage, harvesting, or plant origin [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. For example, the sample of
 <italic class="italic"> Thymus vulgaris</italic> from this study has a lower content of thymol (18.9%) than reported in previous studies (44.7-48.9%) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and the
 <italic class="italic"> Laurus nobilis</italic> sample used in this study contains myrcene and chavicol, as opposed to high levels of 1,8-cineole (35.5-42.3%) as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Five out of the six carrier oils contained both linoleic acid and oleic acid methyl esters (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>).
 <italic class="italic"> Aloe vera </italic>Mill. (aloe vera)
 <italic class="italic">, Calendula officinalis </italic>L. (calendula), and
 <italic class="italic"> Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. (St John's wort) are characterized by high levels of linoleic acid methyl ester (59.8-69.9%).
 <italic class="italic"> Persea americana</italic> Mill. (avocado) and
 <italic class="italic"> Prunus armeniaca</italic> Blanco (apricot kernel) are dominated by a high percentage of oleic acid, methyl ester (60.7-69.5%).
 <italic class="italic"> Simmondsia chinensis </italic>C.K.Schneid (jojoba) was found to be different from the other carrier oils with eicosenoic acid (55.6%) being the major fatty acid.
 <italic class="italic"> Aloe vera</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. americana </italic>oils also contained vitamin E.
