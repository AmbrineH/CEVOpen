<p class="p">This study can conclude that carrier oils exert a positive effect over essential oil cytotoxicity without causing antagonism of the antimicrobial activity. Synergy was frequently observed and a reduction of essential oil cytotoxicity after 48 hrs was mostly found.
 <italic class="italic"> Aloe vera</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis</italic> were identified as the carrier oils that caused the highest reduction of cytotoxicity and increased antimicrobial activity the most.
 <italic class="italic"> Aloe vera</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. chinensis, H. perforatum C. officinalis, </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> P. americana </italic>were found to increase antimicrobial activity of several essential oils against respective pathogens, including
 <italic class="italic"> B. epidermidis</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> B. linens,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic>. Additional studies could include different chemotypes as well as the essential oil:carrier oil combinations where carrier oils are used at a higher ratio, especially against the more toxic essential oils. The carrier oils are also presented as an option for use in dermatology to decrease cytotoxicity of medicines that cause skin irritation.
