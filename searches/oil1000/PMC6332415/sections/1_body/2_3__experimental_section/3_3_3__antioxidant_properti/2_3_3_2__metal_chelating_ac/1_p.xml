<p class="p">Ferrous ion chelating activity was estimated as described by Ksouri 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Briefly, different concentrations of essential oil (1, 5, and 15 mg/mL) were added to 0.05 mL of 2 mM FeCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>·4H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O solution and left for incubation at room temperature for 5 min. Afterwards, the reaction was initiated by adding 0.1 mL of 5 mM ferrozine and the mixture was adjusted to 3 mL with deionized water, shaken vigorously, and left standing at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance of the solution was then measured at 562 nm. EDTA (5–100 µg/mL) was used as a positive control. The percentage of inhibition of ferrozine-Fe

 <disp-formula class="disp-formula"> Metal chelating activity MCA (%) = [(A

  <sub class="sub">s</sub>)/A
  <sub class="sub">c</sub>] × 100

 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> is the absorbance of the control and A
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> is the absorbance of the sample (essential oil or EDTA standard solutions). Results were expressed as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values are the concentrations required to chelate 50% of ferrous ions present in the system. Analyses were run in triplicates.
