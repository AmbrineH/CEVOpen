<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> L. essential oil tested against 30 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. microorganisms was examined both qualitatively (inhibition zone diameter) and quantitatively (MIC and MBC values). Moreover, its potency to inhibit and eradicate the biofilm formed on polystyrene surface (XTT assay) was tested in the present study (
 <xref rid="molecules-20-14402-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The results showed that the studied essential oil had substantial anti-
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. activity with zones of growth inhibition (mm) scored in Mueller-Hinton agar-1% NaCl ranging from 7 ± 0 mm for 
 <italic class="italic">V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 17749 to 21.33 ± 0.58 mm for 
 <italic class="italic">V. alginolyticus</italic> (Malaga, Spain). Interestingly, 
 <italic class="italic">V. alginolyticus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V. vulnificus</italic> strains isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sparus aurata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Mytilus edulis</italic> were more sensitive to the spearmint essential oil than the two 
 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> strains associated with 
 <italic class="italic">M. edulis</italic> from the Bizerte Lagoon (10.00 and 11.67 mm, respectively). The essential oil bacteriostatic activity was confirmed by the low MIC values, ranging from 0.023 to 0.047 mg/mL, while higher concentrations were needed for a bactericidal action (MBC values ranging from 0.75 to 12 mg/mL).
