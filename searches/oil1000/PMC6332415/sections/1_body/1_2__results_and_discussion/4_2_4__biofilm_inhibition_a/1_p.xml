<p class="p">The discovery of anti-infective agents, active not only against planktonic micro-organisms but also against microbial biofilms, represents an important goal. In fact, prevention of the biofilm formation effect of plant derivatives has been reported in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, and oral pathogens; however, few studies reported the same effect on pathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. In this study we tested the ability of different concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil to inhibit or eradicate biofilm on a polystyrene surface formed by four pathogenic 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. species, 
 <italic class="italic">V. vulnificus</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">V. cholerae</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">V. alginolyticus</italic>. Our results showed that spearmint essential oil inhibited the tested 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. Strainsâ€™ biofilm production by 11.5% and 11.6% for 
 <italic class="italic">V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 33787, and by 28% and 40% for 
 <italic class="italic">V. vulnificus</italic> ATCC 27562 at 0.046 and 0.092 mg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-20-14402-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). As regards the 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> preformed biofilm disruption (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-20-14402-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), the spearmint essential oil eradicated more than 50% of preformed 
 <italic class="italic">V. cholerae</italic> ATCC 9459 and 
 <italic class="italic">V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 3378 biofilms at 0.092 mg/mL. The fact that any activity was reliable only at concentrations higher than the MIC values leads us to believe that such activities are due to the bacteriostatic activity of the essential oil rather than to the presence of compounds affecting the biofilm formation.
