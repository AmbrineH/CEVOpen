 <xref rid="B74-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] studied the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> (ethanolic extracts) on growth and biofilm formation in a methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 33593). In 2009, Rasooli and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] studied the chemical composition and the effect of Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil on dental biofilm and reported that the oil (chemotype limonene/piperitone) was active against caryogenic bacteria with a diameter of zone inhibition of about 60 mm against 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic> and 46 mm against 
 <italic class="italic">S. pyogenes</italic>, and that it retards biofilm formation. Moreover, Mousavi 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] found that the MIC of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> was 16 Î¼g/mL. They also showed that all essential oils tested at 1/2 and 1/4 MIC significantly reduced all 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence factors tested. At 1/8 MIC, 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> oil had effect just on adhesion, but 
 <italic class="italic">Cuminum cyminum</italic> oil had effect on alginate production, biofilm formation, swimming, and twitching.
