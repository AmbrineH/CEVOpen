 <xref rid="molecules-20-14402-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Thirty-four compounds were identified, representing 99.9% of the total compounds. The oil contains 50.6% oxygenated monoterpenes, 45.1% monoterpene hydrocarbons, and 2.8% of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The main constituents were carvone (40.8% ± 1.23%) and limonene (20.8% ± 1.12%), followed by 1,8-cineole (17.0% ± 0.60%), β-pinene (2.2% ± 0.25%), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-dihydrocarvone (1.9% ± 0.49%), and dihydrocarveol (1.7% ± 0.31%). The oil yield of this Tunisian variety of spearmint was 1.1% and it can be ascribed to the carvone/limonene chemotype. In fact, there is large variation in the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic>, wild as well as cultivated, around the world. Indeed, a series of chemotypes have been described in previous studies, with prevalence of pulegone, carvone, linalool, piperitone, piperitone oxide, menthone/isomenthone, pulegone/menthone/isomenthone, and pulegone/piperitone [
