 <xref rid="B10-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], chitosan has been extensively studied to obtain antibacterial coatings [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Chitosan was also used to encapsulate another antibacterial agent, nisin [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], which, in combination with chitosan, could improve the antimicrobial activity of the coatings [
