<p class="p">In the present work, the polylactic acid (PLA) films were coated by electrospinning with bio-formulations containing chitosan and one of the two vegetable oils (i.e., clove and argan oils), which were chosen due to their different compositions. According to the literature data, acylglycerols constitute 99% of the argan oil composition, while the unsaponifiable matter contains tocopherols, squalene, sterols, and phenols as the main antioxidant compounds [

 <xref rid="B28-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Eugenol (~80%) is the main volatile component of clove oil, which is responsible for its strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activities [

The different compositions of the two types of oils are expected to result in different antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the coated PLA films, and also in different rheological properties, which, in turn, will determine differences in the morphologies of the electrospun coated layers at nanoscale level.
