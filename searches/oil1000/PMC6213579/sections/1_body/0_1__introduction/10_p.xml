<p class="p">PLA films were coated with active bio-formulations with the intention to combine the biodegradability and mechanical properties of PLA substrate polymer with the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and biological functions of clove and argan oils, in combination with the chitosan. The oils were encapsulated in chitosan by coaxial electrospinning so as to prolong their functions as antimicrobial and antioxidant agents over a long time, to prevent their degradation and loss during the processing conditions, and also to prevent their rapid diffusion and migration into the packaged food.</p>
