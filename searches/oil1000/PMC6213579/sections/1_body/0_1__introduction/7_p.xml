<p class="p">(b) The thickness of the coated (deposited) layer can be easily controlled by changing the deposition time or the flow rate of the electrospinning solutions. Thus, it is possible to obtain a very thin coating (nanocoating) with a very small quantity of materials, which in many cases is enough to obtain the desired antibacterial and antioxidant [

 <xref rid="B24-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]), the very thin layer (100 nm or even less) has the added advantage of requiring a low amount of the coating material.
