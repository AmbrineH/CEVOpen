<p class="p">In this work, electrospinning/electrospraying is used as the coating technique. The properties of the coatings, containing the essential and cold-pressed oils, depend on the way they are distributed onto the base polymer (substrate) and also on the way they make contact with the food. In this respect, the nanoscale dimensions and high area-to-volume ratio of the electrospun/electrosprayed nanostructures (nanofibers and nanoparticles), help to improve the contact between the coatings and the packed food, while the encapsulation of the essential and vegetable oils, into the polymeric nanostructures, helps to maintain their antibacterial and antioxidant activities over a longer time period. Therefore, electrospinning/electrospraying is an effective and convenient method to obtain nanocoatings [
