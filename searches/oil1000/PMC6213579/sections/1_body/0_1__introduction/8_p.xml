<p class="p">(c) Plasticizers are often added to the chitosan coating layer [
 <xref rid="B12-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] to overcome the brittleness exhibited during the package deformation, and to improve the flexibility and processability. As a coating layer, the nanofibers can exhibit better ductility than the corresponding bulk material [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] due to low-nanofiber crystallinity, which resulted from rapid solidification of the ultrafine electrospun jets [
 <xref rid="B26-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Thus, it is expected that the nanosized electrospun coating layers will exhibit the needed flexibility, either in the form of nanofibers or nanoparticles, without the plasticizer addition.
