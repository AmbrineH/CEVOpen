<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of PLA (NATIVIA) coated films was measured by DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) free radical assay [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The samples (coated films) were immersed in the DPPH solution and the decrease of the absorbance at 517 nm, which reflected the amount of DPPH radicals in the solution, was measured by means of a Cary 60-UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA). The measurements were done at different immersion times (after 0, 15, 40 and 60 h immersion time). The DPPH solution (in the absence of the coated films) was used as a control. The radical scavenging activity (RSA) of the samples was expressed by the relative decrease in DPPH absorbance at 517 nm (RSA = 1−A
 <sub class="sub">SAMPLE</sub>(t)/A
 <sub class="sub">DPPH</sub>(t) where A
 <sub class="sub">DPPH</sub>(t) and A
 <sub class="sub">SAMPLE</sub>(t) are the absorbance of the control and sample at the time of measurement). For testing, a 4 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> area of the coated film was cut into pieces and immersed in 1.5 mL of DPPH solution in methanol with a concentration of 8 micrograms/mL. Before immersion and testing, the samples were stored for seven days at room temperature. Between measurements the solutions were stored in the dark at 24 °C.
