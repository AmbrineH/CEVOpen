 <sub class="sub">3</sub>N
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (10 nm curvature radius). The root mean square roughness was calculated from the total image sample after a second-order flatness treatment of the raw data. NT-MDT Nova v.1.26.0.1443 software (NT-MDT Spectrum Instruments, Moscow, Russia) was used for the acquisition and analysis of the images.
