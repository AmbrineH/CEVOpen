<p class="p">The second test was performed as it is described in the ISO 16649-2/2007: Microbiology of alimentary and animal products. There are several phases in the procedure for testing antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhymurium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic>: Sterilization of samples; inoculation with ATCC culture bacteria; 24 and 48 h (at 44 °C) inoculation and incubation, respectively; and the identification of target germs. Sterilization of the samples was performed for 20 min at 0.5 bar and at 110 °C, in an autoclave. Formation of the ATCC cultures was performed by seeding the average pre-enrichment, followed by incubation for 24 h at 37 °C; counting the number of colonies in the 0.1 mL culture after the culture medium separation; and then seeding 0.1 mL of bacterial culture ATCC, using sterile swab samples taken from the surface. The following standardized bacteriological procedures were employed in order to identify the target germs: For 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, the SR ISO 16649, horizontal method for beta-glucuronidase-positive 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> quantification, was used. Then colonies were counted at 44 °C using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-glucuronide according to Minerals Modified Glutamate Broth (Cat. 1365), which produce blue or green–blue colonies on agar glucuronide; for 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> SR EN ISO 11290 was used; and for 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> sp., SR EN ISO 6579/2003/AC/2004/AC/2006, Amd.1:2007 was used.
