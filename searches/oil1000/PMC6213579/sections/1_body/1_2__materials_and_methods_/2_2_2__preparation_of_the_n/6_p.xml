<p class="p">Both of the chitosan and oil solutions had the same concentration of 1.5 wt%. Chitosan was dissolved in 9:1 glacial acetic acid and water, respectively, argan oil was dissolved in chloroform, and clove oil was dissolved in glacial acetic acid. Electrospinning parameters (for all samples) were 1 kV/cm electrical field strength, 1.2 Î¼L/min feed rate (for both the inner and outer needle), and 30 min deposition time. To be sure of complete solvent removal, the electrospun nanostructures were placed for two days in a vacuum desiccator (Binder GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany). The absence of the acetic acid in the deposited mesh in was confirmed by IR spectroscopy (using a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer, Ettlingen, Germany).</p>
