<p class="p">The low surface energy of polymeric substrates often leads to poor adhesion of the coatings to the substrates. To improve the adhesion, the surface is usually activated or functionalized by corona [

Before getting coated with the chitosanâ€“oil formulations by electrospinning, the PLA substrates were treated by exposure to cold plasma (nitrogen gas discharge atmosphere, 1.3 MHz frequency, 100 W power, 0.4 mbar pressure). Plasma treatment, and the consequent air exposure, leads to the implementation of some functionalities on the surface, such as groups and free radicals containing nitrogen and oxygen, which are able to interact with functional groups of the components of the nanocoating that were deposited by electrospinning [
