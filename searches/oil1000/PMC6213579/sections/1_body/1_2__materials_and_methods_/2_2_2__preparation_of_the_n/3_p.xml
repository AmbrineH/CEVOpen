<p class="p">After plasma treatment, the coaxial electrospinning was applied to obtain oil-loaded nanostructures, by encapsulating the clove or argan oil into the chitosan nanostructures, simultaneous with being coated onto the plasma-treated PLA substrates. The coaxial system consisted of chitosan supplied to the outer nozzle and oil solutions supplied to the inner nozzle. </p>
