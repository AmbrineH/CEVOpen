<p class="p">The electrospinning system, used for coating the PLA foils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01973-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), consisted of a high voltage supply (HV), a rotating metallic-plate collector, and two syringes with a coaxial needle oriented perpendicular to the metal plate. The PLA substrate film was placed on the metallic collector. The high direct voltage (0 to 30 kV) was applied between the metal plate and the metallic needle.
