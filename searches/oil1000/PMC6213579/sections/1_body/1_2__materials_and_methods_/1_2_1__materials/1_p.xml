<p class="p">Chitosan with two different average molecular weights (MW) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany): Highly viscous chitosan (Chit-H), MW = 310,000–375,000 g/mol, deacetylation degree DD ≈ 77% [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], with a dynamic viscosity in 1% acetic acid (20 °C) &gt; 400 mPa·s; and low viscous chitosan (Chit-L), MW = 50,000–190,000, DD ≈ 87% [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], with viscosity in 1% acetic acid of 20–300 cP. The range values for MW (average molecular weight) were taken from producer specifications.
