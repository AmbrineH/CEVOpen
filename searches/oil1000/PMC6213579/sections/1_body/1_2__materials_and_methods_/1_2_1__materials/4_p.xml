<p class="p">Two types of PLA films were coated: (a) Hot-pressed films obtained from PLA 2002D pellets (from NatureWorks LLC, Minnetonka, MN, USA), and (b) commercial NATIVIA
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> NTSS 40 µm PLA foils (from Taghleef Industries, Newark, DE, USA). The hot-pressed PLA substrates with a thickness of 0.30 ± 0.05 mm were obtained using a Carver press at 175 °C (2 min pre-melting and 2 min pressing at 240 bar). The NATIVIA
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> commercial PLA foils (Taghleef Industries, Newark, DE, USA) were used in order to test the applicability of this coating method for commercial products that currently exist in the market.
