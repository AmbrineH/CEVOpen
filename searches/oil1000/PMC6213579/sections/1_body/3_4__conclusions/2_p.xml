<p class="p">Polylactic acid (PLA) films were coated by coaxial electrospinning with formulations containing essential or vegetable oils (clove and argan oils, respectively) and encapsulated into chitosan in order to obtain biodegradable packaging materials with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. When chitosan with high MW (Chit-H) was used, the coaxial electrospinning produced beaded chitosan nanofibers, with the oil distributed and encapsulated along the main chitosan fiber. Chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating the oil were obtained with low-MW chitosan (Chit-L). The roughness of the coating layer was higher for the samples prepared with Chit-H compared with samples prepared with Chit-L. The PLA films coated with chitosan–oil formulations had higher antibacterial activity than the films coated only with chitosan. The clove oil had higher antibacterial activity than the argan oil, for both types of chitosan, because of its higher phenolic content. Chit-H samples had higher antibacterial activity compared with Chit-L, for both types of oil, due to the higher specific surface area of the rougher nanofibrous morphology of the coating layer. As was expected, due to the phenolic content of clove oil, the chitosan–clove oil combination had higher antioxidant activity compared to the simple chitosan coating. Considering the volatility of the clove oil, its immobilization into the coating layer can be realized by encapsulation in chitosan. The TEM results and the antioxidant tests also confirm the encapsulation of the oil into the chitosan.</p>
