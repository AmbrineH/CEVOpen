<p class="p">There are also studies showing that the bacterial attachment decreases when the exposed substrate surfaces (such as polydopamine [
 <xref rid="B68-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]) have higher roughness [
 <xref rid="B69-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], for both gram-positive bacteria (GP-b) and gram-negative bacteria (GN-b) [
 <xref rid="B71-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Some authors have found that GP-b (which has a more rigid membrane than GN-b) are more sensitive to roughness than GN-b, due to the surface nano-irregularities, which limit the number of anchoring points for GP-b bacteria. In this way, the surface area in contact with the membrane is reduced, which in turn reduces the adhesion of GP-b to the rougher surface [
 <xref rid="B72-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Additionally, it was hypothesized that air entrapped by the topographical features inhibited contact between 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and the substrate [
 <xref rid="B74-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Our results agree with these reports. Furthermore, among Chit-H samples, the GP-b 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> (for the samples HA, HA-NATIVIA, and HC-NATIVIA after 48 h) had maximum inhibition. This confirms the above-mentioned results, which state that the GP-b are more sensitive to roughness, and make us conclude that the higher antibacterial activity of the Chit-H samples was attributed to the higher roughness of the coating.
