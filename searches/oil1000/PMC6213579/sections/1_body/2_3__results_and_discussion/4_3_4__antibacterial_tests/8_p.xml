<p class="p">Indeed, it is reported in literature that chitosan had lower antibacterial activity for higher MWs [
 <xref rid="B53-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], for both gram-positive bacteria (GP-b) [
 <xref rid="B55-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] and gram-negative bacteria (GN-b) [
 <xref rid="B56-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. This effect is reported to take place for MWs higher than 100 kDa [
 <xref rid="B57-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], and some authors even report low activity for MWs &gt; 30 kDa [
 <xref rid="B58-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. As the MW of the chitosan types used in this work was higher than this threshold (50–200 kDa for Chit-L and 300–370 kDa for Chit-H) [
 <xref rid="B57-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], we conclude that the higher antibacterial activity of Chit-H (for the same type of oil) cannot be attributed to its higher MW.
