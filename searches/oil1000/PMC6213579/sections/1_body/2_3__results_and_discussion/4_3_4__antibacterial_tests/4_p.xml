<p class="p">Also, both tests showed that the combination Chit-Hâ€“oil had higher antibacterial effect than Chit-H coated alone (
 <xref rid="materials-11-01973-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 4) and, therefore, indicates that improved antibacterial activity could be obtained by coating the PLA films with chitosan. In addition, the coaxial encapsulation of the clove and argan oils, electrospun together with the chitosan, led to enhanced antimicrobial activity for both NATIVIA and hot-pressed PLA films.
