<p class="p">Moreover, the different DD for the two types of chitosan cannot explain the higher antibacterial activity for the Chit-H (for the same type of oil). There are many papers reporting higher antibacterial activity for higher DD of chitosan [

Our results, showing lower antibacterial activity for the chitosan with higher DD (DD ≈ 87% for Chit-L compared to DD ≈ 77% for Chit-H) are opposed to the reports presented above, and also to another report which showed higher antibacterial activity for chitosan with higher DD and lower MW [
