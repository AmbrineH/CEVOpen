<p class="p">It is interesting to compare the width (range) of the particle and fiber diameter distributions, determined from the AFM images, with the width of the AFM height distribution (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01973-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The width of the AFM height distribution was similar to the width of the particle AFM diameter distributions for the LA and LC samples, but was much wider than the particle and fiber diameter distributions for the HA and HC samples.
