<p class="p">This is because, compared with the HA and HC samples, the LA and LC samples had a more compact particle arrangement, with smaller voids between them, which narrowed the height distribution. This was also shown by other authors [

 <xref rid="B45-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], who correlated the roughness (or the width of the height distribution) of nanoparticle layers with the experimentally measured nanoparticle sizes, and also with the way the particles are packed [
 <xref rid="B44-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. For a closely (or orderly) packed spherical structure, with spheres tangent to one another (particle-near-particle), the roughness is low and the AFM height distribution approaches the particle diameter distribution (roughness approaches the average diameter of the particles). But when the same particles are randomly packed in a more porous arrangement, the roughness increases [
 <xref rid="B45-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Thus, it can be concluded that, for the LA and LC samples, the structures were more compact with lower porosity (smaller voids between particles) and, consequently, with narrower height distribution than the HA and HC samples.
