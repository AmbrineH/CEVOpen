<p class="p">In a second test, the sample with higher antioxidant activity (HC-NATIVIA) was chosen to measure the antioxidant activity over the immersion time. Before testing, the samples were stored for seven days at room temperature, in order to check the encapsulation and persistency of the volatile clove oil in the samples. The results were compared with the corresponding uncoated (NATIVIA) and chitosan coated film (H-NATIVIA). In this second test, a higher film area (4 cm

The concentration of biphenyl radicals continued to decrease (RSA increased) in the solution containing the immersed film relative to the control sample, even after 70 h of immersion. The antioxidant activity of the uncoated NATIVIA, which was lowest among the tested samples, was due to the residual lactic acid in the films.
