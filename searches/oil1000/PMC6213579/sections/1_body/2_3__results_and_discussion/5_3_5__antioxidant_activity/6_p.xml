<p class="p">Of these three samples, PLA-NATIVIA
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> films (HC-NATIVIA) coated with chitosan–clove oil had the highest antioxidant activity. In spite of the high volatility of the clove oil [

 <xref rid="B82-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], the antioxidant activity of the HC-NATIVIA was maintained even after seven days of shelf storage. This shows that clove oil can be efficiently immobilized into the coating layer by encapsulation in chitosan. Therefore, the antioxidant tests confirmed the TEM results and the presence of the encapsulated clove oil into the chitosan fibers, which results in a combined effect obtained by simultaneous use of chitosan and clove oil.
