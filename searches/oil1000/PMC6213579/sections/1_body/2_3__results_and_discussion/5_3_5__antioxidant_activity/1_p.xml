<p class="p">It is known that it is advisable to perform the antioxidant tests with fresh DPPH solutions. However, if prolonged experiments are required (as are further presented in this section), the DPPH test can also be performed with solutions prepared tens of hours before testing without a substantial reduction in the activity of DPPH [
 <xref rid="B75-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. In order to test the stability of our DPPH solution, the absorbance of the DPPH (control) solution was measured over time. After 70 h (solution stored in the dark) the absorbance of the DPPH solution was about 80% of the initial value (with an almost linear decrease). This result is in line with other experimental results of other authors, which show that, after 24 h post preparation, the free radical activity of 0.1 mM DPPH methanolic solution was still very similar to that of the fresh preparation (about 20% activity was lost after about 120 h) [
