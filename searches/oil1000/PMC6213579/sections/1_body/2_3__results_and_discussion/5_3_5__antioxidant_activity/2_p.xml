<p class="p">It has been previously shown that it is possible to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of various compounds without preliminary solvent extraction. The reaction between the radical and the antioxidant occurs at the interface, when they come into contact, or by liquid diffusing into the interior of the reacting solid [

 <xref rid="B80-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. In our study a similar approach was used: A small area of the coated films was cut into pieces and immersed into the methanolic DPPH radical solution. The antioxidant activity of the coated films was expressed by the relative decrease in DPPH absorbance at 517 nm:
