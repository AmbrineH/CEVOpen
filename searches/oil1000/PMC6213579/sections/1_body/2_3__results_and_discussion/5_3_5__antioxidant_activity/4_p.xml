<p class="p">In the first test, a 1 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> area, from the HC-NATIVIA and HA-NATIVIA freshly coated films, was cut into pieces and immersed for 24 h in 1.5 mL of DPPH solution in methanol (8 μg/mL). This first test evidenced the higher antioxidant activity of the samples containing clove oil. The RSA values were 0.29 for the HC-NATIVIA sample and 0.17 for the HA-NATIVIA sample. These results were in good agreement with the higher phenolic content in clove essential oil compared with argan oil. Due to high eugenol content, the concentration required to scavenge 50% of 2,2’-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radicals (half inhibitory concentration) was much higher for argan oil (~5800 µg/mL) compared with clove oil (~8 µg/mL) [
