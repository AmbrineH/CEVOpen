<p class="p">It is well known that sufficient chain entanglements should occur in the electrospun solution [

Thus, the presence of fibers for the HA and HC samples could be explained by the high MW of chitosan, which resulted in better macromolecular entanglements in the electrospun solution. Due to the low MW, the chain entanglements in LA and LC samples were not enough [
