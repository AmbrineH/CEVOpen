<p class="p">The beads-into-fiber structure of the HA and HC samples can be explained by the different molecular structure and viscosities of the shell and core solutions used in the coaxial system, that is, a highly viscous (&gt;400 mPa·s) electrospinnable macromolecular (Chit-H) shell solution and a sprayable oil core solution with very low viscosity (1–2 mPa·s). It is known that the similarity between the rheological properties of the core and shell solutions control the viscous dragging exerted by the shell solution on the core solution [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. If the viscosity of the core solution is too low, compared with the shell solution, the viscous drag exerted by the shell solution is unable to overcome the cohesive forces of the core solution [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This was the case for the solutions used for the HA and HC samples. The entanglements provided by the highly viscous shell Chit-H solution were enough to prevent fiber rupture, which can be caused by low viscosity of the core oil solution, but, due to the low viscosity, the core oil solution was unable to follow the stretching of the macromolecular shell solution [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], thus taking the form of beads into the chitosan fibers [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. It can also be observed that the HA and HC samples had a similar fiber diameter (10–20 nm), which supports the assertion that the HA and HC fibers were mostly made of Chit-H and the oil was encapsulated into the beads along the fibers. Similar morphologies, with beads-into-fiber structures, were obtained by other authors for proteins [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] or dexamethasone [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] encapsulated along the polymeric nanofibers as beads, which can act as depots for sustained drug release [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Other authors reported that coaxial electrospining employed to encapsulate sunflower oil into PEO produced beaded fibers, with the oil encapsulated into the beads [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The authors also reported that the oil was confined or encapsulated solely inside these beads [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This is in good agreement with our findings, that is, the fibers contained mainly chitosan and the oil was distributed as beads along the main chitosan fiber.
