<p class="p">From the TEM images, another observation can be made regarding the morphology of the HA and HC samples: The beads distributed along the Chit-H fibers were much more elongated for the HA sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01973-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a) compared with the HC sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01973-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b). Because a higher viscosity of the core fluid increases the viscous drag, exerted by the shell solution onto the low molecular core fluid [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], the more elongated argan oil beads can be explained by the higher viscosity of the argan oil compared with the clove oil. Considering the rapid evaporation of the solvent during the jet stretching [
 <xref rid="B41-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], it is more relevant to compare the viscosities of pure oils instead of the oil solutions. In our case, argan oil was ten times more viscous (~0.6 poise [
 <xref rid="B42-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]) than the clove oil (~0.06 poise [
 <xref rid="B43-materials-11-01973" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]), which explains the more elongated argan oil beads.
