<p class="p">Therefore, nanostructured chitosan morphologies were obtained by electrospinning, with clove and argan oils encapsulated as beads into the chitosan nanofibers or nanoparticles. The nanofibres were predominant in the samples obtained from the electro-spinnable Chit-H. Nanoparticles were obtained when Chit-L was used. </p>
