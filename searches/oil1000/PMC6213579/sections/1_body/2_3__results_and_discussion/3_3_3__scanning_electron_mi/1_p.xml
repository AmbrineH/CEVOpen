<p class="p">The SEM images for the HC-NATIVIA coated sample show the presence of nanofibers with diameters around 60–70 nm (

 <sup class="sup">®</sup> PLA commercial foils, the hot-pressed PLA films experienced sample damage due to high electron acceleration during the SEM analysis, which lowered the resolution of the SEM images. Based on the presence of nitrogen, the SEM-EDX analysis was used to investigate the presence of chitosan on the PLA substrate. The mapping of nitrogen distribution, with an average nitrogen content of 5–6%, revealed a uniform coating on the surface at a micrometric scale.
