For meat packaging applications, the contact between the antibacterial coated layer and the meat packaged is realized by means of the moist layer, which exists between the packaging foil and the meat. If we consider a moist layer with a thickness of approximately 1 mm is in contact with the meat, the oil concentration throughout the moist layer would be ~4 μg/mL, which is well above the minimum inhibitory concentration of clove oil against
