<p class="p">It appears that microwave irradiation heating is a prospective technique for enhancing the morphology of a biosorbent. The physically activated coconut shell sorbent was pretreated using microwave irradiation heating and applied for colour removal from palm oil mill effluent (POME). SEM analysis of the resulting sorbents revealed that more cracks and porous structures were created after the pretreatment. The transformation was due to the microwave heating which prompted the precursor to undergo structural changes. This justifies the crack formation along with the increase in the carbon composition from 95.03 to 98.93%, (EDX analysis). The microwave irradiation pretreatment shows excellent efficacy in the increase of the S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub> as well as the P
 <sub class="sub">v</sub>. Over 66% increase in SBET was achieved in addition to the 86.67% P
 <sub class="sub">v</sub> increment. Furthermore, the performance of the pretreated sorbent for colour removal from POME was examined using RSM. The regression model predicted the colour removal with good accuracy of 0.9263 R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Noticeably, as the pH decreased, the percentage of colour removal increased. Similarly, a higher sorbent dosage provides more active sites and this favours efficient colour removal. Undert the optimum treatment condition of 3.208 g dosage, pH of 7 and 35 min of contact time, the average colour removal was 96.29%. The adsorption equilibrium of 14301.1 ADMI × mL/g was obtained at the highest initial concentration of 2025 ADMI. The obtained equilibrium data were fitted with Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm model, it was observed that the Freundlich Model fitted better with the data with a 0.9851 correlation (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). Thus, this study verified that microwave irradiation heating can enhance the morphology of coconut shell sorbent, and the adsorption process followed a Freudlich isotherm model at 27 °C.
