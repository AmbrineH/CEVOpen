<p class="p">The Freundlich isotherm model assumes heterogeneous surface absorption and it describes the sorption from a liquid media onto the solid interface [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The important Freundlich constants normally used to describe the nature of the sorption process include 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">K
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic>, and they were determined from the slope and intercept of 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-02200" class="xref">Figure S3 (Supplementary Data)</xref>, respectively. Essentially, the constant n denotes the heterogeneity of the sorption process such that a magnitude of less than 1 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> &lt; 1), equal to 1 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 1) or greater than 1 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> &gt; 1) indicates the prevalence of chemical, linear or physical adsorption, respectively [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In addition, the reciprocal of the constant (1/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>) implies normal sorption; meaning that the adsorption process is favourable [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. In the current study, the values of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>, 1/
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">K
  <sub class="sub">F</sub>
 </italic> and R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> were 1.031, 0.9758 and 0.9851, (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02200-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Based on this result, it can be deduced that the prevalence of normal adsorption is favourable and the high R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value (0.9851) suggested excellent fit with the Freundlich isotherm model, (
