<p class="p">The experimental data of the adsorption equilibrium capacity were validated using the popular Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models based on a linear regression technique. Basically, the fitting of the experimental data into the isotherm models assisted in describing the adsorption process using the modelâ€™s constants and coefficients of correlations (R
