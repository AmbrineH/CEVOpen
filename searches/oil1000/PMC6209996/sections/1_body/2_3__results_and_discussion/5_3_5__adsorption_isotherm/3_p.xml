<p class="p">Langmuir isotherm model assumes a definite amount of active sites for the adsorption process and that the sorption is only in a monolayer with constant adsorption energy [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. The K
 <sub class="sub">L</sub> and q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> are the essential constants and they were determined from the intercept and slope of

 <italic class="italic">K
  <sub class="sub">L</sub>
 </italic> is related to the efficacy of the active sites to bind the adsorbate. Thus, higher 
 <italic class="italic">K
  <sub class="sub">L</sub>
 </italic> implies stronger adhesion of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In the current study, the value of the 
 <italic class="italic">K
  <sub class="sub">L</sub>
 </italic> was 0.7257, which seems low and may not favour strong binding of the adsorbate onto the activated carbon. More so, the 
 <italic class="italic">q</italic>
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> and the model correlation (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) with experimental data were 0.00003 g/mL and 0.0127, respectively. The low values further confirmed that the Langmuir model was less favourable for the adsorption of the colour from POME solution at 27 Â°C, as clearly shown in
