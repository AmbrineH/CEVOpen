<p class="p">Overall, the increase in C composition was due to interior heating which induced oxidation processes that released volatile matter [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. This resulted in the gross differences in the weight composition and elements contained in the pretreated and non-pretreated CSAC [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Furthermore, the induced internal heating also accounted for the surface metamorphosis and the formation of more porous structure, cleavages as well as the aperture on the pretreated CSAC to give a better platform for adsorption process [
