<p class="p">EDX tests were conducted to compare the intensities of the constituted elements present in the non-pretreated and pretreated CSAC. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-02200" class="xref">Figure S1</xref> depicts the intensities of the elements present in the non-pretreated sorbent (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-02200" class="xref">Supplementary Data</xref>). The constituent elements include carbon (C), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), chlorine (Cl) and potassium (K) at different percentage compositions, (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-02200" class="xref">Figure S2, Supplementary Data</xref>). The carbon (C) composition increased to 98.93%, while the O, Si and K values were reduced considerably. Noticeably, Cl is completely absent in the EDX analysis of the microwave-pretreated CSAC along with the diminished percentage composition of all other constituent elements (O, Si and K,
