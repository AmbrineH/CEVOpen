<p class="p">From the figures, it can be deduced that mesoporous (20–100 Å) and macroporous (&gt;100 Å) size distributions are common in the two sorbents (non-pretreated and pretreated). However, a considerable increase in the mesopore and macropore volume was observed after microwave irradiation heating (

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. They confirmed that microwave heating contributes to the progressive creation of ultramicropores and this accounted for the overall increase in the P
