<p class="p">Ultimately, the microwave irradiation heating rearranges the structure of the carbon to form a more orderly and porous matrix, thereby widening the pores and increasing the surface area [

In recap, the pore enlargement and regeneration take place in four distinct phases: widening of the remote pores, restructuring to create new pores, expansion of existing pores and unification of the current pores due to collapsing of the pore wall [

The induced internal heat engaged the cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose content in the precursor to undergo dehydration, bond breakage and reformation as well as polymerization to create a more porous and larger surface area [
