<p class="p">A comparison appraisal of the surface morphology of the sorbents (non-pretreated and pretreated CSAC) of the current study with other literature values previously reported under optimum activation conditions are presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02200-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. It is obvious that the S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub> of the microwave pretreated CSAC is much higher. The previously reported coconut shell sorbents were only activated using the physical method of activation while the present studies enhanced the morphology of the procured sorbent using microwave irradiation heating. It can be deduced that the enhancement of the specific surface area and the significant change in the morphology were due to the microwave pretreatment through a progressive widening of the ultra micropores and regeneration of more pores [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The temperature limit (900 °C) applied for the microwave pretreatment in this study was adopted from Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], and they reported a very high S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub> with a value of 2194 m

 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02200-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). According to the authors, the resulting large S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub> was due to the double stage activation processes along with the type of agents used [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The double stage activation technique requires a temperature of 1000 °C to proceed the carbonation process under a steady supply of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (active agent) [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The second stage involves microwave heating of the carbonated precursor at 900 °C. However, these processes amounted to excessive application of energy and modus complication, even though higher S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub> was obtained.
