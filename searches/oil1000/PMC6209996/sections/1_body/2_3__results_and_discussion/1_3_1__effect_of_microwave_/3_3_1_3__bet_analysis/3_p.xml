 <sub class="sub">BET</sub> confirm the efficacy of the microwave irradiation pretreatment. The pretreatment promotes a synchronization effect to accelerate the particlesâ€™ agitation, and this results in the generation of internal heat. More interestingly, this method of heat generation guarantees a uniform distribution and minimal loss of energy [
