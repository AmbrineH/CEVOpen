<p class="p">A Micrometric 3Flex Version 1.02 model instrument was used to examine the pore size distributions and the sorbent-specific surface areas (S
 <sub class="sub">BET</sub>) based on isotherm of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> adsorption at 77 K. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a,b present the incremental distributions of pore volume (P
 <sub class="sub">v</sub>) with respect to the pore width of the non-pretreated and the microwaved pre-treated CSAC, respectively. As pointed out in the figures, a significant increase in pore volume was noticed after the microwave irradiation pretreatment. The indicating mark ‘A’ on the vertical axis of the figures signifies a comparative P
 <sub class="sub">v</sub> of both non-pretreated and pretreated CSAC, and the magnitude was 0.030 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/g and 0.056 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/g, respectively. Also, the index ‘B’ on the horizontal axis emphasised that more pores have been created after the microwave irradiation treatment, and this explained the increased P
 <sub class="sub">v</sub>. Therefore, the additional pores generated and widening of the initial pores accounted for the significant increase in the P
 <sub class="sub">v</sub>, (
