 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a, a flat surface morphology with fewer cracks was observed at the 3000× magnification. The surface cracks and pore formation are very important physical characteristics for a good adsorption process [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b. From this figure, several cracks were observed on the surface, and the modification in the morphology might be presumed to be due to the microwave pretreatment [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. According to the previous studies, activated carbon with adequate grainy surface is characterized by a wider ranges of pores sizes, availability of more active sites and larger BET surface area. These features expedite the adsorption mechanism, and also improve the capacity of the adsorbate removal per unit of the sorbent [

 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Jalani et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] reported that rapid adsorption mechanism is usually observed at the beginning of the adsorption treatment due to the availability of more bare pores and active sites. This process could lead to the formation of nebulous appearance due to the deposited adsorbate [
