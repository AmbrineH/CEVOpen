<p class="p">The detailed analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the results for colour removal by adsorption under variable treatment conditions of pH (A), dosage (B) and contact time (C) is presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02200-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The analysis has a modal F-value of 13.97, which infer a significant model. In accordance with the analysis: the factors B, B
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and AC were significant in the regression model for the colour removal with F-value of 89.06, 27.73 and 8.28, respectively (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02200-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Based on the magnitude of the F-value, B has the most significant effect on the colour adsorption, followed by the quadratic term B
