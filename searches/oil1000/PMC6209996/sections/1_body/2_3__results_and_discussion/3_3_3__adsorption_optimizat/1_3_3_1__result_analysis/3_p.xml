<p class="p">It is worth mentioning that the coefficients associated with the factors in the regression model (Equation (10)) denote the effect, while the ascribed positive or negative signs shows its synergistic or antagonistic influences on the colour adsorption, respectively [

From this figure, both the actual and predicted values have a good correlation and the error of deviation between the diagonal line and data points (actual and predicted values) all expressed strong agreement. Therefore, the regression models can be used to navigate the designed space.
