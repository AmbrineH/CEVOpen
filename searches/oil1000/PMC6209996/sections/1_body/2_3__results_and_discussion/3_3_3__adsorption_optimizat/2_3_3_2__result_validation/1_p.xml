<p class="p">Furthermore, the recommended optimal treatment conditions by the software (Design Expert 10.0.0) based on the set criteria were used to validate the regression model obtained. Basically, the optimization criteria applied in this study was to maximize colour removal and the pH (A) value to neutral range, while the sorbent dosage (B), and contact time (C) were minimised. Based on these criteria, the first five (5) experimental solutions suggested by the model were selected and verified in the lab to substantiate the model prediction, the results were presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02200-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. The average values of the predicted and experimental colour removal are also shown in the table. The average experimental actual value for the colour removal efficiency was 96.292, and it is in close conformity with the model predicted values of 95.855 with the insignificant disparity of 0.4372.
