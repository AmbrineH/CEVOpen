 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a presents the surface response of the effect of CSAC dosage (B) on colour removal. It is obvious that at a lower dosage, the colour removal was low. On the contrary, higher colour removal was observed at the greater dosage, this might be due to the extra availability of active sites for complete adsorption, as reported earlier. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b also shows the combined effect of A and C, it was noticed that the two factors exert a mutual reciprocal influence on the colour removal. That is, longer contact time (C) and lower pH (A) favours efficient colour adsorption. The observations concur with the previous studies reported [
