<p class="p">During the contact time between 10 to 30 min, the process of colour adsorption was rapid but became slow at the contact time was extendedf. The faster adsorption at the beginning of the treatment might be due to the prominence of active sites but became sluggish as the sites got filled with the adsorbate [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The recorded low colour removal percentage at shorter contact times could be due to the inadequacy of the interaction period for complete adsorption, while, at longer contact times, the available active sites have sufficient time to entrap all the adsorbate, thus better colour removal percentage is attained. On the whole, the active pores gradually got filled with adsorbate (colour pigments ions) until the point of saturation, where the adsorption and desorption rate is equal [
