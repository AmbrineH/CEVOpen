<p class="p">It is an established fact that lower pH has a strong positive effect on colour adsorption [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Nonetheless, the impact of the discharged treated acidic wastewater could directly hamper the aquatic habitat. In view of this, the adsorption studies using the pretreated CSAC were conducted within the acceptable pH range of 6 to 7. The other two factors considered are dosage and contact time, and they were maintained at 3.208 g and 35 min, respectively. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, it can be observed that the percentage of colour removal increases with a decrease in pH. The highest colour removal of 98.46% was obtained at pH 6 but decreased to 95.69% as the pH increases to 7. Basically, the colour pigments in POME such as the phenolic, pectin and lignin, dissociate to generate negatively charged radicals in the acidic solution [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. On the other hand, the acidic media favours the oxidation of the pretreated CSAC to acquire positive charges on the surface. This resulted in electrostatic attraction between the positively charged carbon sites (pretreated CSAC) and the ions of the adsorbate [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This inference is in agreement with the previous studies [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Mohammed [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] varied the pH between 2 to 12, and the author observed that the percentage of colour removal increases with a decrease in pH. Similarly, Gupta et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] and Sia et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] reported a comparable study, they also substantiated that lower pH promotes efficient adsorption process. More so, the pH effect is also valid in the adsorption of chromium from the dye, and that pH less than 5 favours efficient removal of the heavy metal [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Furthermore, Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] investigated the effect of pH (2 to 9) on Ni(II) reduction using carbon-based nanotube and they concluded that the adsorption capacity decreases with increase in pH. In overall, it can be deduced that as the pH increases, the positivity of the CSAC reduces, thus the electrostatic attraction between the sorbent and adsorbate diminishes.
