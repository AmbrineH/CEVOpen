<p class="p">The pretreated CSAC dosage was varied between 2 to 6 g and an equal volume of 100 mL of the POME samples was used throughout the experiments. The pH and contact time were fixed at 7 and 35 min, respectively. It was observed that the percentage of colour removal increases as the dosage increases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The highest colour removal percentage of 99.32% was obtained at 6 g CSAC dosage. The higher performance observed with the greater dosages could be attributed to the availability of more active sites for complete adsorption of the colour pigments [

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. This shows that greater dosage provides higher adsorption capacity for efficient colour removal. Noticeably, at the dosage of 4.7 to 6 g, the percentage of colour removal remains relatively constant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). This denotes that the adsorption equilibrium has been reached within this range of the dosage. Hence, a further increase in dosage is insignificant for the colour removal.
