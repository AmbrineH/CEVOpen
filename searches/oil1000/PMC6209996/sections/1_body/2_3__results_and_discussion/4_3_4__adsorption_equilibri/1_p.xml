<p class="p">The adsorption capacity of the modified CSAC for colour removal from POME was investigated at a variable initial concentration of 450 to 2025 ADMI. The concentrations were varied using dilution factors by adding the appropriate amount of distilled water. Essentially, the experiments were conducted at 27 °C for a period of 100 min to ascertain the equilibrium adsorption for each of the treatment. The obtained results of the equilibrium experiments are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02200-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>. It was observed that a contact time between 10 to 30 min is adequate for the 450–770 ADMI initial concentration to attain equilibrium adsorption while a longer time is required for a higher concentration. The samples with an initial colour concentration of 1500–2025 ADMI reached equilibrium adsorptions after 40–60 min of contact time. Conspicuously, the adsorption process proceeds very rapid at the beginning but became slower after a certain period of time (30 min), (

Immediately after 40 min of contact time, the rates of colour removal for all the observed concentrations were relatively steady. At this point, a dynamic equilibrium has established and no further significant removal of colour [

This shows that the magnitude of the removal percentage depends on the initial colour concentration of the POME sample. This might be due to the rapid collision between the adsorbate and the sorbents as the concentration increases [
