<p class="p">The colour compounds (phenolic, carotene, lignin and pectin) in palm oil mill effluent (POME) are carcinogenic and difficult to degrade, due to their benzene and aromatic structure [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In addition to this crucial challenge in wastewater management, the continuous discharge of such coloured effluents reduces the solar refraction intensity in a water body, thus reducing photosynthetic activities of the plankton present [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. This effect could lead to total distortion of the environmental and aquatic ecosystem. In an effort to check these hazardous consequences on the environment, several effluent remediation techniques have been employed such as coagulation [
