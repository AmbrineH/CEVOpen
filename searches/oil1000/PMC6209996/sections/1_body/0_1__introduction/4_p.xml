<p class="p">In this regards, this study focused on modifying the morphology of the coconut shell biosorbent using microwave irradiation to enhance the specific surface area and pore volume to improve the colour adsorption capacity within the acceptable range of pH (6 to 7). Technically, microwave irradiation induces interior heating as a result of the dipole rotation and ionic conduction of the char particles under the application of a high-frequency voltage [

Afterwards, the pretreated and modified CSAC and the precursor were characterized and compared using scanned electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Furthermore, adsorption performance of the microwave pretreated sorbent was studied and optimized using response surface method (RSM) under varied pH, sorbent dosage and contact time conditions. Then, the equilibrium data obtained were fixed into the Freundlich and Langmuir Isotherms models to examine the adsorbent and adsorbate interaction.
