<p class="p">Many agricultural bio-materials have been used as a precursor for preparing biosorbents. The most common ones include palm kernel shell [

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], coconut shell [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], corn stalk [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], animal bones [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and shells [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The activated carbons produced from the various precursors present distinct adsorption performance, which can be attributed to their activation procedures, the confined carbon density and the structural matrix of the precursors [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Specifically, coconut shell is readily available, highly carbonaceous and structurally stable [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. A report has also shown that coconut shell contains a balanced composition of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose, which are all carbon-based molecules [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Furthermore, such a constitution ensures the efficacy of the carbonation and activation process to generate activated carbon (AC) with a large specific surface area, adsorptive functional groups (such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, etc.), and availability of active sites that favours the adsorption mechanism [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. To recap, the application of coconut shell activated carbon appears to be one of the cheapest, reliable and effective physicochemical methods for POME treatment [
