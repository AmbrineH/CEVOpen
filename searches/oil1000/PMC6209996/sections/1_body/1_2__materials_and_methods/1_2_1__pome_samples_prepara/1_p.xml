<p class="p">About 50 litres of POME sample was collected from the final discharge outlet of a nearby palm oil milling company at Selangor, Malaysia. The company uses a ponding and facultative treatment method which comprises five ponds with different capacities and distinct retention periods. Degradation of the raw POME takes place sequentially through the ponds to the final discharge outlet, where the POME sample was taken and stored in a VC500 chiller at 4 Â°C prior to the experimental usage. This procedure was observed to reduce deterioration of chemical and biological properties of the POME sample before the experiment.</p>
