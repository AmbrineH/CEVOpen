<p class="p">Physically activated powdered coconut shell bio-sorbent (CSAC) was procured from Merck KGaA (Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia) and washed vigorously with distilled water to eliminate all impurities. The washing continues till a neutral pH was assumed and then the material was oven dried at 110 °C for a period of 12 h. Then, the microwave reactor was set up to establish a required temperature of 900 °C [
