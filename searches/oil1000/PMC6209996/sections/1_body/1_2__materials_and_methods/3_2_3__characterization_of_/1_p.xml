<p class="p">The microwave pre-treated and non-pretreated CSAC were characterized using SEM (Model: JIB-4700F; Joel, Peabody MA 01960, USA), EDX (Model: X-123; AMPTEK, DeAngelo Drive Bedford, MA 01730, USA) and BET (Model: 3Flex Version 1.02; Micrometrics, Norcross, GA 30093-2901, USA) analysers. SEM tests were conducted to examine the surface morphology of the adsorbents at 3000Ã— magnification. EDX tests examined the elemental composition of the pretreated and non-pretreated absorbents. The BET surface area and pore volume of the two sorbents were measured based on N
