   <sub class="sub">2</sub>. On the axes, Δμ
   <sub class="sub">S</sub> and Δμ
   <sub class="sub">H</sub> designate the entropic parts of the chemical potentials of S and H atoms in the gas phase, respectively. These are directly related to the temperature, the H
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>S pressure, and the H
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> pressure (see Methods section). The experimental conditions during catalyst preparation, in 1 bar hydrogen (assuming 1 ppm H
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>S contamination), and during HDS (naïve approximation) are indicated in blue. The ball models represent side views of the structures present in the phase diagram. Note that the edges are periodic in the left-right direction
