 <p> Reaction network for CH 3SH desulfurization on MoS 2/Au(111). The activation free energy barriers (ΔG a) indicated in the arrows were calculated based on the experimental conditions (P CH3SH = 0.1 bar, P H2S = ~0.001 bar, P H2 = 0.9 bar, 250 °C). The abundances of intermediates in steady state conditions and in an equilibrium where the C–S bond breaking step is disabled are designated by ss and eq, respectively. The steady state concentrations were derived using transition state theory and rate equation modeling (see Methods section). MT corresponds to methane thiol </p>
