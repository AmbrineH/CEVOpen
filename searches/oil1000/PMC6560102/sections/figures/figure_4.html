 <p> Thermodynamically preferred structure under the experimental desulfurization conditions (P CH3SH = 0.1 bar, P H2S = ~0.001 bar, P H2 = 0.9 bar, 250 °C). a Ball model. b Simulated STM image for U s = −0.3 V, using an electron density contour value of 1 × 10 −6 AU. c Simulated STM image taking into account thermal averaging due to diffusion, adsorption and desorption. The green grid highlights the registry shift of the edge atoms with respect to the basal plane S atoms, which was also observed in the experiment </p>
