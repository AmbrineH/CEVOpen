 <p> Ab initio thermodynamics phase diagram of the MoS 2 edge structures in H 2/H 2S mixtures for Au-supported MoS 2. On the axes, Δμ S and Δμ H designate the entropic parts of the chemical potentials of S and H atoms in the gas phase, respectively. These are directly related to the temperature, the H 2S pressure, and the H 2 pressure (see Methods section). The experimental conditions during catalyst preparation, in 1 bar hydrogen (assuming 1 ppm H 2S contamination), and during HDS (naïve approximation) are indicated in blue. The ball models represent side views of the structures present in the phase diagram. Note that the edges are periodic in the left-right direction </p>
