 <p> MoS 2 edge structure in various gas environments. The bottom panels ( d, e, f) show the original images, which were differentiated (in the fast scanning direction) to highlight the atomic contrast. The top panels ( a, b, c) depict the averaged edge unit cell obtained from the bottom panels ( d, e, f). The ball models represent the 100%S and 50%S structures that could directly be identified for ( a) and ( b), respectively, from comparison to simulated STM images (see Supplementary Figs.  1 and 2). Blue: Mo, yellow: S. a, d Catalyst after preparation in 2 × 10 −6 mbar H 2S at 450 °C, imaged in UHV at room temperature. 6.6 × 6.6 nm 2 , U bias = −0.3 V, I t = 560 pA. b, e Catalyst imaged in 1 bar H 2 at 50 °C. 6.6 × 6.6 nm 2 , U bias = −0.3 V, I t = 630 pA. c, f Catalyst during the desulfurization of CH 3SH in 1 bar 1:9 CH 3SH/H 2 at 250 °C. 8 × 8 nm 2 , U bias = −0.3 V, I t = 400 pA </p>
