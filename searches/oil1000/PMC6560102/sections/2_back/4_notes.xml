 <title class="title">Data availability</title>
 <p class="p">The data that support the findings in this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. The STM images shown in the paper, the total energies of the DFT of all considered edge structures (with and without Au support), and gas phase molecules and the local density of state (summed between 0 eV and −0.3 eV vs. the Fermi level) are provided as a Source Data file. Only commercially available software was used for the analysis and representation of data.</p>
