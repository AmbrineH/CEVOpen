<p id="Par30" class="p">In summary, we have studied the catalytically active edge structure of MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles on Au(111) in mixtures of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S, and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH at temperatures up to 250 °C using a dedicated high-pressure scanning tunneling microscope. In hydrogen, trace amounts of sulfur in the feed are sufficient to maintain a sulfur coverage of 1 edge S atom per edge Mo atom. Surprisingly, the edge is reduced during the hydrodesulfurization of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH to accommodate CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption. Due to the slow C–S bond scission on our model catalyst, the system remains close to an equilibrium state. However, our theoretical analysis indicates that small changes in the reaction rate or the reaction mechanism, which could originate from support effects or from the presence of different hydrocarbons, can have a major influence on the average MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edge structure. In particular, for highly active MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> catalysts one may expect that sulfur deposition by the conversion of organosulfur compounds increases the edge S coverage under hydrodesulfurization conditions, rather than to decrease it, as was found here. Hence, we conclude that the prevalent structure of the active sites during hydrodesulfurization catalysis on MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> likely depends both on the precise type of catalyst and the nature of the feedstock.
