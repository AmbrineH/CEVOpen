<p id="Par26" class="p">Although highly simplified, this model provides some insight into the effect of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH conversion on the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edge structure. When the conversion faces a high barrier, rate constant k
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> will be low. In such a case, the edge structure should be close to the equilibrium of Eq.Â

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH conversion would be lower than the H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S adsorption/desorption barriers, one should expect that adsorbed CH
