 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows that the C–S bond breaking barriers are slightly higher than the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S desorption barriers. Because the rate constants have an exponential dependence on the energy barrier, this translates into orders of magnitude difference in rate. Indeed, when we quantify the abundances of all reaction intermediates (see “Methods” section), we still find an 80.6% abundance of the 38%S-CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH edge state, compared with 80.7% under equilibrium conditions. Hence, it appears that the structure observed in our HDS experiment is the 38%S-CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH edge state.
