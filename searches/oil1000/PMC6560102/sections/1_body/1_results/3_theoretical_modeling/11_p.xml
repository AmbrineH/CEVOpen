<p id="Par29" class="p">A second mechanism that steers the edge structure out of equilibrium is the deposition of sulfur via C–S bond scission. Although this appears to have only a minor effect in our experiment, subtle changes in the barrier for C–S bond breaking can have major consequences for the average edge structure. For instance, if the C–S barrier in the network in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> were lowered by 0.3 eV, the 63%S-50%H structure would become dominant. Hence, support effects, the presence of defects such as corner sites, and the nature of the hydrocarbons that are desulfurized can all cause large variations in the average structure of MoS
