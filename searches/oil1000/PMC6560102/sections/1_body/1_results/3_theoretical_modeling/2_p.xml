<p id="Par20" class="p">The trends of the sulfur and hydrogen coverages in various gas environments can be understood based on the variation in adsorption strength per H or S atom of the various structures. Generally, one expects the adsorption strength per S or H atom to decrease at higher S or H coverage. Hence, higher-coverage structures require a higher chemical potential in order to form. This trend is indeed observed in the phase diagram. However, the 75%S and 88%S structures do not appear. In this coverage range, the registry of the S edge atoms changes with respect to the S atoms on the basal plane, leading to unstable structures with strained bonds. For the hydrogenated phases, 63%S-x%H shows a remarkably large range of stability. An explanation for this comes from the comparison of the 50%S and 63%S structures. For the 50%S case, hydrogen adsorption induces buckling of the edge S atoms (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), implying the presence of compressive stress. The buckling disappears upon the adsorption of a sulfur atom (yielding the 63%S-50%H structure, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), implying a stabilizing stress relief. For the small particles used in HDS, corner sites may provide similar stress relief. It is therefore not a priori clear whether the 63%S-x%H structures are similarly stable in such more realistic catalysts.
