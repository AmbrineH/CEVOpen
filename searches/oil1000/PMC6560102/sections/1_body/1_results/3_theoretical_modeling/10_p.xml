<p id="Par28" class="p">In a more general view, our theoretical analysis identifies two mechanisms that can steer the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edge structure away from its equilibrium with H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S during the HDS reaction. First, the adsorption of organic molecules may favor different edge S and H coverages. In our experiments, this leads to the counterintuitive observation that the edge S content is reduced due to CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption: the 63%S-50%H structure is favored in the absence of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption, whereas the 38%S-25%CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH structure is the most stable one when we do take CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption into account. This effect is likely also present for other industrially important reaction intermediates such as reduced thiophenes, which adsorb even stronger than CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH
