<p id="Par22" class="p">To represent the hydrodesulfurization experiment in the phase diagram, we need to assume that the gas environment can be described solely in terms of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> chemical potentials. This would be the case if the adsorption of hydrocarbons, e.g., CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH, is ignored and the overall HDS reaction is either completely equilibrated or slow with respect to the reactions of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S with the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edges. From mass spectroscopic product analysis, we know that in our case the conversion of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH is low due to the extremely low number of active sites on our planar model catalyst. Even at an extremely high turnover frequency of 1000 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> per site, only ~1 mbar H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S would be generated. If we assume this upper limit and ignore CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption, the chemical potential of sulfur in our HDS experiment is determined by the temperature (250 °C), the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S pressure (~0.001 bar) and the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pressure (0.9 bar), as indicated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. This would lead to a 63%S-50%H structure, which has a slightly higher S coverage than the 50%S-50%H structure predicted in earlier studies for these conditions

 </sup>. It should be clear however that the 100%S structure is not a likely candidate for the structure we observe in STM under reaction conditions.
