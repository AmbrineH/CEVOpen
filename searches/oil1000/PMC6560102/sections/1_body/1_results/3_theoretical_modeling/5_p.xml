<p id="Par23" class="p">To investigate the possibility of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption structures, we calculated the CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption energy for several edge S and H coverages on Au-supported MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). While CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH can bind in all cases, only the 38%S-25%CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH structure in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> is thermodynamically more stable (ΔG
 <sub class="sub">form</sub> = −0.08 eV) than the clean 63%S-50%H structure under our reaction conditions (P
 <sub class="sub">CH3SH = </sub>0.1 bar, P
 <sub class="sub">H2S</sub> = ~0.001 bar, P
 <sub class="sub">H2</sub> = 0.9 bar, 250 °C). Hence, if H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S, and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH would equilibrate with our model catalyst, i.e., if the HDS reaction would be slow enough not to affect this thermodynamic equilibrium, the 38%S-25%CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH structure should prevail. For H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S pressures lower than the upper limit of 1 mbar, the preference for the 38%S-25%CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH structure is further increased. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> shows an STM simulation of the 38%S-25%CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH structure. The irregular appearance of the edge structure will be time-averaged in the STM images at 250 °C, because of the fast adsorption/desorption kinetics of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH (free energy barriers of 0.51 eV and 0.87 eV, respectively). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>, we have taken this effect into account by averaging the local density of states over the four edge positions. Clearly, the averaged edge protrusions are out of registry with respect to the basal plane S atoms, in agreement with the experimental observations.
