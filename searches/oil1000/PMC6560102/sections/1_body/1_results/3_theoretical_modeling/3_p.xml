 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="" class="xref">6</xref> (see Methods section), we have placed the experimental conditions in the phase diagram of Au-supported MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. For the freshly prepared particles, we have used an H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S pressure of 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> mbar H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S and a temperature of 300 °C for the calculation, even though imaging was performed in vacuum at room temperature. We chose these conditions because the edge structure is not capable of changing in vacuum at temperatures below 300 °C
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. As expected, the phase diagram indicates the observed 100%S structure to be the most stable under these conditions. For the reduction in 1 bar H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, we assumed an H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S contamination level of 1 ppm. Depending on the temperature, the phase diagram indicates an edge coverage of 38%S to 63%S, with hydrogen adsorption on most structures. Again, this is in good agreement with the time-averaged 50%S-X%H structure observed with STM.
