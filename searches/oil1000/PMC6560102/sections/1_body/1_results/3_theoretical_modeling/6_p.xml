 </sup>. Hence, the reaction should be in a steady state rather than in the static equilibrium discussed in the previous paragraph. To model how this affects the prevalent edge structure, we computed a reaction network linking a set of reaction intermediates on Au-supported MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The catalytic cycles in the network consist of three stages: the conversion of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH to CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, leaving behind a sulfur atom on the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edge, the desorption of this sulfur atom as H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S, and the adsorption of hydrogen. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, it is clear that the conversion of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH is essentially a one-way reaction due to its high energy gain. In contrast, the adsorption/desorption steps of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S, and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH are all reversible.
