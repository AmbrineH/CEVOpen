<p id="Par19" class="p">To enable an unambiguous assignment of the edge structure observed during the hydrodesulfurization of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH, we consider the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the catalytic process using DFT calculations. First, we assess the thermodynamic stability of various edge structures in a gas environment that only consists of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> depicts the most stable edge structure for Au-supported MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as a function of Δμ
 <sub class="sub">S</sub> and Δμ
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>. These quantities are directly related to the temperature, the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S pressure, and the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pressure through Eqs. 
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="" class="xref">6</xref> in the “Methods” section. The phase diagram in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> corroborates the observation that the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edge structure depends on the gas environment, showing large variations in both S and H coverage. A quantitative comparison with earlier work shows an agreement to within 0.15 eV for the relative stability of the 50%S and 100%S structures

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Remarkably however, we find a preference for low-symmetry structures such as 38%S-x%H and 63%S-x%H over a wide range of conditions. These structures were not taken into account in earlier studies and therefore did not show up in the predicted phase diagrams (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for details). We have excluded that the stability of the low-symmetry structures is the result of the Au-MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> interaction (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), which generally favors a higher sulfur coverage, but does not seem to favor the low-symmetry structures in particular. However, we should point out that for a larger unit cell size, an even larger variety of structures may appear in the phase diagram.
