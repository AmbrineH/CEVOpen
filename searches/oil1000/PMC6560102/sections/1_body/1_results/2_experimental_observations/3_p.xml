<p id="Par16" class="p">Our first step towards reaction conditions is to image the model catalyst in high H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> pressure and at high temperatures. Ab initio thermodynamics calculations predict that these conditions should trigger a shape change in the particles to a more hexagonal shape (as opposed to the predominantly triangular shape of the as-prepared particles). However, we did not observe a decrease in the fraction of triangular particles, which we attribute to kinetic limitations. Indeed, shape changes were experimentally only observed at higher temperatures

 </sup>. On the more detailed scale however, we see that the appearance of the atomic structure of the edge sites does change (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>), indicating that the particle edges have been reduced. The registry shift of the edge protrusions with respect to the basal plane atoms that was apparent for the 100%S edge has been removed, while maintaining the periodicity along the edge of one lattice spacing. Note again that some tip asymmetry could not be avoided, resulting in somewhat asymmetrical image sharpness. To prevent misinterpretation, the conclusions from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref> were corroborated using additional data (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). In all cases, we find that the edge protrusions are located precisely in registry (average 2% of a lattice spacing shift measured with respect to the basal plane registry). The structure in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref> was not dependent on temperature within the range from 50 °C to 250 °C probed here. It should be noted however that at elevated temperatures STM may probe a time-averaged structure, which could obscure diffusing S vacancies or adsorbed S and H atoms.
