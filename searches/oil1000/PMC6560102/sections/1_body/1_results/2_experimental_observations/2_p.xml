 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> that the apparent position of the edge atoms in STM deviates from their geometrical position. This is a result of the fact that the electronic states around the Fermi level, which are probed by STM, are mostly located in between the edge atoms (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1a</xref>). To clearly separate the nomenclature for apparent and actual edge atom positions, we refer to the apparent positions of the edge atoms as edge protrusions hereafter. We should also point out that the STM images in Fig.
