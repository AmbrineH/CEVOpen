<p id="Par18" class="p">Having established our ability to observe changes in the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edge structure under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions, we are ready to study our model catalyst in its active form during the desulfurization of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> shows the structure observed in a 1 bar 1:9 CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH/H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mixture at 250 °C. Before imaging, the flow reactor was allowed to stabilize for more than 2 h to ensure a steady-state situation. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> shows that the edge structure under hydrodesulfurization conditions has changed with respect to the structure in pure hydrogen (see also Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref> and see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref> for the alignment procedure of the grid overlay). The observed registry shift of the edge protrusions is similar to that observed for the 100%S-covered edge in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>: on average 20% of a lattice spacing out of registry in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> and 18% in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> and S5. Again, we note that the registry shift is asymmetric with respect to the lattice, which we attribute to asymmetry in the tip apex. Indeed, one can observe that in both Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, c</xref> the resolution on the basal plane atoms is higher for the horizontal direction than for the vertical direction, which explains why the two edge structures show the same asymmetry. Based on the registry of the edge protrusions, one could assign the structure under HDS conditions to an (almost) 100%S-covered edge. An alternative explanation is the formation of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH adsorption structures. Mo carbide formation can be excluded, since our low-temperature, sulfur-rich HDS environment is far away from the conditions for which Mo
