 </sup> identified the resulting edge structure as the 100%S edge, which contains an S dimer on every Mo edge atom. Its appearance in STM images is characterized by a periodicity of one lattice spacing along the edge and by a registry shift of half a lattice spacing in the apparent position of the edge atoms with respect to those on the basal plane. Indeed, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> shows that the apparent location of the edge atoms does not follow the registry of the basal plane atoms, as also confirmed by the non-differentiated image in Supplementary Fig.
