<p id="Par12" class="p">The stability of the model catalyst during HDS depends on the chosen conditions. Like all thiols, CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH readily adsorbs on gold surfaces

 </sup>. However, at the temperature of our catalytic experiments (250 °C), only the (1 × 1) Au lattice is imaged, even in 1 bar CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Nonetheless, the absence of the herringbone reconstruction observed on clean Au(111)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup> indicates that some (dissociated) CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>S is present on the surface. Decomposition of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>S or H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S leads to the formation of a sulfur layer over time (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>), with a structure resembling that observed by Lay et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. The formation of the sulfur overlayer occurred independent on whether MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles were present on the Au(111) substrate or not. As long as H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S is not added to the reactor feed, the overlayer formation requires hours, making it too slow to interfere with the HDS catalysis on the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles through sulfur spillover. However, the encapsulation of the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> particles by the sulfur overlayer on the Au substrate, depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>, could limit the accessibility of the active edge sites. To prevent this, we restricted the duration of our HDS experiments to a few hours, after which a fresh model catalyst was prepared.
