<p id="Par8" class="p">The combination of high pressures of corrosive gases and high temperature provides a challenging environment for STM experiments. To meet this challenge, we have used the ReactorSTM previously developed in our group

 </sup>. At the heart of this system is a 0.5â€‰ml flow reactor containing the STM tip. The reactor walls are defined by a cap placed inside the scan piezo, the catalyst sample, the STM body, and polymer seals in between these elements. Gas capillaries drilled in the STM body provide a connection to a gas supply system that controls the composition, flow, and pressure of the gases in the flow reactor.
