<p id="Par9" class="p">To mimic realistic industrial conditions, the pressure can be raised up to 1 bar, while the sample is heated up to 300 °C using a filament located on the backside of the sample. A key element in the design is that the scan piezo is not in contact with the gases in the reactor. This geometry, in combination with a careful choice of chemically resistant materials (see “Methods” section), allows for the use of highly corrosive gases such as H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S at elevated temperatures. The use of PtIr tips prevents tip degradation during the measurements, albeit that frequent changes in imaging quality cannot be avoided. To combine the high-pressure experiments with more traditional ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface preparation and characterization techniques, the flow reactor can be opened and closed inside a UHV system, which contains among others an ion gun, an evaporation source, and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy apparatus.
