<p id="Par7" class="p">Here, we present direct observations of the active MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> edge structure under reaction conditions. Using a special-purpose high-pressure scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we have obtained atomically resolved images evidencing a mixed hydrocarbon-sulfur edge structure during the desulfurization of CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH on a model catalyst. We explain the observations by comparing the STM images with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, also taking into account the role of the reaction kinetics in determining the active site structure.
