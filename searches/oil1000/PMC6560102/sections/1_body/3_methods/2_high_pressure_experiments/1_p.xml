<p id="Par32" class="p">The employed gases (Westfalen AG), Ar N5.0, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> N5.0, and CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH N2.8 (main impurities dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide) were fed through particle filters before use. Their purity was confirmed using mass spectroscopy. To prevent corrosion, the gas lines were made of Hastelloy C alloy, whereas the reactor consists of PEEK, Zerodur glass, and Kalrez. Measurements on the bare Au(111) surface under HDS conditions confirmed the absence of impurity deposition other than the slow formation of a sulfur overlayer. All gas lines were flushed with argon for at least 30 min prior to each experiment. To start the high-pressure exposure, the reactor was slowly pressurized in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and subsequently heated to the desired temperature. For the HDS experiments, CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>SH was mixed in the reactor feed only after reaching 250 °C. In order to minimize the thermal drift in the microscope, the system was allowed an equilibration period of ~90 min. To cope with the remaining drift, image acquisition times of around 20 s per image were employed and a drift correction was applied (making use of the well-defined 60/120 degree angles in the particles). As the noise level increased under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions, a 3 × 3 pixel averaging was applied for clarity.
