 <sub class="sub">2</sub> unit cell was employed, in the form of a stripe with periodicity in one direction. The stripe contains both an S-type edge and an Mo-type edge. The S-type edge was kept fully covered in all calculations (2 S edge atoms per Mo edge atom). The length of the unit cell was kept at the value optimized for 50%S coverage: 1.248 nm. For the calculations where the gold support was included, the Au(111) surface was modeled by a 2 layer slab with a lattice parameter commensurate with the MoS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> stripe. The S-Mo-S-Au-Au stacking was chosen as A-B-A-B-C, with a S-Au layer spacing of 0.442 nm. The number of k points chosen for sampling the Brillouin zone was 3 throughout.
