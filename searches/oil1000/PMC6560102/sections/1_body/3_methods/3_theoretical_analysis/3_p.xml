<p id="Par35" class="p">Transition states were located as follows: for a chosen reaction coordinate (usually an interatomic distance) total energies were computed for a range of fixed values (while optimizing all other degrees of freedom). For the structure of highest energy a partial hessian was calculated, including atoms at or close to the reaction site. The most negative eigenvalue of this partial hessian was used to locate the saddle point. In most cases the search had to be restarted several times by recomputing the partial hessian on the structure with the smallest gradient found so far. It was checked that the partial hessian of the final structure had precisely one negative eigenvalue.</p>
