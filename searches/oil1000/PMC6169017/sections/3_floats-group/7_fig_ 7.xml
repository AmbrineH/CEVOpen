  <p class="p">Pearson’s correlations coefficients between saccharification yields, probes’ MF and samples porosity. Discs diameter and colour shades display the strength of the correlations. Both positive and negative correlations are presented using the absolute value of the coefficients. Absolute values under 0.1 are not indicated on the corresponding discs. Positive and negative correlations are displayed in green and red, respectively. Asterisks indicate statistically significant coefficients with a
