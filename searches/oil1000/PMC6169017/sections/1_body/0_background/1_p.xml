<p id="Par15" class="p">Lignocellulosic biomass such as dedicated crops or agricultural and wood residues is one of the most abundant yet under-utilised bioresources in the world and offers substantial possibilities to overcome our reliance on fossil carbon resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin contained in the plant cell walls can be depolymerised to produce a large range of compounds such as biofuels, fibres, plastics or chemicals that are currently industrially produced through petrochemical processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, both composition and structural layout of the plant cell walls hamper lignocellulolytic enzymes progression and activity, making biomass recalcitrant to enzymatic hydrolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Pretreatments are mandatory steps prior to saccharification to disorganise the plant cell walls structure, and to improve enzymes access and activity to their substrate, thus optimising the conversion of lignocellulose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Hot water (HW) pretreatment is considered as an environment-friendly pretreatment process which allows removing hemicelluloses that can be extracted as valuable xylo-oligosaccharides. Lignin can undergo depolymerisation and condensation reactions modifying its distribution within the plant cell wall, but the remaining lignin can sometimes impact the enzymatic degradation of cellulose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Ionic liquids (ILs) are promising green solvents allowing the dissolution of lignocellulose in relatively mild conditions, partially removing lignin and making cellulose more amorphous and easier to hydrolyse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Among many ILs used to pretreat biomass samples, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate has shown good abilities in dissolving large biomass particles compared to other imidazolium-based ILs [
