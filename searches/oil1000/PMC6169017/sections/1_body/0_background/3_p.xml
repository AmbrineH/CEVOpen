However, these techniques only give an overview of structural changes that could potentially affect enzymes’ diffusion and binding to their substrate, and do not directly assess enzymes’ dynamics that could be impacted by other features such as interactions with lignin. The use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) techniques can allow measuring enzymes’ behaviour inside the plant cell walls by direct observations of fluorescently labelled enzymes or fluorescent probes. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technique was recently used to assess the diffusion behaviour of dextrans and labelled cellulases in plant cell wall bioinspired assemblies [
