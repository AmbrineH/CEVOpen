<p id="Par18" class="p">Another interesting probes that can be used to study the structure of the plant cell wall are polyethylene glycol (PEG) fluorescent probes. PEG probes are obtained by chemically linking ethylene glycol subunits, allowing the synthesis of a linear polymer of a specific size [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. A fluorescent dye such as a rhodamine dye can then be grafted to one of the terminal hydroxyl groups of the polymer. PEG-rhodamine probes were selected as PEG was demonstrated to bind lignin through hydrophobic interactions, thus preventing unproductive binding of enzymes. PEG, thus, allows an increase in the glucose yield when added to a saccharification reaction medium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. Donaldson et al. measured the interactions between PEG-rhodamine probes and lignin derived from the secondary walls of steam-exploded wood samples chips using CLSM and showed that these interactions were responsible for an increase of the glucose yield when the PEG-rhodamine was added to the saccharification medium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. PEG-rhodamine probes, hence, mimic the non-specific interactions of proteins with lignin while inducing no chemical modification of the cell wall due to the absence of catalytic activity, making them ideal probes to assess enzyme dynamics in cell walls.
