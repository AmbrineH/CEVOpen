 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Lignin content, composition and structure strongly limit biomass deconstruction both by restricting the access to the polysaccharides and by non-productively binding enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Lignin removal from the plant cell wall is likely to increase its global porosity, which also influences enzymes’ diffusion and is possibly directly correlated with biomass initial digestibility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. These factors influence cellulose accessible surface area which is also an important parameter as it governs enzymes binding to substrate [
