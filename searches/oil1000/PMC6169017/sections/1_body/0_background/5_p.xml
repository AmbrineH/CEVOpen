<p id="Par19" class="p">In this study, we have used CLSM to assess the dynamic behaviour of rhodamine-labelled PEG probes in untreated and pretreated poplar fragments, to explore lignocellulose accessibility. First, the effect of the different pretreatments on poplar fragments’ porosity and enzymatic hydrolysis was measured. Then, hydrolysed poplar fragments were collected at different time points during the saccharification, thoroughly washed and incubated with PEG-rhodamine probes of different sizes so that their composition and accessibility measured by FRAP were assayed over time. The influence of the pretreatments, the probes’ size and the porosity was calculated to determine which parameter influences enzyme dynamics during the saccharification.</p>
