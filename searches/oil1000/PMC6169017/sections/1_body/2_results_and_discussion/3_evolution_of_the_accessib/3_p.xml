<p id="Par43" class="p">The recovery curves of the probes were very similar in all untreated samples, with the only exception of the 1.3-nm probes whose recovery was more important after 96 h of hydrolysis. In comparison, both HW and IL pretreatments induced an enhancement of fluorescence recovery for all probes, but fluorescence increased more quickly in the early phase of the recovery in HW-pretreated samples, suggesting a faster diffusion of the probes. Probes’ size also had an influence on fluorescence recovery for pretreated samples: the smaller the probe was, the higher the recovery was, with variations essentially depending on pretreatment. Effect of saccharification time was not essential and could only be deciphered for the 1.3-nm probe. It is noteworthy to mention that none of the recovery curves perfectly reached a plateau except the curves related to the diffusion of the 1.3-nm probes in the HW-pretreated samples. Equilibrium between bleached and non-bleached fluorescent probes was not reached yet after 10 min. Indeed, a two-phase diffusion was observed for all probes, with a fast initial recovery followed by a slowed down increase in fluorescence probably caused by interaction with lignin.</p>
