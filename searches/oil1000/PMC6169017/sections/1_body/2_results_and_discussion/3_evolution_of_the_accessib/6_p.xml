<p id="Par46" class="p">The evolution of MF was also assessed during the saccharification for the different samples. In untreated samples, all probes displayed a similar MF at the different times of hydrolysis, apart from the 1.3-nm probe whose MF increased from 32% at 0 h and 15 h of saccharification to 47% after 96 h. Similarly, the 1.3-nm probe only displayed a significantly different MF after 96 h of hydrolysis (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.042). The same trend was observed for the 3.0-nm probe in both pretreated samples, whereas no significant evolution of the MF was measured for the 1.7-nm probe. Surprisingly, the MFs of the 1.3-nm and 1.7-nm probes in the IL-pretreated samples were lower at 15 h compared to their respective measured values at 0 h and 96 h. These results showed the moderate influence of the saccharification time on accessibility, with no positive evolutions, while 30% and 50% of the final glucose concentration was already released after 15 h of hydrolysis for the HW-pretreated and untreated samples, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This emphasises that enzymatically catalysed degradation of plant cell walls’ polysaccharides induced small changes in probes accessibility. Pihlajaniemi et al. observed that porosity was not modified during the saccharification of pretreated wheat straw [

A possible explanation would be that the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses could make room for the remaining lignin to expand, thus partially filling the gap left by the degraded polysaccharides and impeding tested probes and thus enzymes from diffusing more easily.
