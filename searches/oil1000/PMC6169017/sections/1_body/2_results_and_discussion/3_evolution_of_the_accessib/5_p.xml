<p id="Par45" class="p">Both HW and IL pretreatments induced an increase in MF of the different probes, but with different trends. While the MF of the 1.3-nm probe was more important after HW pretreatment than after IL pretreatment, both pretreatments allowed a similar increase in the MF of the 1.7-nm probe. Only the IL pretreatment allowed a significant MF increase (

After pretreatments, a decrease in MF could be observed as the probes’ sizes increased, going from 83% for the 1.3-nm probe to 32% for the 3.0-nm probe in the HW-pretreated samples and from 77% for the 1.3-nm probe to 49% for the 3.0-nm probe in the IL-pretreated samples.
