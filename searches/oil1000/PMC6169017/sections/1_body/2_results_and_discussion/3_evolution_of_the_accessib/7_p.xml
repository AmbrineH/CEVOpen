<p id="Par47" class="p">The evolution of the MF showed that diffusion in poplar cell walls was impacted by the modification in composition and structure induced by the pretreatment, the size of the probes but much less by saccharification time. To quantify the relative importance of each factor on the diffusion of the probes, a full factorial experiment was designed in which MF was considered as a response which depends on three different factors, namely the pretreatment (factor A), the probes’ size (B) and the saccharification time (C). Influence of factors considered alone and in interaction was assessed (Table
