 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-values indicate the contribution of the related factor to the MF: the higher the 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value is, the stronger the influence of the related factor is. As expected, pretreatment had the most important impact, followed by the probes’ size. Both had an 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value at least ten times higher than saccharification time. Considering factor interactions, only the combined influence of pretreatment and probes’ size presented a relatively high 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>-value, which makes sense since these factors have an important influence when considered alone. Overall, modifications induced by the HW and IL pretreatments on both composition and structure of the poplar cell walls were the main factors responsible for changes in probes’ mobility. Consequently, the size of the probes was also important, as it can influence the penetration into some pores depending on their diameter. The lower impact of saccharification time means that the removal of the polysaccharides during enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in minor modifications of the samples composition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and structure compared to the effect of pretreatment. A recent study showed an increase in cellulose accessible surface area of diluted acid-pretreated poplar during the first 8 h of reaction then decreasing back to the initial value after 20 h of reaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. Cellulose-accessible surface partially results from an increase in porosity of the cell wall. However, the fact that probes’ diffusion did not evolve after 15 h of reaction tends to show that porosity was not or only slightly improved during enzymatic hydrolysis.
