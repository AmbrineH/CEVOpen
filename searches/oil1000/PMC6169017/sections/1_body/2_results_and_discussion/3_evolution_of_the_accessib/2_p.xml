 <sub class="sub">H</sub>) of 1.3 ± 0.5, 1.7 ± 0.2 and 3.0 ± 0.2 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). These radius values are in the same range as those obtained using DLS on cellulolytic enzymes from different organisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] and also with the nominal diameter of 5.1 nm which is generally admitted to be representative of the diameter of cellulases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. Accessibility of the three PEG-rhodamine probes was measured by FRAP in the untreated and pretreated samples at the three previously selected saccharification time points (0 h, 15 h and 96 h) (Fig.
