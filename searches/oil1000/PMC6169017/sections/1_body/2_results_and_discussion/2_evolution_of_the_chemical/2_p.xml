HW pretreatment also induced a decrease of the hemicelluloses content from 22% down to 8% which resulted in an increase of the relative amount of lignin (from 24% up to 33%). IL pretreatment only induced a small decrease in hemicelluloses content down to 19% while the lignin content remained unchanged [
