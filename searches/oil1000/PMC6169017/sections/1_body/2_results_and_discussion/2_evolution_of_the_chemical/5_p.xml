<p id="Par40" class="p">HW-pretreated samples showed some differences in the evolution of their composition. The observed glucan content decrease after 96 h of hydrolysis (from 47 to 43%) was less important than that of IL-pretreated samples (from 44 to 33%). Unexpectedly, glucan content was even increased during the first 15 h (from 47 to 54%, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001), because of the reduction of the lignin content during the first 15 h of reaction, from 34 to 30% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.026). Indeed, the HW pretreatment caused a partial condensation of the lignin, which was partially aggregated to form small droplets that could be observed by electron microscopy [

It is likely that this reorganised lignin was removed from the samples as the cell wall polysaccharides, and especially the cellulose, were hydrolysed, causing a decrease of the relative lignin content and an apparent increase in the relative glucan content. This decrease in lignin content during the first 15 h might be the reason why the hydrolysis kinetics of the HW-pretreated samples retained a faster rate than those of untreated and IL-pretreated samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). After 15 h of reaction, the evolution of the chemical composition became similar to what was previously described, with a decrease in glucan content and an increase in relative lignin content (from 30 to 35%,
