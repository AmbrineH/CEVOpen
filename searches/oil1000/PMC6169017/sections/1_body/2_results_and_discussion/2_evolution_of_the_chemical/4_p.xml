<p id="Par39" class="p">Similar observations could be made for the IL-pretreated samples, with the glucan content significantly decreasing only after 15 h (from 44 to 33%), while hemicelluloses content remained unchanged. Interestingly, the relative lignin content remained similar during the first 15 h of reaction (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This removal of lignin during the first 15 h of saccharification could be a consequence of some modifications of the lignin features. Previous analyses showed that the S/G ratio of poplar samples increased after IL pretreatment while the G units content decreased [
