<p id="Par36" class="p">The overall chemical composition of the untreated and pretreated samples was assessed at different time points during the saccharification (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In addition to the initial (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 0 h) and final time points (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 96 h), an intermediary time point at 15 h was selected, as half of the glucose yield of the untreated samples was reached after 15 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The differences in glucose release between the untreated and both pretreated samples also started to become more important at 15 h (Fig.
