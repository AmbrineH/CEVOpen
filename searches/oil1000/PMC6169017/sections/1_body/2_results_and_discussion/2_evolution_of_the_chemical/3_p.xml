After 96 h of saccharification, a decrease in the glucan content was observed (from 41 to 33%) and a smaller reduction of the hemicelluloses content was also quantified. On the contrary, the lignin content kept going up to 33%. This increase revealed that lignin was probably not or little affected by the enzymatic hydrolysis.
