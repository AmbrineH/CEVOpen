<p id="Par51" class="p">Porosity below 30 nm increased after the different pretreatments, reaching 87% and 68% for the HW-pretreated and IL-pretreated samples, respectively. This rise was not due to the pores with a diameter below 5 nm, whose proportions were the only ones to decrease among all the measured ranges (11% and 5% for the HW-pretreated and IL-pretreated samples, respectively). In HW-pretreated samples, all other pore size ranges increased, most notably the pores in the range 10–15 nm (threefold) and 15–20 nm (4.3-fold). In IL-pretreated samples, the increase in the proportion of pores with a diameter comprised between 5 and 15 nm was less important (proportion of 14% and 17% for the untreated and IL-treated samples, respectively). As with the HW-pretreated samples, the highest augmentation was observed for the pores in the range 15–20 nm with an increase by 3.2 times compared to the untreated samples. The most important range measured was the 20–30-nm pores which represented 27% of the overall porosity.</p>
