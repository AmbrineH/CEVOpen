<p id="Par50" class="p">Untreated samples displayed a relatively high proportion of pores with a diameter below 5 nm (13%). The pores ranges comprised between 5 and 20 nm had lower proportion around 6–7% while pores in the range 20–30 nm were the most important representing 16% of the total porosity. Altogether, these pores ranges accounted for 49% of the overall porosity of untreated samples.</p>
