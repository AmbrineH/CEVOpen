<p id="Par52" class="p">The increase in porosity observed after both pretreatments is likely to be at least partially responsible for the increase in glucose release during the saccharification of the pretreated samples. Indeed, saccharification and global porosity followed the same order regarding pretreatment: HW &gt; IL &gt; UNT. More precisely, the most important increase in pores was related to the range 10–20 nm for both pretreatments, indicating their major influence for an effective diffusion of lignocellulolytic enzymes. These results are in agreement with the assumption that a pore diameter of 5–10 nm is too small to allow a significant diffusion of enzymes [

Recently, Hinkle et al. showed by electron tomography that the increase in saccharification efficiency induced by steam-explosion pretreatment of corn stover resulted from an increase in porosity and thus in accessible surface area for enzymes below a threshold of roughly 5–10-nm radius [

An increase in the proportion of nanopores with a diameter in the range 10–100 nm formed between microfibrils during dilute acid and HW pretreatment of samples was considered as the most fundamental barrier to overcome to allow an efficient enzymatic hydrolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Larger pores with diameters over 20 nm might be non-essential for an effective saccharification as their proportion was more important in IL-pretreated samples than in HW-pretreated samples.
