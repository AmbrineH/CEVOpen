<p id="Par49" class="p">To better understand the changes of probes’ mobility observed previously, the porosity of the samples was also investigated since it is likely to influence enzymes’ diffusion in the plant cell walls [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. As enzymatic hydrolysis was found to have a low impact on mobility compared to pretreatment, only the porosity of untreated and pretreated samples before saccharification was analysed. NMR analysis of the relaxation time of water absorbed within the samples was used to determine samples porosity. In comparison to other techniques such as nitrogen adsorption of mercury porosimetry, samples did not require any drying step that might be responsible for a collapsing of the pores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Rather, samples are soaked in water so that the environment is close to that of enzymatic hydrolysis. Although the overall porosity of the samples was measured, only pores with a diameter below 30 nm were taken into account (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), as these are the most likely to influence probes mobility into the plant cell walls based on their size.
