<p id="Par34" class="p">The contrasted effect of the pretreatments on poplar samples was first evidenced by the different sample weight losses of 32% and 9% after HW and IL pretreatments, respectively. Pretreatments efficiency was further investigated by carrying out saccharification experiments. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> displays the kinetic profiles of glucose release over the 96-h enzymatic hydrolysis of both untreated and pretreated poplar samples. Glucose was expressed as a percentage of the initial glucose content of the samples that was 43%, 52% and 46% of dry matter for the untreated, HW- and IL-pretreated poplar samples, respectively.
