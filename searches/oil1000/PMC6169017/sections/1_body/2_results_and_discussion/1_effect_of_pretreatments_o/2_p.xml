<p id="Par35" class="p">Untreated samples showed an increase in glucose release over time progressively slowing down after 6 h. The plateau of the curve was almost reached after 72 h of enzymatic hydrolysis with a final yield of 30% of the initial glucose content. Both HW and IL pretreatment allowed an improvement of the saccharification, but to different extents. Kinetics of HW-pretreated and untreated samples were similar for the first 6 h, but glucose release rate only slowed down after 72 h for the HW-pretreated sample, resulting in a final yield of 60% of the initial glucose content. For IL-pretreated samples, the glucose release during the first 2 h of reaction was around 2.5 times more important than what was observed with the two other samples. The reaction then slowed down and followed a similar trend to that of untreated samples. The final saccharification yield was 40% of the initial glucose content for IL-pretreated samples.</p>
