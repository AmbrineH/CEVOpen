<p id="Par56" class="p">An evolution of the correlations with porosity was observed according to the probes’ size. The best correlations were observed for the 1.3-nm and 1.7-nm probes with the ranges 15–20 nm, and with the range 20–30 nm for the 3.0-nm probe. The fact that probes diffuse better in larger pores as their size increases makes sense. Interestingly, the best correlations were not observed with the porosity range corresponding to probes’ diameter. For porosity to allow a significant enhancement of PEG probes’ diffusion, pores diameter had to be around five times the diameter (or ten times the

 <sub class="sub">H</sub>) of the probes. This might be explained by the interactions of PEG with lignin, meaning that probes are likely to fill in the pores as they get bound to the lignin, hampering the diffusion of other probes if the initial pore diameter is too small.
