<p id="Par57" class="p">Saccharification yield displayed strong significant correlations with MFs of the 1.3-nm and 1.7-nm probes, with coefficients values of 0.82 and 0.68, respectively. No statistically significant correlation was observed between the final glucose yield and MF of the 3.0-nm probe as its diffusion was more important in IL-pretreated samples compared to HW-pretreated samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), whereas the latter sample was the most efficiently hydrolysed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The fact that saccharification yield could not be related to the mobility of all probes showed that enzymatic hydrolysis does not depend solely on enzymes’ diffusion. Saccharification efficiency has been shown to be highly dependent on cellulose accessibility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Increase in pore volumes always leads to an increase in accessible surface area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, for a considered volume, a higher proportion of small pores as observed in the HW-pretreated samples would result in a higher accessible surface than larger pores as the one observed after IL pretreatment. Jeoh et al. demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy techniques that improving porosity may have little or no impact on biomass digestibility unless cellulose is made more accessible to enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. For enzymes’ diffusion and mobility to be correlated, a compromise in pores diameter increase must be obtained: pores have to be large enough to let enzymes go through, but not too large so that accessible surface area remains adequate.
