<p id="Par53" class="p">The MF of PEG-rhodamine probes within the plant cell walls can be impacted by both cell wall’s porosity and interaction with accessible lignin. Considering these features, only porosity was largely shifted by pretreatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), lignin content was only moderately affected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). However, porosity alone could not explain the increased accessibility of the probes: for example, after pretreatment, the MF of the 3.0-nm probe in the IL-pretreated samples was the highest, whereas HW-pretreated samples displayed a higher amount of pores with a diameter below 20 nm. In addition, the diffusion of this probe was the fastest in the HW-pretreated samples at the beginning of the recovery compared to the other samples, as the fluorescence increased more rapidly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The fact that recovery was then slowed down could be related not only to lignin content, but also to lignin structure. NMR and thioacidolysis reaction analyses of the same samples both showed that lignin underwent condensation reaction after HW pretreatment, whereas it was only slightly modified after IL pretreatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. This condensation might be responsible for the less important diffusion of the largest probes in the secondary part of the recovery compared to that in IL-pretreated samples, as studies showed that enzymes are more prone to bind lignin that has underwent condensation reactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. A recent report also showed using confocal microscopy approaches that lignin accessible surface increased while cellulose surface decreased during saccharification of raw poplar samples, making cell wall surface less prone to degradation through the course of enzymatic hydrolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. An increase of lignin accessible surface is likely to favour non-productive interactions of enzymes with lignin. These interactions are thought to occur mainly through hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding, depending on the characteristics of the enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. FRAP experiments could then be designed to better understand the dynamic behaviour of isolated enzymes in plant cell walls, and more especially their interactions with both cellulose and lignin. Overall, the evolution of the probes’ accessibility during saccharification is likely not related to modifications of the lignin content but rather to lignin structural and chemical modifications.
