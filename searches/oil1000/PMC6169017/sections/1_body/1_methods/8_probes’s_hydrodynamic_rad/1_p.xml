<p id="Par28" class="p">Methoxypolyethylene glycol molecules with an average MW of 5, 10 and 20 kDa and labelled with methylrhodamine were purchased from CreativePEGWorks (Chapel Hill, USA). The hydrodynamic radius of the fluorescent probes was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS experiments were carried out using a system equipped with a DU 4007 degasser (UNIFLOWS Co., Japan), a WATERS 717 Plus Autosampler, a WATERS 515 HPLC pump, a WATERS Column Heater Module, a SHODEX SB-805 HQ column (8.0 × 300 mm, exclusion limit: 4000 kDa), a SHODEX SB 803 HQ (8.0 × 300 mm, exclusion limit: 100 kDa), a SHODEX SB-802.5 HQ column (8.0 × 300 mm, exclusion limit: 10 kDa) and a DynaPro NanoStar Dynamic Light Scattering detector (Wyatt, USA) with an infrared laser wavelength of 785.6 nm. DLS experiments were performed on FP solutions at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in 50 mM NaNO
