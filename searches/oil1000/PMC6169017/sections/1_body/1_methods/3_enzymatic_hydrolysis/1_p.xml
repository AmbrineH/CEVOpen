<p id="Par23" class="p">Saccharification experiments were performed using the Cellic 
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> CTec 2, cocktail kindly provided by Novozymes (Denmark), whose activity was determined to be 157 FPU/mL according to the filter paper method using Whatmann no 1 filter paper as standard substrate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. The cellulase cocktail was used in a 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 4.8 containing 0.02% sodium azide with a biomass loading of 2% (w/v) and an enzyme loading of 90 FPU/g of biomass. Experiments were stopped after different saccharification durations (0 h, 15 h and 96 h) and fragments were recovered from the reaction medium and thoroughly washed with deionised water for further analyses. The glucose released in the reaction medium over time was measured by anionic exchange chromatography as previously described [
