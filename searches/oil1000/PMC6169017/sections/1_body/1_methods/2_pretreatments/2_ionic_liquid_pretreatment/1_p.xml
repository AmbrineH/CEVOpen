<p id="Par22" class="p">Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment was performed on biomass fragments using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (Solvionic, France) with a biomass loading of 6% (w/v). Pretreatments were performed using mineralisation bombs equipped with Teflon cups (Parr). Samples were kept at 130 °C for 40 min in an oil bath. The fragments were then cooled down in ice, regenerated in deionised water at 4 °C, filtered using 20 volumes of deionised water and thoroughly washed in deionised water and 50% ethanol to remove any ionic liquid.</p>
