<p id="Par21" class="p">Hot water (HW) pretreatment was performed on biomass fragments using deionised water at a ratio of 1:30 (500 mg of biomass for 15 mL of deionised water). Pretreatments were performed using mineralisation bombs equipped with Teflon cups (Parr). Samples were kept at 180 °C for 60 min in an oil bath. The fragments were then cooled down in ice and thoroughly washed in deionised water and 50% ethanol.</p>
