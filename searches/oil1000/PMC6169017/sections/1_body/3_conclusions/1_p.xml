<p id="Par58" class="p">Confocal microscopy was combined to porosity measurements and chemical analysis to get a better understanding of how porosity and chemical composition impact enzymes’ diffusion and activity within poplar cell walls. Probes’ diffusion depended on their size and was mainly influenced by the changes in the structural and chemical composition of the samples induced by pretreatments. Saccharification caused slight changes in accessibility only after 96 h of reaction in a few cases, which means that the cell wall’s network was not extensively modified during saccharification, probably because of the rearrangement of lignin residues. Lignin, whose relative content was increased during the saccharification, possibly underwent some changes in its spatial conformation impeding probes’ diffusion by filling the gap left by the hydrolysed polysaccharides.</p>
