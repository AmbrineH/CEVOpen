<p id="Par59" class="p">Improvements in porosity allowed a better diffusion of the probes. The best correlations between probes’ mobility and porosity ranges were obtained for pores with a diameter at least five times the size of the probes. Pores in the range 5–20 nm governed saccharification in our samples, as their proportion was strongly correlated with saccharification yield, while bigger pores had a detrimental effect. Overall, to improve saccharification, an increase in pore size is necessary to allow a better accessibility while limiting interaction with lignin but it has to be moderate, probably to maintain a sufficient accessible surface area. The influence of interactions with lignin could be further studied by applying more sophisticated recovery model to fit the FRAP recovery curves that would give more information on both the diffusion and bonding kinetics. Those equations would require a better understanding on the nature and distribution of the binding site [
