<p class="p">According to the previous reports, four isoflavones were simultaneously found in soybean oil, while resveratrol was only in peanut oil. Therefore, four isoflavones and resveratrol could be taken as characteristic markers of soybean oil and peanut oil, respectively [

Meanwhile, sinapic acid was selected as a marker for rapeseed oil as its significant higher content in rapeseed oil than other edible oils. In this study, we investigated whether four isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, daidzin and genistin), sinapic acid and resveratrol could be taken as the chemical markers for soybean oil, rapeseed oil and peanut oil, respectively. Besides, the other aim of this study was to develop a simple method to identify multispecies adulteration in camellia oil by detecting characteristic markers of inexpensive vegetable oils (soybean, peanut and rapeseed oils) simultaneously using SPE-LC-MS/MS.
