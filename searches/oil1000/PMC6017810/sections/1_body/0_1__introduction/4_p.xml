<p class="p">Compared with the detection methods above, the detection of characteristic chemical markers in vegetable oils has attracted increasing attention. Obviously, DNA was the first candidate as a marker of vegetable oils. Previous studies showed that DNA could be a marker for authentication or traceability of extra virgin olive oil [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-00241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Since the concentration of adulterated oil’s DNA would decrease significantly or even disappear after deep refining, it is not precise to detect adulteration by DNA based method. Besides, small-molecule markers were used to detect adulteration. Tocopherols and tocotrienols were proven to be the markers for detecting adulteration of palm and grapeseed oils adulterated in other oils, providing that high amounts of tocopherols and tocotrienols in palm and grapeseed oils can be detected [

Compared with the rapid detection methods, the characteristic chemical marker based adulteration detection method could provide more specific and confirmed conclusions. For an unknown sample, however, an exclusive method should be used to determine whether the adulterant exists or not by detecting the chemical marker of this adulterant. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the simultaneous analytical method of chemical markers in several cheap oils for multispecies adulteration detection.
