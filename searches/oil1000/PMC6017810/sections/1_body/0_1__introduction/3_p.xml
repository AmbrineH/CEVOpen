<p class="p">Various analytical methods were proposed and used to detect adulteration of vegetable oils. Many researchers developed a series of methods for rapid determination of oil adulteration, which depended on magnetic, optical, or electrical signals of entire samples. These methods include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [

The analytical methods above are usually coupled with chemometric methods and applied to the evaluation of the quality of edible vegetable oils. Targeted edible vegetable oils were described by magnetic, optical, or electrical signal to acquire a large number of data samples to construct a prediction model. Meanwhile, other methods were developed based on a set of chemical components. Chromatographic techniques such as GC, capillary electrophoresis (CE) and LC were used to identify adulteration based on the triglyceride (TAG), fatty acids (FAs) and sterols in edible oils [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-00241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-00241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. However, the probability of authenticity of oils could be predicted by chemometric models. In practice, adulteration is deliberately conducted with various types of oils. Therefore, it is one of the biggest challenges to identify multispecies adulteration in expensive oils. Furthermore, model based authentication methods could not provide confirmed results for forensic evidence.
