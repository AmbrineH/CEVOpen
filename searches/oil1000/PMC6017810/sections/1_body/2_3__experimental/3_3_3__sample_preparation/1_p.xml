<p class="p">To ensure the authenticity of the oils used in this study, camellia seeds, soybeans, peanuts and rapeseeds were gathered from supermarkets. They were stored at 20 °C in darkness until use. The oilseeds were put into an oil presser after being shelled one by one. The oil presser was cleaned after treating each sample to avoid cross-contamination. The oils were placed into a 50 mL centrifuge tube with cap respectively and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant liquid was transferred into a brown volumetric flask for reservation. The adulterated camellia oils were prepared by adding soybean, peanut or rapeseed oil squeezed freshly according to quality ratio (m/m). Then, the mixture was vortexed and ultrasonic to obtain a high mixing homogeneity. All of the oil samples were stored in a room at 20 °C before use.</p>
