<p class="p">First, SPE cartridges were sequentially preconditioned with 5 mL methanol and 5 mL n-hexane. One gram of oil sample was accurately weighed into a 10 mL centrifuge tube. Then, the oil was diluted with 8 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane and vortex-shaken for 30 s to ensure well dispersion. The sample solution was loaded to the cartridge by gravity, and, consequently, the solvent went through, leaving target components on the cartridge. Subsequently, the cartridge was washed with 5 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane to remove nonpolar fractions of the oil. Finally, the target compounds remaining on the cartridge were eluted by passing through 2 × 3 mL methanol, which were recovered in a 10 mL centrifuge tube. Then, the elution liquid was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. The residue was dissolved with 0.5 mL methanol and vortex-shaken for 1 min to ensure that the target compounds were dissolved entirely. The final extracts were filtered through 0.45 µm organic filter before being injected into LC-MS/MS.
