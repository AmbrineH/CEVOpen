<p class="p">The mass spectrometer was tuned in both positive- and negative-ionization ESI modes for individual standards. Generally, the signal intensity and signal-to-noise ratio for most compounds in positive-ionization mode were both much greater than in negative-ionization mode. As expected, alcohols and carboxylic acids like sinapic acid and trans-resveratrol performed higher responses in negative-ionization mode. To obtain more sensitive abundance for target compounds, mass spectrometric parameters like the monitoring precursor ion, product ion, tube lens and collision energy were optimized by infusion of each individual analyte (1000 ng/mL in methanol) at 20 ÂµL/min. The specific parameters were displayed in
