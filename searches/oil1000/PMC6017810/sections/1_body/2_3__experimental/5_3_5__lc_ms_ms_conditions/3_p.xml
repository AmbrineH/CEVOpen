<p class="p">Mass spectrometry equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source was performed in negative and positive selected reaction monitoring (SRM) modes. The spray voltage was set to −4.0 kV for negative scan mode and 3.5 kV for positive scan mode. The capillary temperature was 330 °C, sheath gas pressure (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was 35 units, auxiliary gas pressure (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was 5 units, collision gas (Ar) was 1.0 mTorr, and scan time was 0.1 s.
