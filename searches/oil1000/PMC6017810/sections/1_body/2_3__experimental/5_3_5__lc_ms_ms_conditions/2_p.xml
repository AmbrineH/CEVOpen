<p class="p">Chromatographic separation was performed using a C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub> column (Hypersil Gold, 100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 3 µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 30 °C. The oven temperature was set at 30 °C, and gradient elution was performed with a binary solvent system consisting of 0.01% acetic acid in methanol (mobile phase A,

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) and 0.01% acetic acid in water (mobile phase B, 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The gradient elution program was applied as follows: 10% A for 2 min, 10–30% A over 0.5 min, 30–55% A over 2.5 min, 55–70% A over 3 min, 70–85% A over 5 min, and finally returned to the initial condition over 0.5 min and held for 2.5 min to equilibrate the column before the next injection. The total analysis time was 16 min, and the injection volume was 3 µL for a good peak profile.
