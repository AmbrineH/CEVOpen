<p class="p">All standards were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Detailed information was as follows: daidzein (≥98%, synthetic (Sigma)), daidzin (≥95.0% (HPLC), (Sigma)), genistein (synthetic, ≥98% (HPLC), powder (Sigma)), genistin (from Glycine max (soybean), ≥95% (HPLC), (Sigma)), trans-resveratrol (≥99% (HPLC)) and sinapic acid (analytical standard (Sigma-Aldrich)). All standards (10.0 ± 0.1 mg) were accurately weighed into a 10 mL volumetric flask and then separately dissolved with methanol as the stock solutions (1 mg/mL). A series of standard solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solutions with methanol. To ensure constant concentrations of standard solutions, all of the standard solutions were transferred into a brown volumetric flask with screw cap, sealed with parafilm, and then stored in the dark at −20 °C in a refrigerator until use.</p>
