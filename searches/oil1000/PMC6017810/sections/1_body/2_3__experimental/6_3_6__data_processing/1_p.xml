<p class="p">Peak identification was required for accurate qualitative analysis of target compounds. The peaks of oil sample extracts were identified by comparing the retention time (RT) as well as monitoring ion pairs with specific standard solutions. The identification criteria included RT within 0.2 min of the average calibrator RT, presence of two transitions and relative ion intensities (% of base peak) within 20% [

Different levels of standard solutions, which were prepared by diluting the stock solutions with methanol, fitted the standard curve by the relationship between the concentration and peak area. To achieve high sensitivity, the fragments showing the highest abundance were selected as the monitoring ion pairs. Data acquisition and processing were carried out by using the Xcalibur software version 2.0.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
