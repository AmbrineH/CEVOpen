<p class="p">A simple method for detecting several markers in soybean oil, peanut oil and rapeseed oil was applied to discriminate potential adulteration of camellia oil after validation. After analyzing the characteristic markers in authentic camellia oil, we found that most of the markers were absent except trace daidzin. Therefore, the analysis of these markers in camellia oil can be used for identification of the adulterants if there is one or several of them including soybean oil, rapeseed oil and peanut oil. As expected, discrimination of adulteration in camellia oil including single or multispecies adulterants was achieved successfully by a characteristic marker or specific distributions, and the effectiveness of this method was verified. Moreover, compared with the previous studies in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00241-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the developed method might detect multispecies adulteration simultaneously. Hence, the present method may be routinely used for detection of targeted soybean oil, peanut oil and rapeseed oil in camellia oil. In addition, another advantage of this method was that identification of potential adulteration for soybean oil, peanut oil and rapeseed oil could be achieved. However, it could be more complex and unpredictable when various kinds of oils were blended into expensive oil. In addition, for this method, further studies would be necessary to find more markers of other oils. Meanwhile, the distributions of these markers might be different in the same species of oils due to different origins or climates, and therefore high sensitivity of a determination method was needed.
