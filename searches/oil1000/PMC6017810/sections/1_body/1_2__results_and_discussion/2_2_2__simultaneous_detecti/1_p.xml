<p class="p">The detection of multispecies adulteration in camellia oil was conducted as an example in this work. In the beginning, potential target markers of soybean oils, peanut oils and rapeseed oils were determined with the developed method mentioned above. The summarized and detailed quantification results for markers in four kinds of edible oils were presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00241" class="xref">Tables S1 and S2</xref>. As is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00241" class="xref">Table S1</xref>, four isoflavones were simultaneously detected in soybean oils, among which genistein, genistin and daidzein were present only in soybean oils and therefore could be used as chemical markers of soybean oil. Meanwhile, trans-resveratrol was employed to be markers of peanut oils. Although sinapic acid was also detected in rapeseed oils and soybean oils, it is not found in camellia oil and therefore could be taken as a chemical marker for detecting the adulteration of rapeseed or soybean oil. To test the effectiveness of this method, three camellia oils were selected as the original authentic oils. According to the previous studies, adulteration level of 10% was used to evaluate the detection method [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-00241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Therefore, the adulteration level was set to 10%, while quality ratio was used for binary adulteration and ternary adulteration. The unispecies adulteration with peanut oil (a); soybean oil (b) and rapeseed oil (c); bispecies adulteration with peanut oil and soybean oil (d); peanut oil and rapeseed oil (e); soybean oil and rapeseed oil (f); and ternary adulterated with peanut oil, soybean oil and rapeseed oil (g) were prepared, respectively. Then, target markers were detected by the developed method. The contents of markers in these adulterated oils were illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00241-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. As displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00241-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the results suggested that four isoflavones simultaneously appeared only in adulterated oil with soybean oil (b, d, f and g). Trans-Resveratrol could be detected only in adulterated oil with peanut oil. Sinapic acid could be taken as the marker of rapeseed oil because of the specific distribution and significantly higher content in rapeseed oils than other edible oils. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00241-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the contents of sinapic acid in camellia oils adulterated with 10% rapeseed oil ranged from 200 to 300, which was about 100 times higher than that in soybean oil. Therefore, when two or three out of soybean oil, peanut oil and rapeseed oil were added into camellia oil, the distributions of the chemical markers conformed to the principle we described previously. In this way, we could conclude that the oil was adulterated with soybean oil if four isoflavones appeared at the same time. In a similar way, the adulteration with peanut oil or rapeseed oil could be determined if trans-resveratrol or a high content of sinapic acid was detected. Detailed data of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00241-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> was supplied in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00241" class="xref">Table S3</xref>. Besides, the more intuitive result was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00241-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, distinct chromatographic peaks of isoflavones, trans-resveratrol or sinapic acid appeared when camellia oil was adulterated with 10% soybean oil, 10% peanut oil and 10% rapeseed oil.
