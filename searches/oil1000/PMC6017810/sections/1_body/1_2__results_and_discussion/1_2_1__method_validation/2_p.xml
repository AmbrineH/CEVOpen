<p class="p">Accuracy studies were performed to evaluate the method performance, which was estimated from three batches of samples in triplicate, as the previous literature described [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-00241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Accuracy was evaluated by the percentage of the recovery by using the spiked samples at different concentrations. The recovery was calculated by difference values between the blank oil and spiked oil. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00241-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, three levels (10 ng/g, 50 ng/g and 250 ng/g) of the standards were added into peanut oils and the mean recoveries for the target compounds ranged from 79.7% to 113.5%, which could be acceptable for analysis. Besides, the standard deviations (SDs) of the parallel assays were mostly less than 10%, indicating good repeatability for the extraction method. Precisions including within-day variance and between-day variance were evaluated by analyzing the spiked samples at different concentration levels. The intra-day precision expressed by the relative standard deviation (RSD, %) was obtained through the analysis of the same sample for three times under the same condition during a day while the inter-day precision was tested on five consecutive days. As presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-23-00241-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the intra-day precisions for the target compounds ranged from 0.61% to 7.37% while the inter-day precisions ranged from 2.88% to 11.91%, suggesting an acceptable variance for analysis.
