<p class="p">The method was validated using the following parameters: linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), analytical recovery and LOD and LOQ for LC-MS/MS system. Calibration curves were established and evaluated by injecting the standards dissolved in methanol. Calibration curves were prepared at the concentration levels of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 ng/mL for mixed standards. As the previous literature [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-23-00241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] reported, the LOD was calculated as the lower concentration with acceptable chromatography and the presence of all transitions with the signal-to-noise ratio of at least 3, while the LOQ was the lowest concentration that met the LOD criteria with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 10. The results indicated that the LODs and LOQs of the target compounds ranged from 0.05 to 0.16 ng/mL and from 0.06 to 0.53 ng/mL, respectively. The calibration equations of all of the compounds were linear with the correlation coefficient (
