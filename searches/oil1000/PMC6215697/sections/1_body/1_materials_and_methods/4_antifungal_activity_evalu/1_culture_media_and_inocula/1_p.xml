<p class="p">For the antifungal activity assays, three standard strains of yeast fungi of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> were used: 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (CA INCQS 40006) 
 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> (CT INCQS 40042) and 
 <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> (CK INCQS 40095) obtained from the Oswald Cruz Cultures Collection of the National Institute of Quality Control in Health (INCQS). All strains were grown on Sabouraud Dextrose agar (SDA-KASVI) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. From these, suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared in tubes containing 3 ml of sterile solution (0.9% NaCl). The inoculum concentration was standardized according to the McFarland scale, comparing inoculum turbidity with the 0.5 standard on the scale equivalent to 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>/10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells per mL. The potato dextrose agar (PDA, DIFCO) was prepared by diluting it more than that recommended by the manufacturer to make it a depleted medium capable of stimulating yeast to produce hyphae. Agar was added to this diluted medium to obtain a solid medium.
