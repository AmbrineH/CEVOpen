<p class="p">The trials were performed with some modifications according to 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"> Sidrim &amp; Rocha (2003)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mendes Giannini et al. (2013)</xref>. The medium (3 mL) were combined to the tested product, were poured into the slide of the microscope at the respective concentrations, previously homogenized by the agitator. After solidification of the medium, the yeast was seeded with the aid of a 1 µL calibrated loop and two parallel grooves were extracted. The striae were covered with sterile lamellae. Plates were incubated and after 24 h as slides were subsequently observed under a 40 × objective optical microscope. A control for yeast growth (hyphae stimulated by depleting medium) was performed, as well as a control with the conventional antifungal fluconazole for comparative purposes. Tests using DMSO as a control were previously performed (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morais-Braga et al., 2016a</xref>), demonstrating that it does not cause inhibition of hyphae at the concentrations tested.
