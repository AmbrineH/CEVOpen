<p class="p">Seasonality variations such as climatic conditions, water restriction, the presence of predators and soil mineral composition may alter secondary plant metabolism (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Figueiredo et al., 2008</xref>) and, consequently, alter the composition of essential oils throughout the year (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Prins, Vieira &amp; Freitas, 2010</xref>). In addition, some specific constituents that present chiral chemical groups are affected by the luminosity rate (

The isolation of plant essential oils is also influenced beyond taxonomic factors, as well as by the variety of epidermal cellular structures that are responsible for the production and storage of essential oils volatile organic compounds (

Therefore, understanding the seasonal events that alter the quality of the active compounds in the plant is fundamental to support pharmacological studies that contemplate and aim at the formulation of new drugs and direct collection periods in direct commercial plantations of this crop to obtain the oil with greater therapeutic potential.
