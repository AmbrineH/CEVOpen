 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> is a polymorphic fungus that can grow both in the yeast form (ovoid form), elongated ellipsoid cells with constrictions in the septa (pseudohyphae), or as true hyphae of parallel walls, as can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>. The hyphae or pseudohyphae forms are responsible for the infectious process ranging from superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic infections. Transition to the hyphae form can be triggered by increases in temperature to 37  °C, increases in pH, and the addition of inducers (

In this form, the germinating tube and the tip extension can generate strong pressures for tissue penetration due to the secretion of proteases, lipases and other histological enzymes. This is important since hyphae formation is central to another aspect of 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>’s virulence: development of biofilms that is associated with increased resistance to antifungal medications (
