<p class="p">This is the first work that shows the potential modulating activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. salutare</italic> essential oil, so there was no way to compare the results here with respect to the species. Within the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Psidium</italic>, some data exist; however, they are related to extracts.
