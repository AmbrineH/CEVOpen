 <italic class="italic">P. brownianum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. guajava</italic> extracts had their antifungal potential investigated, obtaining favorable results, where they also managed to affect the phenotypic plasticity of

 <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic>, reducing the formation process of hyphae and pseudohyphae as their concentrations were increased (
