<p class="p">The effect of the natural product on morphological transition in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was evaluated by microcultive assay. It can be observed that the essential oil inhibited the formation of hyphae and pseudohyphae at concentrations starting from 512.0 Âµg/mL, resulting in the reduction of fungal virulence (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> demonstrate that the essential oil can inhibit germinative tube formation and reduce hyphae elongation, which can be considered effective against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> dimorphism, thus reducing fungal progression and the spread of infection.
