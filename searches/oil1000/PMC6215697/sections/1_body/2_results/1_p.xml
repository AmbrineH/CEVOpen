<p class="p">In the evaluation of the yield of the essential oil 
 <italic class="italic">Psidium salutare</italic> in the analyzed periods, February (0.73%), May (0.29%) and August (0.15%) show that highest yields coincident with the precipitation periods and dryness in the region, however, it was not possible to obtain a statistically significant correlation. Then, when analyzing the
