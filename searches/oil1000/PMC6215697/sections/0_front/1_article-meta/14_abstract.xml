 <p class="p">Medicinal plants play a crucial role in the search for components that are capable of neutralizing the multiple mechanisms of fungal resistance. 
  <italic class="italic">Psidium salutare</italic> (Kunth) O. Berg is a plant native to Brazil used as both food and traditional medicine to treat diseases and symptoms such as stomach ache and diarrhea, whose symptoms could be related to fungal infections from the genus 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of seasonal variability on the chemical composition of the 
  <italic class="italic">Psidium salutare</italic> essential oil, its antifungal potential and its effect on the 
  <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> morphogenesis. The essential oils were collected in three different seasonal collection periods and isolated by the hydrodistillation process in a modified Clevenger apparatus with identification of the chemical composition determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The antifungal assays were performed against 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains through the broth microdilution method to determine the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). Fungal growth was assessed by optical density reading and the 
  <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> dimorphic effect was evaluated by optical microscopy in microculture chambers. The chemical profile of the essential oils identified 40 substances in the different collection periods with γ-terpinene being the predominant constituent. The antifungal activity revealed an action against the 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">C. krusei</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. tropicalis</italic> strains with an IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> ranging from 345.5 to 2,754.2 µg/mL and a MFC higher than 1,024 µg/mL. When combined with essential oils at sub-inhibitory concentrations (MIC/16), fluconazole had its potentiated effect, i.e. a synergistic effect was observed in the combination of fluconazole with 
  <italic class="italic">P.salutare</italic> oil against all 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> strains; however, for 
  <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, its effect was reinforced by the natural product in all the collection periods. The results show that the 
  <italic class="italic">Psidium salutare</italic> oil affected the dimorphic transition capacity, significantly reducing the formation of hyphae and pseudohyphae in increasing concentrations. The results show that 
  <italic class="italic">P. salutare</italic> oil exhibits a significant antifungal activity against three Candida species and that it can act in synergy with fluconazole. These results support the notion that this plant may have a potential use in pharmaceutical and preservative products.
