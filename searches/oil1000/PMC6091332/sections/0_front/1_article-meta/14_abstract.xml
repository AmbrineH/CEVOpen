  <title class="title">Introduction</title>
  <p class="p"> In traditional medicine, many pharmacological activities have already been ascribed to the genus of
   <italic class="italic"> Teucrium</italic> plant. These include antirheumatic antispasmodic, anthelmintic, diuretic, hypoglycemic, and anticancer effects. The recent investigation aimed to characterize and estimate the chemical composition, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer potentials of the essential oil isolated by the microwave-ultrasonic apparatus from
   <italic class="italic"> Teucrium pruinosum</italic> leaves collected from Palestine.

  <title class="title"> Methods</title>
  <p class="p"> The essential oil (EO) was analyzed by Gas Chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), while its anticancer activity was evaluated against HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells. The ability of
   <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum </italic>EO to inhibit the conversion of Arachidonic Acid (AA) to PGH
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> by ovine COX-1 and human recombinant COX-2 was determined using a COX inhibitor screening assay. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the EO was evaluated on the basis of the scavenging activity with a stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, while Trolox was used as a positive control.

  <title class="title"> Results</title>
  <p class="p"> Forty-four molecules were identified in
   <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum </italic>EO, representing 100% of the total EO. Agarospirol was found to be the most abundant component (45.53%) followed by caryophyllene (19.35%). However, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor assay revealed that
   <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> has potential COX-1 and Cox-2 inhibitory activity with IC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 0.25 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml and 0.5 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Moreover, the
   <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO showed moderate antioxidant capacity with an IC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 16.98±0.84 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml in comparison with the positive control Trolox, which has an antioxidant potential with an IC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 2.09±0.17 
   <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml. In addition, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.625, 7.67, and 3.84 mg/ml of
   <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO treatments inhibited mitochondrial activity (cell viability) significantly and extremely by 90-95%.

  <title class="title"> Conclusion</title>
  <p class="p"> The current study provided data that revealed that the
   <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO could be a suitable candidate for use as a novel anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant medication. Further clinical trials would be required to ensure these effects and to allow the design of suitable pharmaceutical dosage forms from this natural oil.
