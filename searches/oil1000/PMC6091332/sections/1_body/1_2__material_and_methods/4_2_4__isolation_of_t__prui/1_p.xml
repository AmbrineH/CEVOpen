<p class="p">The VO of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> was isolated using the microwave-ultrasonic method as described by Jaradat
 <italic class="italic"> et al</italic>., with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Within the isolation process, the powder suspension was exposed to ultrasound- and microwaves to improve the extraction process. A 1 L round-bottom flask containing 100 g of the dried leaf powder was placed in microwave-ultrasonic apparatus. In this flask, the powder was mixed in 500 ml distilled water. Then, the flask was connected with Clevenger apparatus which was placed in the same apparatus. During the isolation process, the power of the microwave extractor apparatus was adjusted at 1000 W. The isolation process was conducted for 15 min at 100°C and was repeated three times for the same plant sample. The obtained EO was collected into a clean beaker, chemically dried, and stored at 2-8°C. The obtained
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EOs yield average percentage was 1.1% from the dried plant sample.
