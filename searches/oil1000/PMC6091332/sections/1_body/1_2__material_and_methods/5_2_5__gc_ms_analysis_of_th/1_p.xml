<p class="p">The
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> leaves EO was characterized utilizing the GC-MS methods, analyzed by GC/MS using a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 GC gas chromatograph equipped with Perkin Elmer Clarus 560 mass spectrometer. The separation was achieved by Perkin Elmer Elite-5 fused-silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>m). The column temperature was programmed and arranged from 50°C for 5 min to 280°C at 4°C/min. The flow rate of He as a carrier gas was 1 ml/min kept constant for all the chromatographic run. 0.2 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>l neat oil was injected in split mode with a split ratio of 1:50 and at a temperature of 250°C. The sample components were identified by matching their mass spectra with those of the library or those of pure standard components and confirmed by their GC retention times.
