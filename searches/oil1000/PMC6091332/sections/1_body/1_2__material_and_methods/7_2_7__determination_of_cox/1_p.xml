 <sub class="sub">2</sub> by ovine COX-1 and human recombinant COX-2 was determined using a COX inhibitor screening assay with a kit No. 560131 Cayman Chemical, USA. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of AA to PGH2. PGF2
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> produced from PGH2 by reduction with stannous chloride was measured by enzyme immunoassay. This assay is based on the competition between PGs and a PG-acetylcholinesterase conjugate (a PG tracer) for a limited amount of PG antiserum. The amount of PG tracer that is able to bind to the PG antiserum is inversely proportional to the concentration of PGs in the wells since the concentration of the PG tracer is held constant, while PG concentration varies. This antibody-PG complex binds to an anti-IgG antibody previously attached to the well. The plate is washed with a buffer solution and Ellman's reagent, which contains the substrate of acetylcholinesterase, is added to the well. The yellow product of this enzymatic reaction is determined spectrophotometrically in a Microplate reader at 415 nm. The inhibitory assays were performed in the presence of extracts at different concentrations (0.25 and 0.5 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g compound/ml) or of a commercial anti-inflammatory drug such as celecoxib. The anti-inflammatory effect of the test compounds was evaluated by calculating percentage inhibition of PGE2 production. The test compound concentration causing 50% inhibition of PGE2 release (IC
