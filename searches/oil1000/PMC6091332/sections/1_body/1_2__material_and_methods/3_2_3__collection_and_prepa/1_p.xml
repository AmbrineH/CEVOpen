 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> plant leaves were collected in May 2017 from Ramallah (Beitillu) and Tulkarm (Kafr Zibad) regions of Palestine. Taxonomical identifications were established by the pharmacognosist Dr. Nidal Jaradat at the Pharmacognosy Laboratory at An-Najah National University and the voucher specimen code was Pharm-PCT-2416. The plant leaves were washed well and then dried in the shade at controlled temperature (25±2°C) and humidity (55±5 RH). After the drying process, the leaves were grounded well by using a mechanical grinder into a coarse powder and transferred into airtight containers with proper labeling for future use.
