<p class="p">A study conducted by Masuda
 <italic class="italic"> et al</italic>. found that agarospirol had an anticancer effect and this effect mainly associated with apoptosis potentials such as nuclear fragmentation and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, it was reported in this study that agarospirol induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38, prior to the onset of apoptosis. These results suggested that agarospirol induced apoptosis through the JNK signaling pathway. Therefore, agarospirol may represent a novel medicinal drug having indications in the treatment of various types of cancers [
