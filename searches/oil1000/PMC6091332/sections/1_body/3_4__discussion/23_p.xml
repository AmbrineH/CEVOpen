<p class="p">Briefly, the current study identified for the first time the chemical composition of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum </italic>EO from Palestine and the pharmacological screenings showed that the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum </italic>possessed moderate antioxidant capacity with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 16.98±0.84 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml in comparison with the positive control Trolox which has antioxidant potential which had IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 2.09±0.17 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml. In addition, the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> had potential anti-inflammatory activity almost the same as the NSAID drug etodolac, while a 7.67 mg/ml of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO treatment inhibited mitochondrial activity (cell viability) significantly and extremely by 90-95%.
