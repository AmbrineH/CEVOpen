<p class="p">The current investigation is the first to evaluate the chemical constituents of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum </italic>EO, also the first one which investigated the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities of the studied EO employing a variety of in vitro assays. The reported data in the current study showed that the EO of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum </italic>possessed the highest content in alcoholic sesquiterpenoid namely agarospirol. The remarkably high content of agarospirol could be of interest for further phytochemical and biological investigation of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic>, taking into account the fact that agarospirol-rich oils showed marked anticancer activity. In summary, our results indicated that
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO induced apoptosis effect against HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells line and, in addition, has cyclooxygenase inhibitory and antioxidant activities suggesting the possibility that
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO may be a useful anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory drug that could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of commercially available drugs. Further studies are needed to clarify the details of the mechanisms of action for
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO which induced apoptosis.
