It is recognized as swelling, redness, pain, and heat; however, severe inflammation must be decreased to avoid further destruction in the tissues. At this stage, anti-inflammatory agents have used to block the action of phospholipase or cyclooxygenase (cox1/cox2) by steroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [
