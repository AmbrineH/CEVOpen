<p class="p">The enzyme inhibition activity of
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO was carried out using an ELISA kit. The calculated percentage inhibition for the tested compounds is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The results showed that the
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO demonstrated a selective inhibition activity toward COX-2 enzyme. The calculated IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was found to be 0.103 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml. However,
 <italic class="italic"> T. pruinosum</italic> EO also showed inhibition activity toward COX-1 enzyme and the calculated IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> was found to be 0.208 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/ml.
