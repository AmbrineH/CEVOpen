<p class="p">Therefore, the aim of the current experiment was to assess the effect of feeding CLA and MCFA, alone or in combination, in late gestation and lactation to primiparous and multiparous sows on the growth and survival of their progeny. We hypothesized that gilt progeny would benefit further from this feeding strategy due to their lower birth weights and reduced absorption of IgG from colostrum in comparison to sow progeny, with improvements in pre-weaning survival due to increased energy stores around birth and higher concentrations of IgG in colostrum and milk, resulting in improved immunity.</p>
