 <xref rid="animals-09-00062-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. During the lactation period, four primiparous and four multiparous sows were removed from the experiment due to mortality or ill health. Of those sows, any that farrowed prior to removal had their farrowing house entry (BW and P2 backfat depth) and farrowing data (NBA, SB, MU, TB) included in the analysis. Seven primiparous and eight multiparous sows were removed for management and health reasons after weaning; hence, subsequent mating data were not available for these animals. The results of the analysis were similar whether fostered piglets were included or not. Therefore, the results presented herein include the results for these piglets. Piglet sex was not significant (

The number of days from day 107 of gestation to farrowing was used as a covariate in the analysis of dam P2 and BW at weaning, subsequent gestation length, piglet serum IgG concentration, litter weight at day 21, and NW in the experimental litter, as it made a significant (
