<p class="p">Multiparous sows on the CON diet were fatter at entry to the farrowing house than multiparous sows on other diets, whereas primiparous sows on the BOTH diet were fatter compared to primiparous sows on the other diets (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003; 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00062-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Therefore, P2 backfat depth at entry nested within dam parity treatment was tested as a covariate in the analysis for any further parameters. However, it was not significant for any trait (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≥ 0.10) and was therefore not included in any models except for that of the change in P2 backfat depth from entry to weaning. Dam P2 backfat depth at entry was different (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.024) with respect to diet, with primiparous and multiparous sows in the CON treatment fatter than those in the experimental treatments (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00062-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). There was no difference (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.26) in P2 backfat depth at weaning between dietary treatments. The dam parity x diet interaction was significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.004) for change in P2 backfat depth from entry to weaning (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00062-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). However, when the change in P2 backfat depth from entry to weaning was corrected for P2 backfat depth at entry to the farrowing house (nested within dam parity treatment), there was no difference (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≥ 0.05) between dam parities, diets, or their interaction (data not shown).
