<p class="p">Total protein concentration was measured using the Pierce
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby Vic, Australia) after dilution of standards and samples in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby Vic, Australia) to remove any lipid interference, as described by Geale [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Intra- and inter-assay CVs were 2.3% and 5.8%, respectively. Total IgG concentration was determined using a commercial ELISA kit with assays performed in singlicate (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery TX, USA; 1.6% inter-assay CV), and total lactose concentration was analyzed using a commercial colorimetric assay kit with assays performed in singlicate (BioVision; Sapphire Bioscience, Redfern NSW, Australia; 6.7% inter-assay CV).
