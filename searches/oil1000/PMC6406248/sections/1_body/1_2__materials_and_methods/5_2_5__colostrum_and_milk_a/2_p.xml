<p class="p">Total NE content of colostrum was derived using the same equation without the value for protein as per the suggestion of Theil et al. [

Total fat concentration in each whole colostrum and milk sample was measured using a modified version of the method described by Forcato et al. [

Sixty μL of sample was added to 3 mL of chilled ethanol (Ajax Finechem; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby Vic, Australia), shaken, and then frozen at −20 °C for 1 h. The solution was then centrifuged at 13,000×

Ltd., Heidelberg West Vic, Australia) after being left to reach room temperature. The absorbance was then read at 208 nm on a plate reader (Spark®; Tecan Group Ltd. Männedorf, Switzerland). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) for the assay were 1.9% and 10.0%, respectively.
