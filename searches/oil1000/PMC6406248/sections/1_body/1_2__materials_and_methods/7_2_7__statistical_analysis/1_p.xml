<p class="p">Growth and reproductive performance of dams, colostrum and milk composition, litter growth performance (with the dam as the experimental unit), and serum IgG and metabolite concentrations (with an individual piglet as the experimental unit) were analyzed as linear mixed models using the MIXED procedure of SPSS (IBM SPSS, version 24; IBM, Armonk NY, USA). Dam parity (primiparous versus multiparous), diet, and the interaction between the two were used as fixed factors in a 2 × 4 factorial design with other factors and covariates included in the model as necessary. A 2 × 2 factorial design was employed for the analysis of piglet serum FA concentrations (primiparous versus multiparous; CON versus MCFA). For the analysis of piglet serum IgG and metabolite concentrations, sex was fitted as a fixed factor where it made a significant contribution to the model. The number of days from day 107 of gestation to farrowing or to weaning was fitted as a covariate where they made a significant contribution to the model. This was in order to represent the number of days that the experimental diets were fed to the dam before farrowing, which was unbalanced in the study design due to commercial constraints and because farrowing did not always occur on the expected date. Pairwise comparisons between interaction means were made with simple effects analysis within the COMPARE function using SPSS syntax. Mortality data and subsequent mating and farrow rate were analyzed as binomial traits (e.g., lived or died, mated or not, farrowed or not) using chi square (χ
