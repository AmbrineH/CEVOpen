<p class="p">A total of 252 first-cross dams (PrimeGro
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup>, Corowa NSW, Australia) were included in the experiment, including 129 primiparous (parity 1) and 123 multiparous sows (parities 3 and 4). Sows were assigned to one of four dietary treatments (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00062-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), fed from day 107 of gestation (107.3 ± 0.1 days; mean ± SE) and throughout lactation until weaning (27.2 ± 0.1 days of age). Diets consisted of different sources of dietary lipid: (i) 6% tallow, predominantly ruminant (control; CON); (ii) a CLA diet consisting of 2.5% tallow replaced with a commercial CLA product (Lutrell® Pure; BASF, Southbank Vic, Australia; the product contained 20% CLA isomers comprised of 10% c9,t11-18:2 and 10% t10,c12-18:2); (iii) a MCFA diet consisting of 0.1% tallow replaced with a commercial MCFA product (Aromabiotic® Pig; Nuscience, Drongen, Belgium; comprised of 28.1% acetic acid, 0.9% valeric acid, 0.9% caproic acid, 0.4% caprylic acid, 18.5% capric acid, and 16.5% lauric acid); and (iv) a combination (BOTH) that was delivered to sows as equal parts of the CLA and MCFA diets (by weight) such that sows received 0.25% CLA isomers and 0.025% MCFA product in their diet ration in the place of tallow. The diets were all formulated to be isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, and the analyzed composition of the final diets is shown in
