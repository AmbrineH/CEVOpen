<p class="p">Total feed intake was recorded for each sow from farrowing until weaning, and the average daily feed intake (ADFI) in this period was calculated. Dam body weight (BW) and backfat depth measured ultrasonically at the P2 site (6.5 cm from the midline over the last rib) were recorded at entry to the farrowing house. Within 24 h of birth, all live piglets were individually weighed and given a numbered ear tag prior to fostering. Date of birth, number of piglets born alive (NBA), number of stillbirths (SB), number of mummified fetuses (MU), and total piglets born (TB) were recorded for each litter. Piglets were then individually weighed again at day 21 of lactation, and the average daily gain (ADG) in this period for each piglet was calculated. All liveborn piglet mortalities were recorded from birth until weaning, and the number of piglets weaned (NW) was recorded for each litter.</p>
