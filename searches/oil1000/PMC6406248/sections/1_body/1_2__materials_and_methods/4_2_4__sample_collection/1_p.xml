<p class="p">Colostrum samples (approximately 5–10 mL) were manually collected at parturition (within 1 hour of the birth of the first piglet) without the use of oxytocin from a subset of sows that farrowed during the day and could therefore be observed at farrowing (“focal sows”, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 78). Milk samples were manually collected on day 21 of lactation after injection of 1 mL (10 IU) of subcutaneous oxytocin (intra-vulval; Ilium Syntocin®, Troy Laboratories, Glendenning NSW, Australia). Colostrum and milk samples were pooled from the first three anterior glands on either side of the udder. Samples were stored immediately at −20 °C until further analysis. Prior to IgG, protein, and lactose analysis, colostrum and milk samples were defatted by centrifuging at 21,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C. Due to commercial restraints, piglets were unable to be separated from their dams before blood sample collection. Individual blood samples (approximately 1 mL) were collected into Vacutainer® tubes (BD Australia, North Ryde NSW, Australia) from two piglets per focal sow litter (one male and one female, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 144) via jugular venepuncture 3 days after farrowing. Samples were then left to clot for at least 3 h, centrifuged at 6000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min, serum aspirated, and stored at −20 °C until further analysis.
