<p class="p">Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-HBA) concentrations were assayed using a commercial colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical; Sapphire Bioscience, Redfern NSW, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with an intra-assay CV of 2.1% and an inter-assay CV of 16.5%. Total serum glucose concentration was determined using a colorimetric assay (Infinity
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Glucose Reagent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby Vic, Australia) and a calibrator with a reference value of 177 mg/dL glucose as a standard (Data Cal
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup>, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby Vic, Australia), and the absorbance was read at 490 nm. Intra- and inter-assay CVs for the glucose assay were 2.2% and 14.3%, respectively. Serum non-esterified FA (NEFA) concentrations were determined using the NEFA C kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Kawagoe, Japan) as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and intra- and inter-assay CVs were 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Total IgG and protein concentrations in each piglet serum sample were determined using the commercial kits described previously (protein assay intra-assay CV 2.6%; inter-assay CVs 12.6% and 4.6%, respectively). Serum samples from all female progeny in the CON and MCFA dietary treatment groups (
