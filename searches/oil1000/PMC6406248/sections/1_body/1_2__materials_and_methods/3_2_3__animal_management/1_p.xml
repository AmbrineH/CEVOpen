<p class="p">The experiment was carried out under commercial conditions at a large piggery in Corowa, New South Wales, Australia (Rivalea Australia Pty. Ltd.). Primiparous and multiparous sows were group-housed separately in groups of 40 (approximately 2 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/pig) from mating and fed a common gestation diet [averaging 13.1 MJ DE/kg, 12.8% CP, 0.5% available standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys, as fed basis] through to entry to the farrowing house at approximately day 104 (103.9 Â± 2.2 days) of gestation. During this period, animals were fed different allowances in early (weeks 1 to 5; 2.4 kg/d and 2.7 kg/d for primiparous and multiparous sows, respectively), mid (weeks 6 to 13; 2.0 kg/d and 2.2 kg/d, respectively), and late gestation (weeks 14 until entry to the farrowing house; 2.2 kg/d and 2.4 kg/d, respectively). Sows were fed the control (CON) diet regardless of their experimental treatment from entry to the farrowing house until day 107 of gestation. Experimental diets were fed from day 107 of gestation. Sows were given an allowance of 2.5 kg/d from entry to the farrowing house until farrowing, 2.5 kg on the day of farrowing, 3 kg on the first day after farrowing, a maximum of 4 kg on the second day and ad libitum access thereafter until weaning. Cross-fostering was carried out 24 hours after farrowing as per commercial procedures to standardize litters to approximately 10 to 12 piglets depending on the number of functional mammary glands. Piglets were fostered within dietary and parity treatments wherever possible.
