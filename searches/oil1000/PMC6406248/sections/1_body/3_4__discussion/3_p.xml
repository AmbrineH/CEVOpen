<p class="p">Feeding CLA to dams during late gestation and lactation did not increase day three serum IgG concentrations of piglets in the present study. Similar studies that found an improvement in serum IgG of piglets found these differences at weaning [

 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Piglet IgG concentrations were not measured at or after weaning in the current study, and as such, it is unclear whether improvements in immune status may have been gained later in life. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] found an improvement in progeny serum IgG concentration in the first 24 to 26 hours of life, but this was only in piglets from the highest CLA inclusion level treatment (2.25% CLA oil). They also found an increase in colostrum IgG concentrations at only the higher inclusion levels (&gt; 1.5% CLA), whereas we found no difference at 0.5% CLA. This suggests that higher levels of CLA (&gt; 0.5%) may be necessary in order to improve IgG concentrations in primiparous and multiparous sow colostrum and increase piglet serum IgG in the first postnatal days.
