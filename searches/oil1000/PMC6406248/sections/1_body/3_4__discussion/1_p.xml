<p class="p">The current study confirmed that gilt progeny are born lighter and grow slower before weaning compared to progeny born to multiparous sows [

 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Gilt progeny had lower serum IgG concentrations than sow progeny in the current study, as expected from previous findings [
 <xref rid="B15-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. However, colostrum and milk IgG concentrations did not differ between primiparous and multiparous sows in the current study. In fact, primiparous sows tended to have higher IgG concentrations in colostrum, a result in contention with previous work [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Differences between studies may be due to variation in a number of factors, such as timing of colostrum collection [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], udder section sampled [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and multiparous sow parities included in the study [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], as colostrum IgG concentrations have been shown to be very sensitive to such differences in collection methodology. Furthermore, there may be differences in colostrum [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and milk volume [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] between primiparous and multiparous sows, which may impact the concentrations of several components, including IgG.
