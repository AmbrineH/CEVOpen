<p class="p">Conjugated linoleic acid has been shown to have positive immunomodulatory effects on colostrum, milk, and progeny serum IgG concentrations when fed in late gestation and (or) lactation to sows [

 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], and MCFA have been shown to have antibacterial properties and improve gut development and function in the pig [

 <xref rid="B33-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Despite these purported effects, we observed no added benefits to the lactation performance of primiparous sows and their progeny relative to sows and their progeny with CLA or MCFA. Overall, there were only subtle differences between the performance and serum IgG concentration of gilt and sow progeny when their dams were fed the experimental diets. Given the lack of improvements in performance between piglets from primiparous and multiparous sows fed CLA and MCFA separately, it was therefore not surprising that there were no advantages to feeding both ingredients together in the BOTH treatment. It was unfortunate that other immunoglobulins such as IgA and IgM were not measured in the current study, as feeding CLA from day 85 of gestation until farrowing has been shown to improve concentrations of IgA and IgM in sow serum, colostrum, and piglet serum [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Furthermore, dietary MCFA may have immunomodulatory effects, such as stimulating IgA production in response to a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Hence, these mechanisms require further investigation. The microbiome of the sow and (or) the piglets may also have been altered by feeding MCFA, which have been shown to have several probiotic and antibacterial effects in the intestinal lumen of pigs [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. These may have improved progeny health and growth performance after weaning but were unable to be quantified in the current study.
