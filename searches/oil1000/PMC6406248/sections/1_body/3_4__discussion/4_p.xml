<p class="p">Data as to whether CLA increases [

 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] colostrum fat concentration are equivocal. Results from the current study concur with Cordero et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] that there was no effect on colostrum fat concentration, which is also consistent with the studies of Bontempo et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and Schmid et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] that found no effect on milk fat concentration. Other studies report that milk fat was depressed when dams were fed CLA [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,

 <xref rid="B41-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Piglet growth performance was not affected by CLA supplementation in agreement with the previous literature [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] showed that piglet growth performance increased linearly in line with an increase in CLA inclusion level (up to 2.25% CLA oil; total 1.35% CLA isomers), which may indicate that the levels used in the current study were insufficient to noticeably impact piglet performance. This is further evidenced by the observation of increased milk yield and piglet pre-weaning growth rates in studies that fed 1% CLA oil (approximately 0.6% biologically active CLA isomers) or higher [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. This may also be an explanation as to why there were no differences in piglet serum metabolites such as glucose or triglycerides from dams fed CLA in the current study.
