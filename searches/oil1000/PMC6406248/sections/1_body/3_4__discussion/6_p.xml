<p class="p">Medium-chain FA can be found in their triglyceride form (MCT) in coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and cuphea seeds, or manufactured in their free FA form into commercial feed additives [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The antimicrobial effects of MCFA in the intestinal lumen of pigs have been well reported [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Mechanisms may include anionic surfactant function [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], destabilization of bacterial cell walls and membranes by incorporation into the membrane itself and (or) inhibition of bacterial lipase [

 <xref rid="B48-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], initiating cell death via disassociating within the bacterial cell and lowering pH [

 <xref rid="B50-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], or by triggering cell autolysis by activation of bacterial enzymes [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Dietary MCTs have also been shown to stimulate growth hormone (GH) release in pigs, most likely through increased bioactivation of ghrelin [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Moreover, due to their positive effects on energy homeostasis and gut health [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], MCFA may be effective in improving FA metabolism in sows, increasing milk FA content and suckling piglet energy levels as a result [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Our study showed no positive effects of feeding MCFA on progeny performance or serum metabolite profiles, suggesting that the inclusion level in the current study was insufficient to influence the piglet when fed through the dam. The fact that there was no increase in piglet pre-weaning growth performance when their dams were fed the MCFA diet is consistent with previous work in cows [
 <xref rid="B57-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], and is in agreement with the lack of difference in CON and MCFA piglet energetic metabolite profiles. However, when fed as MCT, these FA are known to have a ketogenic effect on the sow and improve blood glucose metabolism [
 <xref rid="B58-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], serum FA profiles [
 <xref rid="B59-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], pre-weaning weight gain of her progeny [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], and pre-weaning survival of light birth weight piglets [
 <xref rid="B60-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. It is more likely (in this case) that the ketones produced by the dam as a result of the breakdown of MCTs are passed to the progeny via the placenta [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Ingredients with high levels of MCTs, such as coconut oil or palm kernel oil, may therefore be a more viable dietary alternative (compared to free FA products) to improve primiparous and multiparous sow and progeny performance. Feeding these additives in late gestation and (or) lactation has been shown to increase pre-weaning survival rates in low birth weight pigs [
 <xref rid="B60-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. However, the use of these products in a commercial setting may be limited by their cost and difficulties with mixing at the feed mill owing to their relatively high viscosity. This has also previously been identified as an issue with CLA oil addition [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-09-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>].
