<p class="p">In conclusion, feeding CLA or MCFA alone or in combination to primiparous and multiparous sows from day 107 of gestation to weaning did not improve colostrum or milk composition, nor did it improve the serum energetic metabolite profile or pre-weaning growth of their piglets. These results suggest that supplementing 0.5% CLA isomers may increase pre-weaning liveborn survival of both gilt and sow progeny while also increasing the number of SB piglets. There were no added benefits of these additives to gilt progeny or to feeding both CLA and MCFA simultaneously. Feeding CLA may be more successful in improving the performance and pre-weaning survival of gilt progeny if fed only from farrowing until weaning, and MCFA may have impacts on intestinal microbiota and hence progeny growth and survival after weaning. Both of these require further investigation.</p>
