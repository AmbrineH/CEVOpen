  <bold class="bold">Context:</bold> Inflammation and cell differentiation lead to a number of severe diseases. In the recent years, various studies focused on the anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity of essential oils (EOs) of numerous plants, including different 
  <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Objective:</bold> The phytochemical composition, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity of EOs from needles and twigs of 
  <italic class="italic">Pinus heldreichii</italic> Christ (Pinaceae) and 
  <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> Griseb., and from needles, twigs and cones of 
  <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> Turra were determined.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Materials and methods:</bold> For separation and identification of the EOs, gas chromatography/flame ion detector (GC/FID) and GC/mass spectrometry were performed. The amount of secreted IL-6 in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage model was quantified (concentration of oils: 0.0001–0.2%, 3 h incubation). Cytotoxicity on the cancer cell lines HeLa, CaCo-2 and MCF-7 were determined using a MTT (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide) assay (concentration of oils: 0.001–0.1%, 24 h incubation).
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Results:</bold> The most prominent members in the oils include: δ-3-carene, α-pinene and linalool-acetate (
  <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic>); α-pinene, β-phellandrene and β-pinene (
  <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic>); limonene, α-pinene and (E)-caryophyllene (
  <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic>). EOs showed significant cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.007 to &gt;0.1%), with a reduction in cell viability with up to 90% at a concentration of 0.1%, and anti-inflammatory activity (IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 0.0008–0.02%) with a reduction of IL-6 secretion with up to 60% at a concentration of 0.01%.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Discussion and conclusion:</bold> The EOs of needles and twigs from 
  <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> as well as of needles, twigs and cones of 
  <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> can be considered as promising agents for anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs.
