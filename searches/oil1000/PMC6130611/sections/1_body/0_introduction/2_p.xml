<p class="p">Inflammatory and oxidative disorders lead to a number of diseases including cancer (Lahlou

 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Several drugs are available as anti-inflammatory (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids) and anticancer agents. Treatment of cancer with chemotherapy and/or radiation is associated with high systemic toxicity and development of drug resistance, resulting in unsuccessful treatment (Buchholz &amp; Gress

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). This led to an increased interest of research in considering plant extracts as potential source for the development of novel alternative anticancer or anti-inflammatory agents (Efferth et al.
