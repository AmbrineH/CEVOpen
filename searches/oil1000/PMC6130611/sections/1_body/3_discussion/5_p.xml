<p class="p">Moreover, the chemical composition of the EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> needles, twigs and cones showed differences to each other. The major compounds of the essential oil in the needles are α-pinene and δ-3-carene (21.3% and 19.3%), which is similar to the 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> essential oil compositions reported by Hajdari et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) [α-pinene (17.0-24.5%), followed by δ-3-carene (15.5-27.9%), germacrene D (4.0-9.9%) and (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (4.3-9.0%)] and Stevanovic et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) [δ-3-carene (23.9%), 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (17.9%)]. The major compounds on twigs EOs were δ-3-carene (28.1%), limonene (19.5%) and β-pinene (11.0%), similar to essential oil compositions reported by Hajdari et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) [3-δ-carene (24.0-51.7%) followed by limonene + β-phellandrene (12.7-24.3%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (4.0-10.9%), β-pinene (2.2-15.4%) and α-pinene (4.5-8.8%)], while in cone EOs the major compounds were (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (20.2%) and δ-3-carene (15.8%). Similar chemical composition was previously reported by Hajdari et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) [δ-3-carene (10.5-31.5%), followed by (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (10.4-27.0%)]. These essential oil compositions are very different to previous studies, which reported α-pinene (33% from 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> in Scotland) and bornyl acetate (11.5% from 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> in Italy) as main components, (Tsitsimpikou et al.
