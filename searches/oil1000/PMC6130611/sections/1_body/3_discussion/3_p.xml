<p class="p">To date, the cytotoxic activity of the EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> on the cancer cell lines HeLa, MCF-7 and CaCo-2 has not been studied. EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> needles exerted the highest activity on the three cancer cell lines, while EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> cones exerted the least effect. According to the American National Center Institute, plant extracts that show cytotoxicity with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> &lt; 30 μg/mL can be considered as potential agents for the development of anticancer drugs (Suffness &amp; Pezzuto 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>). Thus, on HeLa cell lines, EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> needles, 
 <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> twigs and 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> needles with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> lower than 0.03% can be considered as promising agents for anticancer drug development while on CaCo-2 cell lines, the EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> needles can be considered as promising agents. The cytotoxicity of these EOs may be attributed to the major components, such as phellandrene, α-pinene, β-pinene, germacrene D and α-terpinol. These constituents are similar to the main compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt. (Myristicaceae), which showed cytotoxic activities on CaCo-2 cell lines in a previous study (Piras et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). On MCF-7 cell lines, the highest activity was exerted by the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> needles, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> needles and twigs. This effect can be attributed to the high amount of α-pinene in the oils, which showed anti-proliferative activities on MCF-7 cell lines in a previous study (Cole et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>).
