<p class="p">Limonene is the major compound in both, needle and twig EOs from 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic>, with higher amount present in the twigs, followed by α-pinene and germacrene D, which is confirming to the results by Nikolić et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) who identified the same most abundant compounds in needle EOs in populations of Mts. Lovcen, Zeletin and Bjelasica; Montenegro, and Mt. Zlatibor to Mt. Pester; Serbia. There is a partial divergence to the dominant constituents (germacrene D &gt; limonene &gt; α-pinene) found by Nikolić et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) in needle EOs in populations of Mts. Ošljak and Galičica; Macedonia. These results are also similar to the investigation of EOs of needles, twigs and twigs with needles of 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> populations from Mt. Prenj (Bosnia and Herzigovina) by Chalchat et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>) and to the research about the EOs of needles of
