<p class="p">α-Pinene, a major compound in all 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus spp.</italic> may have an impact on the secretion profile of cytokines and thus, may play an important role in the anti-inflammatory activity. According to previous studies, the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Abies koreana</italic>, which is rich in bornyl acetate, limonene and α-pinene, inhibited the IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α production in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Yoon et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Furthermore, the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">Olea europaea</italic> L. (Oleaceae), with α-pinene as main constituent, exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity, assessed by the inhibition of paw oedema (Haloui et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Hippeli et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) hypotize, that the, up to now, unknown anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> EOs and its main compounds α-pinene, limonene and δ-3-carene, is generated by the down-regulation of increased activity of neutrophils, thus reducing the inflammatory reaction in the body. They also assume that hydrogen peroxide, which was found in aged 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> oils, maintains the accumulation of microbicide agents. Further 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies might confirm this hypothesis.
