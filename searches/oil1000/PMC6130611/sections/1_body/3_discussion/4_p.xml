<p class="p">Even though the EOs obtained from twigs and needles of 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> were rich in limonene, with higher concentration in 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> twigs, the better results were achieved from 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> needles. Thus, limonene was not the main responsible compound for the activity towards HeLa, MCF-7 and Caco-2 cell lines. These results indicate that the higher activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> needles are related to other main components such as germacrene D and β-pinene. Similar results were earlier reported, showing little cytotoxic activity of EOs rich in limonene (Bakarnga-Via et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This is in contrary to other studies, showing good cytotoxic activity of limonene (Miller et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). These finding suggest that the cytotoxic activity of the EOs are not always related to the main components only, indicating that the activity is related to the synergism or cumulative effect of different EO components, including the components in trace (Bakkali et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
