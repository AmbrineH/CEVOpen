<p class="p">GC/FID analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890 A GC System equipped with an FID detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The separation was conducted on an HP-5MS column 30 m × 0.25 mm with 0.25 μm film thickness. Helium was used as carrier gas with an initial flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and subsequently at a constant pressure of 50 psi. The front inlet was maintained at 250 °C in a split ratio of 50:1. The GC oven temperature was increased from 60 °C to 260 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and the FID operated at 280 °C with an air flow of 350 mL/min and a hydrogen flow of 35 mL/min. The injection volume was 1 μL.</p>
