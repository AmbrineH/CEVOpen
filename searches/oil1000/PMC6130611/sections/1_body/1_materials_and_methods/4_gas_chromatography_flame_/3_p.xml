<p class="p">Identification of the components of the essential oil was made by comparing their Kovats retention indexes with those in the literature (Adams 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). The calculation of the Kovats index was made based on a linear interpolation of the retention time of the homologous series of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C9-C28) under the same operating conditions. Furthermore, the components were identified by comparing the mass spectra of each constituent with those stored in the NIST 08.L and WILEY MS 9th database and with mass spectra from the literature (Adams 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). The percentage composition of the oils was computed by the normalization method from the GC peak areas, calculated as the mean of three samples, without correction factors.
