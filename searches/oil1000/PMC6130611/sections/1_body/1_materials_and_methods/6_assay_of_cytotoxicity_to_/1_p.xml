<p class="p">To determine cell viability and thus potential cytotoxicity of substances to three different cancer cell lines (HeLa, CaCo-2, MCF-7), an MTT-assay was performed as described above, but in 96-well plates. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL and incubated for 24 h before addition of the test substances at concentrations ranging from 0.001–0.1% and further incubation of 24 h. Then, the wells were loaded with 10 μL MTT solution. After another 2 h of incubation, the supernatant of each well was removed and the cells were lysed with 100 μL of lysis buffer. The absorption was measured at 570 nm and corrected by a reference wavelength of 690 nm. The amount of cells of the positive control (cells only incubated with DMEM) was defined as 100%. The results from the test substances were calculated as a % of the positive control. The entire assay of cytotoxicity was performed in triplicate on independent days.
