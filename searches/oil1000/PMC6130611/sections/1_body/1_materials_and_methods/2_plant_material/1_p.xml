 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii</italic> – 42°11′02″N, 20°54′56″E, 1555 m a.s.l). The collection sites were recorded using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (GARMIN, eTrex
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 30). Two to four replicate samples of needles, twigs and cones were analyzed, each sample was gathered from 2–3 individual plants from each population. Samples were distilled and analyzed separately.
