<p class="p">To examine the anti-inflammatory effect of the EOs, an assay with murine macrophages was performed as described in Mueller et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cells/mL into 24 well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, using DMEM (+10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 4 mM 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-glutamine) as culture medium. On the following day, the oils were added in concentrations ranging from 0.0001–0.2% and the cells were further incubated for 3 h. The macrophages were then treated with LPS at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL to stimulate cytokine production. After 24 h of incubation, the supernatant was removed and centrifuged to remove any cell residues. The IL-6 secretion was quantified using an ELISA, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (eBioscience).
