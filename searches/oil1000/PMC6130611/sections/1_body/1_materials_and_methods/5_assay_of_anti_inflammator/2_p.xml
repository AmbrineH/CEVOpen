<p class="p">In parallel, the viability of the LPS-stimulated cells was assessed using an MTT assay, based on the reduction of MTT to formazan by living cells. 50 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) was added to the cells and the plate was incubated for 2 h at normal culture conditions. The supernatant was then removed and the cells were lysed with a buffer, containing 10% SDS in 0.01 N HCl. Using a microplate reader (Infinite M200, Tecan, Austria), the optical density was measured at 570 nm, corrected by a reference wavelength of 690 nm.</p>
