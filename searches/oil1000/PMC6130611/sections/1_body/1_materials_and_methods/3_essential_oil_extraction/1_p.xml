<p class="p">The plant material was air-dried in shade at room temperature and cut into small pieces (&lt;0.5 cm). Separated needles, twigs (only wooden parts) and cones were subjected to essential oil distillation. For distillation, 50 g of dry tissue was placed into 0.5 L of water in a 1 L flask and distilled in a Clevenger apparatus for 3 h at a rate of 3 mL/min. The samples were stored in the dark at −18 °C in the freezer pending further analysis. The yield of essential oil is expressed as a percentage of the mass of the essential oil with respect to the air-dried material (% v/w of dried material).</p>
