<p class="p">The major compounds of the EOs in the needles were α-pinene and δ-3-carene, in the twigs the main compounds were δ-3-carene, limonene and β-pinene, while in cone EOs the major components were (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene and δ-3-carene. The EOs of the twigs of all three 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> spp. and the cones of 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> showed the most significant anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages. The EOs of the needles and twigs from 
 <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo,</italic> as well as the needles of 
 <italic class="italic">P. heldreichii,</italic> exerted the strongest cytotoxic activity on HeLa and CaCo-2 cell lines. On MCF-7 cell lines, the highest activity was shown by 
 <italic class="italic">P. peuce</italic> (twigs and needles) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. mugo</italic> needles. These EOs should be considered as potential agents for the development of new phytotherapeutic anticancer medicine.
