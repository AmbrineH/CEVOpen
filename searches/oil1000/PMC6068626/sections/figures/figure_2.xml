  <p class="p">Chemical structures of the classes of glycerophospholipids and glycolipids identified in olives and olive oil. Polar lipids include a broad range of molecules. Phospholipids are divided into two main classes depending on whether they contain glycerol (glycerophospholipids) or a sphingosyl (sphingophospholipids) backbone. Glycerophospholipids, besides the glycerol backbone, contain a polar phosphorus moiety. They derive mainly from 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1,2-diacylglycerols and, thus, contain structures that are based on 3-
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-phosphatidic acid [
   <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. These lipids are grouped into classes based on the composition of their polar head group that is attached to the phosphate residue in 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-3 position. The polar head may be an amino acid, an amino-alcohol, a carbohydrate or another functional moiety. Each head group class is further differentiated into subclasses based on the 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1 and 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 substituents on the glycerol backbone [
   <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Glycolipids also include a wide variety of structures. These structures consist in acylglycerols (in the case of glycosylglycerides and sulfolipids) joined to a carbohydrate moiety by a glycosidic linkage at the 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-3 position [
   <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Betaine lipids are ether-linked glycerolipids containing a betaine moiety. These lipids contain a polar group linked by an ether bond at the 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-3 position of the glycerol moiety, with the fatty acids esterified in the 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1 and 
   <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 positions [
   <xref rid="B31-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. 1,2-diacylglyceryl-3-O-4â€²-(
   <italic class="italic">N</italic>,
   <italic class="italic">N</italic>,
   <italic class="italic">N</italic>-trimethyl)-homoserine (DGTS) have been commonly found in lower plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria [
   <xref rid="B32-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. R, R1, and R2 represent fatty acyl chains.
