 <p> Chemical structures of the classes of glycerophospholipids and glycolipids identified in olives and olive oil. Polar lipids include a broad range of molecules. Phospholipids are divided into two main classes depending on whether they contain glycerol (glycerophospholipids) or a sphingosyl (sphingophospholipids) backbone. Glycerophospholipids, besides the glycerol backbone, contain a polar phosphorus moiety. They derive mainly from sn-1,2-diacylglycerols and, thus, contain structures that are based on 3- sn-phosphatidic acid [ 31]. These lipids are grouped into classes based on the composition of their polar head group that is attached to the phosphate residue in sn-3 position. The polar head may be an amino acid, an amino-alcohol, a carbohydrate or another functional moiety. Each head group class is further differentiated into subclasses based on the sn-1 and sn-2 substituents on the glycerol backbone [ 31]. Glycolipids also include a wide variety of structures. These structures consist in acylglycerols (in the case of glycosylglycerides and sulfolipids) joined to a carbohydrate moiety by a glycosidic linkage at the sn-3 position [ 31]. Betaine lipids are ether-linked glycerolipids containing a betaine moiety. These lipids contain a polar group linked by an ether bond at the sn-3 position of the glycerol moiety, with the fatty acids esterified in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions [ 31]. 1,2-diacylglyceryl-3-O-4â€²-( N, N, N-trimethyl)-homoserine (DGTS) have been commonly found in lower plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria [ 32]. R, R1, and R2 represent fatty acyl chains. </p>
