<p class="p">Olive oil mills and pitted table olivesâ€™ producing industries generate several by-products, such as olive pomace and olive stones. These by-products can be recovered to create novel value-added products. In the case of polar lipids, their concentration is tens to hundred times higher in olive pomace oil [
