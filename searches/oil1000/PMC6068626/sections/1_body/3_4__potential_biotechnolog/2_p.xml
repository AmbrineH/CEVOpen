<p class="p">Olive pomace was proposed as the new promising lipid source for the sustainable production of animal feeds, namely functional fish feeds, feed for aquaculture fish and as an ingredient for inclusion in animal feedstocks [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Olive pomace after stoning has been extensively studied in mammalâ€™s species as feed integration for improving the nutritional and nutraceutical properties of their meat as well as their milk and derived cheese [

 <xref rid="B40-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Other studies carried out on fish species revealed that polar lipids from olive pomace oil [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] provide high nutritional value for fish feed [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and increase fish cardio-protective properties [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The later studies carried out on fish fed with fish oil containing 4% of olive pomace indicated that the lipid fractions containing polar lipids had inhibitory activity against PAF-induced platelet aggregation [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Further research is needed on the bioactive properties of olive pomace and olive pomace oil for animal feed purposes and to identify the molecules within the polar lipid fraction responsible for such activity.
