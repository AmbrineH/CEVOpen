<p class="p">Some research groups studied olive oil’s polar lipids to address identity, traceability, and authenticity issues. A first approach based on the relative abundances of the glycerophospholipids allowed to distinguish the botanical and geographical origin of olive fruits. The olives samples used for the study were from different Spanish varieties (Empeltre, Lechín de Sevilla, and Arbequina) from the same region (Córdoba), and from the same variety (Arbequina) from different regions (Toledo, Córdoba and Jaén) [

There were variations on the relative abundance of the polar lipid classes identified in the seeds and in the pulp, and among different olive pulps from different cultivars. Some classes that were found in the pulp (lyso-PE and PE) were not detected in the respective seed and not all the classes were detected in all olive pulp samples. For instance, lyso-PA was not detected in Empeltre variety from Córdoba [

These findings are a promising start for future research on olive oil’s identity and traceability.
