<p class="p">Olive oilâ€™s chemical composition depends on both geographical and botanical origin of olives. It also varies with pedo-climatic, environmental, agricultural and technological conditions, which gives rise to a unique product with distinct features. High-quality olive oils, as VOOs, have a specific chemical fingerprint, but it has been difficult to assign an identity that can differentiate VOOs from other olive oils. Consequently, the authenticity of VOOs can be at risk during the olive oil chain production, and ultimately, it may lead to fraud or adulteration. To date, it has not been possible to provide an identity to each olive oil. </p>
