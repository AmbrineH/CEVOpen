<p class="p">Some studies evaluated the bioactive properties of the polar lipid fraction of olive oil and olive pomace and revealed that they possess anti-thrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic activities by inhibiting platelet aggregation. This inhibition was assigned to inhibitors or antagonists of platelet aggregation factor (PAF) [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], that were further identified in olive oil as a glycerol glycolipid [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Olive pomace’s polar lipids also inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The most potent antagonist was identified as a glycerylether-
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2-acetyl glycolipid, structurally similar to the one previously identified in olive oil [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Olive pomace’s polar lipids revealed a higher potency than olive oil’s polar lipids in inhibiting PAF-induced aggregation, as well as specific PAF binding [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Thus, olive pomace’s polar lipids were suggested to be used as a dietary supplement in the prevention of the progression of atherogenesis [
