<p class="p">There is some scientific evidence that the polar lipid fraction from olive oil and olive pomace possess anti-thrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic activity mediated by PAF. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to elucidate the chemical structure of the bioactive lipids to understand the mechanisms of action and to determine the concentration of these compounds in olive oil or olive-pomace to observe an in vivo effect in human beings.</p>
