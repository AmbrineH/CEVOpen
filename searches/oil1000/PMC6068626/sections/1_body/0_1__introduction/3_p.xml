<p class="p">Polar lipids are a group of minor components of olive oil [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The isolation, identification, and characterization of the minor components, such as polar lipids, might be essential to provide a molecular fingerprint for traceability and authenticity purposes [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The profiling of the major chemical components, such as triacylglycerols and total fatty acids, is insufficient to discriminate olives or olive oils, per se, and the simultaneous analysis of minor components is necessary [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. VOOs are very susceptible to fraud and to tampering with other oils, as lower grade olive oils [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. With recent analytical developments, new fast and sensitive methods have been claimed to evaluate olive oilâ€™s authenticity [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Therefore, it has become urgent to find foolproof analytical approaches and molecular markers to reveal a specific chemical identity for olives and olive oil and to detect adulterated olive oil [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Polar lipids have been suggested as promising molecular markers of identity [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Some research has been carried out towards their identification in olives and olive oil, mainly through mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches, but there is still much to be done.
