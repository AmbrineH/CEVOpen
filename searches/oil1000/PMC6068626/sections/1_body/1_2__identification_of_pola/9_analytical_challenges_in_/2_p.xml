<p class="p">There are several advantages of using HPLC-MS approaches. They allow a fast and reproducible analysis, in a short time-frame [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], with high sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. At the same time, it provides detailed structural information about the polar head and fatty acyl composition of each glycerophospholipid class, by the analysis and interpretation of the MS/MS data [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, some analytical bottlenecks of this methodology include: chemical noise in the MS/MS spectra and unachievable MS/MS identification of the fatty acyl chains for all glycerophospholipids, due to their low amount in the samples [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]; absence of fragmentation data, possibly due to their low concentration and the complexity of the matrix [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]; and the need for further validation of quantification values with absolute quantitative methods [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>].
