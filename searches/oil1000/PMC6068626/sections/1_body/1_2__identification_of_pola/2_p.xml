<p class="p">Liquid/liquid extraction (LLE) has been used for extracting polar lipids from olives and olive oil. The most commonly used LLE methods were a modified Bligh and Dyer method [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and a sequential LLE method developed by Galanos and Kapoulas [

 <xref rid="B19-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Solid-phase extraction (SPE), using aminopropyl-bonded silica as sorbent, was recently used to obtain polar lipid-enriched fractions directly from olive oil [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. There are other emerging extraction techniques that can be used for oil extraction from olives, such as ultrasound or microwave or CO
