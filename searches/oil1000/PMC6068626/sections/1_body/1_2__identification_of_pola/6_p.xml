In olive fruits, the polar lipidome has been studied in the oil extracted both from the pulp and the seed. Bianco et al. (1998) identified glycolipids in the olive pulp, namely digalactosyldiacylglycerols as DGDG(18:3/18:3) and DGDG(18:1/18:3) [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-07-00109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The glycerophospholipids identified in the olive pulp and in the seed included phosphatidic acid (PA), lyso-PA, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lyso-PE, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) [
