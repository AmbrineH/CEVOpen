 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>, one-way ANOVA of the data obtained from the cinnamon essential oil at the dose of 2 mg/kg showed a significant increase in the percent of time spent in the open arms/time spent in all arms or the percent of entries to open arm/total entries in mice placed at the center of EPM, in comparison with the vehicle-treated control group (
