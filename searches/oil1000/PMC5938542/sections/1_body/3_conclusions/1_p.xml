<p class="p">The anticancer, anti-inflammatory activities and chemical composition of PREO was evaluated. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay using colon, leukemia, multiple myeloma, pancreatic, head and neck and lung cancer cells. PREO caused cancer cell death and apoptosis at low concentration. PREO inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in cancer cells and this effect was correlated with the suppression of NF-ÎºB. The TNF-induced inflammation was also inhibited by PREO at very low concentration. On the other hand, the low-dose of PREO did not show cytotoxicity associated with normal physiological function. Therefore, the use of PREO might be a potential candidate as an anticancer agent, which needs to be investigated
