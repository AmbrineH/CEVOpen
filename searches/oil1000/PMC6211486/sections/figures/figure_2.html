 <p> Histology analyses of liver section and determination of hepatocyte inflammation. a Hepatic tissue section (40× magnification) of Oil Red O staining of Chinese perch fed with 2, 7, 12 and 17% dietary lipid levels. b Hepatic tissue section (40× magnification) of hematoxylin and eosin staining of Chinese perch fed with 2, 7, 12 and 17% dietary lipid levels. c Oil Red O relative area. d Measurement of hepatic cell nuclei. e Blood aspartate aminotransferase. Lipid droplets appear red after staining Oil Red O, and the depth of color of the red stain and the amount of the lipid droplet were positively correlated with lipid content. The nuclei of hepatocyte appear blue and the vacuole present to be hyaline after staining hematoxylin and eosin, and the numbers of nuclei were negatively correlated with hepatic steatosis. Ld, lipid droplet; Nu, nuclei; Va, vacuole. For C and D, Values are means ± SEM ( n = 3); for E, Values are means ± SEM (n = 6). Values with totally different letters on columns statistically differ at P &lt; 0.05 (one factor ANOVA, Duncan’s post hoc test) </p>
