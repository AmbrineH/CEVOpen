 <p> Proposed model of hepatic TG deposition in Chinese perch responding to high-fat intake. L17 represents diets containing of 17% lipid content, which was not benefit for hepatic lipid utilization and metabolism in the present study. In the liver, excess dietary fat-intake could accelerate the esterification of FFAs with the absence of FAs Î²-oxidation. Indeed, the extra uptake of FFAs could provide the mass Acyl-CoA substrate for lipogenesis via the up-regulation of srebp1. The sharply increased lipogenesis could effectively inhibit gluconeogenesis and aggravate TG deposition in liver although a part of newly-synthesized TG had been delivered to peripheral tissues via VLDL in blood </p>
