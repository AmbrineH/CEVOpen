 <p> The mRNA expression of the genes in hepatic triglyceride metabolism of Chinese perch. a-b The relative mRNA levels of hl and lpl were related to the triglyceride hydrolysis and hepatic FAs transport. c The relative mRNA abundance of cpt1 was related to FAs β-oxidation. d The relative mRNA level of cs was related to the conversion from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate into citrate. e The relative mRNA abundance of srebp1 was related to lipogenesis in liver. f-g The relative mRNA levels of accα and fas were related to FAs biosynthesis. h The relative mRNA abundance of apoe was related to triglyceride transport. i-k The relative mRNA levels of pc, pepck and g6pase were related to gluconeogenesis de novo. For A-K, Values are means ± SEM (n = 6). Values with totally different letters on columns statistically differ at P &lt; 0.05 (one factor ANOVA, Duncan’s post hoc test) </p>
