 <p> Proposed model of lipid metabolic strategy in Chinese perch responding to appropriate fat-intake. L7 and L12 represent diets containing of 7 and 12% lipid content, which was the optimal range of lipid level for fish growth and utilization in the present study. In the liver, the elevated FFAs-uptake could trigger FAs β-oxidation and then inhibit the lipogenesis to maintain stabilization of TG pool. The Acetyl-CoA derived from FAs β-oxidation could participate in TCA cycle for providing energy. Indeed, the substrate-glycerol derived from dietary TG hydrolysis would participate in gluconeogenesis and then prevent TG from accumulating in the liver. In this model, the homeostasis of hepatic TG pool and serum glucose was through the cooperation of FAs β-oxidation and gluconeogenesis </p>
