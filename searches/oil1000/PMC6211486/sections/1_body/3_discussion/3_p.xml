<p id="Par57" class="p">In addition, it was noticed that the whole-body lipid content of Chinese perch was gradually raised from L2 to L12 group, but the TG content in liver and muscle was stable, on the other hand, both the TG content in visceral adipose tissue and the VSI were increased markedly. Dietary fat (primarily TG) would be digested and absorbed in intestine, and then hydrolyzed in the lumen of the gut by pancreatic lipases, finally formed into FFAs. The FFAs were contiguously transported by lipoproteins lipase in blood and absorbed into liver or adipose tissue for esterification [
