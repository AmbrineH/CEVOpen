<p id="Par55" class="p">Among the evolution of most teleost fishes, an accurate and complicated metabolic system has been developed to respond to different nutritional states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. As it shown previously, the increased dietary fat usually could enhance the whole-body lipid content in teleost [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Meanwhile, the increase of dietary fat has been demonstrated to exert a protein-sparing effect and improve growth performance in most aquaculture fishes, especially in carnivorous species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Chinese perch, as a typical carnivorous fish, exhibited the slightly elevated growth rate and protein retention from L2 to L12 group, which suggested that dietary fat within certain limit was acted as energy source for better growth performance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, the acute decline in growth rate, food intake and protein retention were observed only in L17 group. Similar results were also found in European sea bass (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. It was indicated that excess fat-intake could result in the poor growth performance, anorexia symptoms and even lipid metabolic disorders [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Moreover, it also induced fish stored the extra energy in the form of neutral lipid (mainly TG) in liver, skeletal muscle and viscera cavity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Since mass TG has deposited in adipose tissue, it would lose the function of providing energy before the consumption of protein [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Regarding the priority of protein utilization in fish, a series of energy dissipation using protein would impair the protein-sparing effect.
