<p id="Par58" class="p">It is authenticated that high-fat diets could contribute to lipid accumulation in the whole body of teleost fishes, but the sites of fat deposition are highly species-specific. These previous studies have been approved that some fishes could store lipid mainly in liver, like cod [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>], but salmon could store high amount of lipid mainly in muscle fibers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Preliminary studies indicated that the whole-body lipid content of Chinese perch was elevated with the increased dietary fat from 12 to 17%, but both the VSI and the visceral TG content could not raise contrarily. Surprisingly, both the HSI and the hepatic TG content were significant higher in L17 group. The relative area of lipid droplets and the size of vacuoles in hepatocyte were increased and enlarged separately in L17 group. That means ectopic fat deposition and hepatic steatosis in hepatocyte [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. Moreover, the higher concentrations of TG, TC, LDL and HDL in blood suggested that the TG-rich metabolites were fast transported by the blood circulation between liver and peripheral tissue. The higher enzymic activity of AST indicated that hepatic injury was caused by TG infiltration in hepatocyte [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. Similar reports have confirmed that excess fat-intake would induce TG deposition and cause hepatic impairment in some aquaculture fish species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. The related mechanism of lipid deposition in liver with high-fat diet is illustrated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In short, compared to L12 group, higher FFAs-uptake in L17 group would speed up the esterification of acyl-CoA with the absence of FAs β-oxidation. It means that mass FFAs could not participate in mitochondrial oxidation for providing energy via TCA cycle. In contrast, it supplied more substrate of acyl-CoA to trigger lipogenesis via the up-regulation of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Meanwhile, the elevated lipogenesis could also inhibit the progress of gluconeogenesis, and then shut down the conversion from lipid to glycogen (seen in lower serum glucose). Although the newly-synthesized TG could be transported into peripheral tissues via VLDL (
 <italic class="italic">apoe</italic>) in bloodstream (seen in higher serum TC, TG and LDL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], it still could not alleviate the accumulation of TG in liver and the hepatic injury. It was confirmed that high-fat diet could induce the lipid metabolic disorders through the shutdown of FAs-oxidation and the unusual aggravation of lipogenesis in liver [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. In addition, the sharply decreased gluconeogenesis might be the additional factor of hepatic TG deposition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. In summary, the hepatic steatosis and injury were mainly due to the mass deposition of newly-synthesized TG, which was caused by the absence of lipolysis and the aggravation of lipogenesis.
