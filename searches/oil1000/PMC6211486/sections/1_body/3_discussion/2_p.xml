<p id="Par56" class="p">Within certain limit, the variation of dietary fat level from 2 to 12%, could not influence the homeostasis of hepatic lipid according to the TG content in liver and serum. Similar results had been reported in other fishes, like grass carp [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Meanwhile, the histomorphology of hepatocyte showed that small vacuoles and lipid droplets were emerged progressively in L7 and L12 group, which demonstrated that plasma lipid could pass in liver frequently through esterification of FFAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. But the amount of cell nuclei and relative area of lipid droplet exhibited no statistical difference among the L2, L7 and L12 group. It meant that the extra uptake of FFAs cannot be esterified into TG form and accumulated in hepatocyte. In order to expound the mechanism of lipid metabolism in liver, the expression of several key genes which participated in lipid (

 <italic class="italic">pepck</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">g6pase</italic>) were measured. The adaptive strategy responding to an appropriate fat-intake in the liver was briefly illustrated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Compared to L2 group, higher fat-intake in L7 and L12 group would accelerate dietary triglyceride hydrolysis and then produce more FFAs- and glycerol-substrate in liver. Higher FFAs-uptake could trigger the FAs β-oxidation via

 <italic class="italic">cs</italic>, suggesting that the process of TCA cycle was expedited with more acetyl-CoA. The oxidation of acetyl-CoA in TCA cycle could produce carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of ATP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Indeed, the increase of fat-intake could also promote the conversion from triglyceride hydrolysis to glycogen synthesis de novo. It was mainly due to that more substrate-glycerol could participate in gluconeogenesis once again via the TCA cycle. These major steps had been taken not only to maintain the concentration of serum glucose but also to prevent mass FFAs from being esterified into TG in liver [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. The decrease of lipogenesis in liver was mainly due to that it existed a dynamic balance between FAs β-oxidation and lipogenesis [
