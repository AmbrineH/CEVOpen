In mammal models, animals fed with high-fat diets would usually store lipid not only in white adipose tissue (WAT), a specific lipid deposit organ mainly composed of adipocytes, but also in other abnormal sites, such as liver, skeletal muscle, and even pancreatic β-cells, kidney [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>], the abnormal site of TG deposition was liver primarily in response to high-fat intake. Lipid deposition in abnormal sites could be emerged in three pathways: increased uptake of FAs, increased synthesis within the tissue involved and/or reduced FAs oxidation/disposal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. When it comes to excess fat-intake in organism, liver plays a critical role in lipid transport, lipid catabolism (mainly lipolysis and FAs b-oxidation), lipogenesis and even lipid deposition [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. Indeed, mass circulating FFAs in the blood could be absorbed into liver for esterification via lipogenesis and then repackaged with TG form, finally, delivered into extrahepatic tissue via TG-rich lipoprotein (mainly very low-density lipoprotein, VLDL). In briefly, the ectopic accumulation of TG in liver was due to an imbalance between lipid availability from circulating lipid uptake or lipogenesis and lipid disposal via FAs β-oxidation or TG-rich lipoprotein secretion [
