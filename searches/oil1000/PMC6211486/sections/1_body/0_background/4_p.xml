 <italic class="italic">Siniperca chuatsi</italic>), as a typical carnivorous freshwater fish, is one of the economical cultivated fish species in China as well in some other Asian countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. Chinese perch was treated as a suitable fish model for the fundament study of nutrition and metabolism because of its faster growth rate and higher tolerance to severe survival conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, Chinese perch owns a peculiar feeding habit, only after acclimation with a standard training protocol, could they accept artificial diets smoothly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Therefore, compared with the other cultivated freshwater fishes, Chinese perch need extra protein to satisfy its better growth performance, and the requirement of dietary protein was up to 47% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. So how to reduce the investment of protein by using lipid is a mentionable issue in cultivation of Chinese perch. Excess dietary fat, on the other hand, would also cause fatty degeneration, hepatic inflammation and fatty liver syndrome, and then caused an adverse effect on its health and carcass quality. Thereby, clarifying the inner mechanisms of lipid metabolism and deposition is an urgent issue based on the requirement of healthy aquaculture production and better nutritionists of Chinese perch. The hypothesis of this study was that Chinese perch could be possessed with the adaptive ability to maintain hepatic lipid homeostasis though selecting the priority site of TG deposit and accelerating lipid catabolism in response to dietary fat level with certain limits. But when it comes to high-fat diets, mass newly-synthesized TG could accumulate in liver primarily based on lipid metabolic disorders via the absence of lipid mobilization. To that end, the present study was conducted the effects and mechanism of dietary fat levels influencing growth performance and lipid metabolism.
