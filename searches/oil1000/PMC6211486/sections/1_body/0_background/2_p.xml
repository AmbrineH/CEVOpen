<p id="Par38" class="p">Although different fish species have different tolerance on exogenous fat-intake, natural selection endows fish with the abilities to store lipid in different organs when dietary fat is abundant, on the other hand, it accelerates lipid mobilization for providing energy. Generally, with the increasing dietary fat-intake, the lipid content of fish body was also increased progressively [

Besides, the homeostasis of hepatic lipid could depend on the hepatic mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation capacities. Because the activation of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation could accelerate the degradation of free fatty acids (FFAs) via carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) and then release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for providing energy through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [
