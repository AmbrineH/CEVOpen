<p id="Par43" class="p">After 5 weeks feeding trial, all the fishes were starved for 24 h and euthanized with MS-222 (Argent Chemical Laboratories, Redmond, WA, USA), and then weighted and counted. For each treatment, six fishes were randomly captured and stored in a freezer at − 20 °C until used for the whole-body chemical analysis. Blood was taken from the caudal vein of six fishes in each group and stored at 4 °C overnight, then centrifuged (2500 g, 20 min) for serum samples. Serum samples were frozen at − 80 °C until analysis. Tissue samples for lipid contents detection, like liver, mesentery and visceral adipose, were dissected from six fishes in each treatment and then stored at − 20 °C. Hepatic somatic index (HSI), mesentery fat index (MFI) and visceral somatic index (VSI) were calculated immediately after anatomy [HSI = the weight of liver / body weight (%), VSI = the weight of visceral adipose tissue / body weight (%) and MFI = the weight of mesenteric fat / body weight (%)]. Another six fishes per treatment were randomly chosen for molecular experiments, and liver tissue (0.5 g) for genes expression assay were fast frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at − 80 °C for RNA isolation and subsequent analysis.</p>
