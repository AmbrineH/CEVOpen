The determination of crude protein (N × 6.25) was conducted by using the Kjeltec system after acid digestion (K8400 Kjeltec Analyzer, Fossana Lyticab, Sweden). The crude lipid was measured by using the ether-extraction with Soxtec System HT (SE-A6, Alvah, China). Ash was determined by combustion with muffle furnace (SX2–4-10, Zhengda Electric Technology Co., Ltd., China) at 550 °C for 12 h.
