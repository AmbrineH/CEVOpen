<p id="Par46" class="p">Liver tissues from three fishes from each group were collected and immediately fixed by using 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde for 4 days. After dehydrated and imbedded into paraffin, a tissue section was cut into 5 μm for hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining (Catalog no. G1005–100; Servicebio Biotech Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). For the frozen section and Oil-red O staining, liver samples were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. Serial frozen sections were cut into 8 μm for Oil-red O staining. The dried slides are washed by dipping them one or two times in 70% alcohol, and they are then placed on an absorbent surface and covered with the Oil Red O solution (Catalog no. G1016; Servicebio Biotech Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) for 5 min. The liver sections were viewed at 40× magnification. Three slides from each group were included in quantification and 5 fields were randomly selected on each slide. For each field, the number of cell nuclei in the H&amp;E observation and the relative area of lipid droplet in Oil Red O observation were quantified by Image J software (National Institutes of Health) following previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. The TG contents in liver, visceral adipose tissue and muscle were performed by the manufacturer of Triglycerides Assay Kit (Catalog no. F001; Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).
