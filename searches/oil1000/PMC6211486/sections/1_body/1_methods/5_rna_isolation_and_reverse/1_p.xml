<p id="Par47" class="p">Prior to RNA isolation, liver tissues were taken out from the - 80 °C fridge and unfrozen on the ice. Trizol reagent (Code no. 9108; TaKaRa, Japan) was use as a lysis buffer for liver tissues, added 1 mL with 0.1 g liver sample. Followed by the manufacture’s instruction, RNA is purified by phenol/chloroform extraction of the lysate supernatant followed by ethanol precipitation. The extracted RNA was dissolved in 50–100 μL RNase-free water (Code no. 9750; TaKaRa, Japan). The RNA integrality was examined with agarose gel electrophoresis. The concentration of RNA samples was quantified with a BioTek Synergy™ 2 Multi-detection Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, USA). Then 1 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with HiScript® II Reverse Transcriptase (Code no. R201–01/02; Vazyme, China) in a 20 μL reaction volume. The synthesized cDNA was stored at − 20 °C until further use.</p>
