<p id="Par59" class="p">In conclusion, with the increase of dietary fat-intake in L7 and L12 group, the extra uptake of FFAs and glycerol derived from triglyceride hydrolysis would accelerate the FAs β-oxidation and the gluconeogenesis respectively. The negative regulation of FAs β-oxidation could effectively depress lipogenesis, and then shut down the esterification of FFAs. These procedures were critical to maintain the homeostasis of hepatic TG pool and serum glucose, indeed, improve growth performance and reduce the consumption of dietary protein. However, high-fat diet in L17 group could easily impair hepatic lipid homeostasis and induce lipid metabolic disorder, which was caused by the absence of lipolysis and the aggravation of lipogenesis. In addition, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis could also aggravate the TG deposition in liver and then induce the hepatic steatosis. Both the hepatic injury and the decrease of serum glucose could impair the normal physiological status and slow the growth rate in Chinese perch. Overall, our study unraveled the main inducement between the impaired lipid homeostasis and the aggravated lipid deposition in liver, and it might provide implications for the investigation of fatty liver syndrome in teleost fishes.</p>
