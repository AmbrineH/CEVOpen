<p id="Par54" class="p">Some relative genes expression, which were involved in the lipid and glucose metabolism in liver of Chinese perch, were analyzed by real-time qPCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The relative mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase (
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic>) and hepatic lipase (
 <italic class="italic">hl</italic>), the key regulator of TG hydrolysis and FAs transport in liver, were increased progressively from L2 to L17 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">b</xref>). The relative mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (
 <italic class="italic">cpt1</italic>) and citrate synthase (
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic>), the two major rate-limiting enzyme participated in FAs β-oxidation and TCA circle respectively, were elevated significantly in L7 and L12 group, but it showed no difference between L12 and L17 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">d</xref>). The expression of lipogenic genes, including in sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (
 <italic class="italic">srebp1</italic>), acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (
 <italic class="italic">accα</italic>) and fatty acid synthase (
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic>), were sharply down-regulated both in L7 and L12 group, and then up-regulated in L17 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">f</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">g</xref>). The overexpression of Apo-lipoprotein E (
 <italic class="italic">apoe</italic>), the key regulator of TG transport, was observed only in L17 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3h</xref>). The abundance of glycogenic genes, including in pyruvate carboxylase (
 <italic class="italic">pc</italic>), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (
 <italic class="italic">pepck</italic>) and glucose-6-phosphatase (
 <italic class="italic">g6pase</italic>), were markedly raised both in L7 and L12 group, but declined in L17 group instead (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3i</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">j</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">k</xref>).
