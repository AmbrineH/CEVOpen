<p id="Par53" class="p">Excessive fat intake was usually correlated with the ectopic TG deposition in liver. In order to investigate whether high-fat diets could induce hepatic steatosis in Chinese perch, we performed Oil-red O staining and H&amp;E staining on liver sections (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The Oil-red O staining confirmed that the number of red dots (lipid droplets) has exhibited no obvious difference among L2, L7 and L12 group, but it increased sharply in L17 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Indeed, the H&amp;E staining showed that liver cells appeared small vacuoles progressively from L2 group to L12 group, but in L17 group, the vacuole was enlarged sharply and then squeezed the cell nuclei to the edge (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). These results were further confirmed by the quantified area for lipid droplets in the Oil-red O staining and by the number of cell nuclei in the H&amp;E staining. The relative area of lipid droplet in L17 group was significantly larger than other groups, on the other hand, the number of cell nuclei was descended only in L17 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">d</xref>). That means liver cells had suffered from pathological reaction which was induced by TG infiltration. In addition, the AST enzymatic activity in blood, a maker of hepatic injury, was significantly elevated in L17 group compared with other groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>).
