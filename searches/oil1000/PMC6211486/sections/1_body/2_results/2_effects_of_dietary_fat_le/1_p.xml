 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The MFI and the TG content in muscle showed no difference among the four groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">g</xref>). Compared to L2 group, the VSI and the TG content in visceral adipose tissue were increased markedly in both L7 and L12 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">f</xref>). The HSI and the TG content in liver and serum showed no difference among L2, L7 and L12 group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">h</xref>). Compared to L12 group, the HSI and the TG content in liver and serum were raised significantly in L17 group, but the VSI and the TG content in visceral adipose tissue were stable.
