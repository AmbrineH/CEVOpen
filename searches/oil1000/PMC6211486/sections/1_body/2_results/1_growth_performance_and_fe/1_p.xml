<p id="Par50" class="p">After 5 weeks feeding trial, the feed utilization and growth performance were presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. From L2 to L12 group, the food intake (FI) showed no significant difference, but the final weight (FW), weight gain (WG), specific growth ratio (SGR) and protein retention (PR) were progressively elevated. All of the above indices were decreased markedly in L17 group compared to L12 group.
