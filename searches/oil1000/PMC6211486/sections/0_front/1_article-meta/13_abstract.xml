  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">Previous studies in teleost have demonstrated the adaptive strategy to maintain hepatic lipid homeostasis within certain limit. The excess of fat-intake could induce abnormal lipid deposition in liver but not adipose tissue. However, the molecular mechanism between the impaired lipid homeostasis and the aggravated lipid deposition in liver has not been elucidated well in fish.</p>

  <title class="title">Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">Four isonitrogenous diets with different fat levels (2, 7, 12 and 17%) were formulated, named L2, L7, L12 and L17 respectively, and fed Chinese perch (44.50 ± 0.25 g) to apparent satiation for five weeks. Growth index, triglyceride concentrations and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism were measured.</p>

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p id="Par3" class="p">The maximal growth performance and food intake were observed in L12 group. The lipid content in liver and serum were comparable in L2, L7 and L12 groups, while they were increased significantly in L17 group. Histology analysis also demonstrated that mass lipid droplets emerged in hepatocyte and then induced hepatic steatosis in L17 group. Compared to L2 group, the lipolytic genes related to fatty acids (FAs) transport (

   <italic class="italic">hl</italic>) and FAs β-oxidation (
   <italic class="italic">cpt1</italic> &amp; 
   <italic class="italic">cs</italic>) were increased in L7 and L12 group. Relative mRNA levels of the gluconeogenesis (
   <italic class="italic">pc</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">pepck</italic> &amp; 
   <italic class="italic">g6pase</italic>) were also increased, in contrast, the lipogenic genes (
   <italic class="italic">srebp1</italic>, 
   <italic class="italic">accα</italic> &amp; 
   <italic class="italic">fas</italic>) were decreased. Compared to L12 group, L17 group had higher mRNA levels of the FAs transport and the lipogenesis. But the lipolytic genes related to FAs β-oxidation were steady and the mRNA levels of gluconeogenesis were down-regulated instead.

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4" class="p">Within certain limit, the increase of dietary fat in L7 and L12 group was propitious to reduce the consumption of protein and improve growth performance in Chinese perch. It was due to the homeostasis of hepatic triglyceride (TG) pool and serum glucose through promoting the FAs β-oxidation and gluconeogenesis respectively. Both the increase of lipogenesis and the absence of FAs β-oxidation in L17 group could trigger the esterification of FAs, indeed, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis could also aggravate triglyceride accumulation in liver and induce hepatic steatosis.</p>
