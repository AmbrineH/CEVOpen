<p class="p">The presence of bioactive compounds that possess antioxidant properties causes lemon verbena essential oil to inhibit the formation of oxidation products in sunflower oil. Oxidative Stability Index (OSI) test revealed the superiority of essential oil of lemon verbena than the BHT, in preventing of oil oxidation. More reduction in peroxide value, free fatty acid, total polar compounds, carbonyl value, and conjugated dienes in sunflower oil by adding lemon verbena essential oil than BHT was observed by test results. In this study, it is clearly indicated that 1,600Â ppm of this essential oil in stabilization of sunflower oil can act as the same effective as BHT. So, lemon verbena may be considered a cheap potential source of bioactive compounds for application as antioxidants in lipid foods.</p>
