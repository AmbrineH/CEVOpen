<p class="p">A huge amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be found in sunflower oil, more than 70%. These PUFAs are prone to lipid oxidation. During storage, the double bonds of these PUFAs are attacked by free radicals, which results in the formation of conjugated bonds (Avramović et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Hence, measuring the amount of unsaturated fatty acids present in sunflower oil can be used as a reference to determine the freshness of the oil. Adding iodine monochloride to the oil samples can be used for determining the freshness of sunflower oil. The unsaturated fatty acids react with iodine monochloride and release free iodine. The free iodine can then react with sodium thiosulfate (Martínez, Sánchez, Encinar, &amp; González,

 <xref rid="fsn3637-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. A decrease in amounts of iodine value of samples including lemon verbena essential oil and samples containing synthetic antioxidant (BHT) was observed between 0 to 60 days. This decrease is indicative of the increase in rate of oxidation due to oxidation of double bonds. Samples including 1,200 ppm of lemon verbena essential oil (121.35) showed the maximum of iodine value during 60 days. The lower IV of sunflower oil including BHT (108.00) compared to lemon verbena essential oils supported the lower efficacy of BHT to protect the oxidation of double bonds of fatty acids in sunflower oil.
