<p class="p">Induction period (IP) provides direct evidence for trends in resistance to oxidative rancidity of vegetable oils. The Rancimat analysis aimed to measure the IP by detecting the formed volatile acids during oil oxidation. Test results for oxidative stability index (OSI) are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. It has been seen that IP of the sunflower oil samples with added lemon verbena essential oil or synthetic antioxidant (BHT) would be significantly larger (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) than that of the blank sunflower oils. The samples of lemon verbena essential oil (1,600 and 3,200 ppm) showed an intensive improvement in the OSI value of the sunflower oil in comparison with samples containing synthetic antioxidant (BHT) and control. It was inferred that the lemon verbena essential oil was more effective in stabilizing oil against oxidative deterioration compared to synthetic antioxidants (BHT). Moreover, Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows the OSI of the sunflower oil samples as affected by different concentrations of lemon verbena essential oil by Rancimat during storage time. All samples of lemon verbena essential oil significantly improved the OSI of the sunflower oil compared to control (1.71 hr) during storage time (60 days). The highest stabilizing effect belonged to 1,600 ppm of the essential oil with 5.94 hr after 60 days, followed by 800 ppm of the essential oil (5.80 hr), 200 ppm BHT (5.67 hr), and 400 ppm of the essential oil (5.37 hr).
