<p class="p">In here, all of the degradation products without the nonpolar fraction (unaltered triglycerides) will collectively be referred as the total polar compounds (TPC). The changes in total polar compounds are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. These data demonstrated a significant increase in TPCs for all the treatments during storage time. It was concluded from the results that the most stable formulation in terms of the TPCs would be obtained by addition of the lemon verbena essential oil (1,600 ppm). On day 60, higher values of TPCs of the essential oil of lemon verbena are attributed to control with 11.48%, followed by BHT (11.04%), 400 ppm of the lemon verbena essential oil (8.90%). 800 ppm of the essential oil (8.05%), and 1,600 ppm of the essential oil (7.92%).
