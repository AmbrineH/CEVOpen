<p class="p">To indicate the potential antioxidant activity of plant essential oil, synthetic free radical scavenging (DPPH) model will be valuable tool. However, this system does not use a food or biologically relevant oxidizable substrate, so no direct information on an essential oil's protective action can be determined (Kreps, Vrbiková, &amp; Schmidt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Therefore, assessing the essential oil in β‐carotene/linoleic acid was considered important: water emulsion assay despite its reported limitations. This assay applies that the oxidation of linoleic acid would generate peroxyl free radicals according to the abstraction of hydrogen atom from methylene groups of linoleic acid. The highly unsaturated β‐carotene will be oxidized by the free radicals. The oxidation of β‐carotene will be minimized by the presence of antioxidants in the lemon verbena essential oil. The antioxidants from the essential oil will decompose hydroperoxides formed in this system. So it can be inferred that the degradation rate of β‐carotene is dependent on the antioxidant activity of the essential oils. As can be seen in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, the oxidation of β‐carotene was reduced due to the presence of antioxidants in lemon verbena essential oil especially in 1,600 and 3,200 ppm. The lemon verbena essential oils possess the potential for scavenging free radicals in a complex heterogeneous medium, according to the β‐carotene/linoleic acid bleaching data in Figure
