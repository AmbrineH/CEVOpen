<p class="p">Absorbance at 234 nm provides a measure of the content of conjugated dienes (CD), which represent the degree of production of the primary oxidation products (Dridi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The changes in conjugated dienes are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. It is obviously observed that, while the concentrations of lemon verbena essential oil added to the sunflower oil samples are increased, these conjugated diene concentrations decrease. A significant difference was observed in the absorbance of the sunflower oil treated with lemon flower essential oil from the control oil (11.56 ± 1.51) and from the oils with the addition of the synthetic antioxidants (BHT) (10.57 ± 1.00). At the end of storage, oils with 800 and 1,600 ppm of lemon verbena essential oil had minimum value of CD that was 7.44 ± 0.16 and 7.41 ± 0.16, respectively. The effectiveness of lemon verbena essential oil, with the presence of phenolic and tocopherol content, was exhibited in preventing oxidative rancidity along with showing greater stabilizing effect. Hence, there is a higher possibility for replacing synthetic antioxidants. Kiralan et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) researched on the changes in hexanal, thymoquinone, and tocopherols contents in sunflower including black cumin oils during storage at room temperature. The results indicated that levels of PV, CD, and conjugated triene in sunflower oil and blends increased with an increase in storage time. And stability of blends was better than sunflower oil, due to changes in the amounts of thymoquinone and tocopherols found in black cumin oil.
