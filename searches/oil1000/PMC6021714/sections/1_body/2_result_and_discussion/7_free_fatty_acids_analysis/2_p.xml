<p class="p">One important measure of rancidity of foods might be recognized as formation of free fatty acids (Asnaashari, Asnaashari, Ehtiati, &amp; Farahmandfar, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). FFA are formed due to hydrolysis of triglycerides and may get promoted by reaction of oil with moisture. The large amount of FFAs, especially low molecular weight ones which have been released by hydrolysis from the glycerides due to moisture, temperature, and lipolytic enzyme reactions, is responsible for undesirable flavors and aromas in oils. The changes in free fatty acids content are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. During the 60‐day storage, an increase in amount of free fatty acids content of all samples was observed. However, the samples with 400, 800, and 1,600 ppm of lemon verbena essential oil showed a significant (

So, inhibitory effects of sunflower oil samples with lemon verbena essential oil based on FFA were better than those of BHT. Ramadan (
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) investigated the healthy blends of sunflower oil including (10% and 20%, w/w) of cold‐pressed oils including black cumin oil, cumin oil, coriander oil, and clove oil. Primary and secondary oxidation parameters measurement was made. The results showed the same relationships between PV and AV at termination of storage.
