<p class="p">Peroxides are the main initial products of oil oxidation and can be determined using the peroxide value (PV) (Asnaashari, Hashemi, Mohammad, Mehr, &amp; Asadi Yousefabad, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). A higher peroxide value implies a lower oxidative stability (Farahmandfar, Asnaashari, &amp; Sayyad, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The changes in peroxide values are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. A sharp increase in PV values of all the sunflower oils with and without added antioxidants was observed during the 60‐day storage. The presence of unstable compounds that are susceptible to oxidation was the cause of increase in the PV values. The samples with 800 and 1,600 ppm of lemon verbena essential oil showed a significant decrease (

As a consequence, oil samples with lemon verbena essential oil incorporated demonstrated significantly lower PV values than that of oils with synthetic antioxidant (BHT) incorporated. Iqbal and Bhanger (
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) investigated sunflower oil stabilization by garlic extract during accelerated storage. Results from different oxidation parameters indicated sunflower oil including 500 and 1,000 ppm of garlic extract has potential to act as a natural antioxidant in sunflower oil stabilization.
