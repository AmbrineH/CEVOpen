<p class="p">Carbonyl compounds in foods can arise from lipid oxidation and particularly during heating (Asnaashari, Farahmandfar, &amp; Kenari, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). While lipid oxidation is taking place, primary products transform into secondary products such as carbonyls. Secondary products of oxidation can be estimated by measuring carbonyl value (CV) (Kiralan et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The changes in carbonyl values are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The oils with 800 and 1,600 ppm of lemon verbena essential oil showed significantly (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05) lower CV values (11.96 ± 0.53 and 11.21 ± 0.53 μmol/g, respectively) than other samples. It was concluded from the results that 800 and 1,600 ppm of lemon verbena essential oil were more efficient to inhibit oil oxidation than BHT (16.25 ± 0.25 μmol/g). It can be seen that increase in CV in the presence lemon verbena essential oil is slightly lower than sunflower oil samples without any essential oil.
