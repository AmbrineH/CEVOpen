<p class="p">The absorption range of DPPH free radical is maximum within 515–528 nm (Farahmandfar et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Immediately after receiving proton from any hydrogen donor, especially from phenolics, it instantly loses its chromophore and becomes yellow (Farahmandfar et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). As the concentration of antioxidative compounds increases, their DPPH radical scavenging activity also increases and can be defined as antioxidant activity. DPPH radical scavenging test is applied as a rapid method to determine antioxidant activity of chemical substances. Bleaching is known to occur via abstraction of hydrogen by this stable free radical with a maximum absorption band around 515–528 nm and can easily be monitored spectrophotometrically. The antioxidant activity of plant essential oil such as lemon verbena essential oil related to their ability to donate hydrogen atoms or electrons and free electrons (Sharopov, Wink, &amp; Setzer, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). DPPH radical scavenging of lemon verbena essential oil was measured in triplicate and is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. As can be seen, as concentration of the essential oil raised, the DPPH radical inhibition also enhanced. Moreover, the sunflower oil samples including 3,600 ppm of lemon verbena essential oil also act better than BHT in radical scavenging ability. This can be a result of the capability of components within lemon verbena essential oil for scavenging free radicals via electron or hydrogen‐donating mechanisms.
