<p class="p">Oxidation scavenging activity of lemon verbena essential oil was carried out using β‐carotene bleaching method (Bektas, Serdar, Sokmen, &amp; Sokmen, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). For this purpose, 5 mg of β‐carotene was dissolved in 10 ml chloroform solvent (high‐performance liquid chromatography grade). Then, 600 μl removed from the prepared solution and were mixed with 40 mg of linoleic acid and 400 mg of Tween 40. Chloroform need to completely evaporate. For this purpose, the rotary vacuum evaporator was used. In the next step, 100 ml distilled water saturated with oxygen was added and gently stirred. 2.5 ml of the solution was transferred in the test tube. Then, 350 μl of each essential oil with a concentration of 2 g/L was added to the test tube. All of the above were performed for blanks. All samples were put into a water bath with temperature of 50°C for 120 min. Then, the samples’ absorbance was read using a spectrophotometer at 470 nm at zero and 120 min. To determine the antioxidant capacity of essential oils, the following equation was used:
