 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg oil) of sunflower oil samples containing different concentrations of lemon verbena essential oil and BHT was measured spectrophotometrically at 500 nm by UV‐VIS instrument (model 160A Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The oil samples were mixed in with 9.8 ml chloroform–methanol (7:3 v/v) on a vortex mixer for 2–4 s. Ammonium thiocyanate solution (50 ml, 30% w/v) and 50 ml of iron (II) chloride solution ([0.4 g barium chloride dihydrate dissolved in 50 ml H

Then, the absorbance of the sample was read, after 5 min incubation at room temperature (Asnaashari, Farhoosh, &amp; Farahmandfar,
