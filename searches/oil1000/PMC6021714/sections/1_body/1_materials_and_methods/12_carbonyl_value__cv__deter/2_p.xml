<p class="p">For CV analysis of sunflower oil samples including different concentrations of lemon verbena essential oil and BHT, one kilogram of 2‐propanol with 0.5 g of sodium borohydride was refluxed for 1 hr to remove any carbonyl components of solvent. Then, 2,4‐dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) (50 g) was dissolved in 100 ml of the solvent including 3.5 ml of 37% HCL. 0.04–1 gr of the oil sample was made by adding the solvent including triphenylphosphine (0.4 mg/ml) to reach 10 ml. Moreover, the solutions of 50–500 μmol/L of 2,4‐decadienal in 2‐propanol were prepared. Then, standard carbonyl compound solution or oil solution (1 ml) and DNPH solution (1 ml) were mixed in a tube. After that, the tube was heated (20 min, 40°C) and cooled in water bath after adding 2% KOH (8 ml). Finally, the absorbance of upper layer after centrifuging (2,000×
