 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) method. At first, silica gel 60, dried (12 hr) at 160 °C, was added five parts of water to 95 parts of it and was shaken vigorously for about 1 min and stay overnight. Then, the silica gel 60 (1 g) was compressed and filled between two cotton wool balls into a pipette tip. Oil sample (500 mg) and toluene (4 ml) were mixed, and finally, the solution (1 ml) was pipetted on top of the pipette tip and used toluene as the eluent. After the solvent was eliminated, weighing TPC% was calculated by the equation of 100 (w−w
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>)/w, in which w and w
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> are the sample weight and the weight of nonpolar compounds in milligrams, respectively.
