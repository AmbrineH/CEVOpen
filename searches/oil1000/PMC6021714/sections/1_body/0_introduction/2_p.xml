<p class="p">Lipid oxidation is a major cause for the deterioration of fat‐containing food. Furthermore, it initiates other undesirable changes in food affecting its nutritional quality, safety, color, flavor, and texture (Ramadan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sayyari &amp; Farahmandfar, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Autoxidation of polyunsaturated lipids involves a free radical chain reaction that is generally initiated by exposure of the lipids to light, heat, radiation, metal ions, or metalloprotein catalysts (Eshghi, Asnaashari, Haddad Khodaparast, &amp; Hosseini, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Therefore, the inhibition of free radical autoxidation by antioxidants is of great practical importance in preserving polyunsaturated lipids from deterioration. Synthetic compounds, such as butylated hydroxyanisole (Iqbal and Bhanger), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate (PG), and tert‐butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), are widely used antioxidants due to their low cost, high stability, and effectiveness (Asnaashari, Tajik, &amp; Khodaparast, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, possible toxicological side effects of synthetic antioxidants on human health were reported. The synthetic antioxidants have been widely used to control lipid oxidative rancidity in foods, which is a major cause of quality deterioration, nutritional losses, off‐flavor development, and discoloration. Besides, prolonging the shelf life of food products, these compounds are able to retard the progress of many oxidative stress‐related chronic diseases in human (Farahmandfar, Safari, Ahmadi Vavsari, &amp; Bakhshandeh, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Therefore, dietary antioxidants also have an important role as nutraceuticals due to their role in protecting the body from free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species, which are derived either from normal metabolic processes or from external sources (Farhoosh, Johnny, Asnaashari, Molaahmadibahraseman, &amp; Sharif,

 <italic class="italic">Lippia citriodora</italic>) grows spontaneously in South America and is cultivated in North Africa (Morocco) and southern Europe. In these areas, the leaves are largely used as herbal tea for their aromatic, digestive, and antispasmodic properties (Casamassima et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The lemon verbena is a folk remedy for colds, fever, spasms asthma, flatulence, colic, diarrhea, indigestion, insomnia, and anxiety (Bilia, Giomi, Innocenti, Gallori, &amp; Vincieri, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Choupani, Arabshahi Delouee, &amp; Alami, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Felgines, Fraisse, Besson, Vasson, &amp; Texier, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The essential oil from its leaves has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity (Kiafar, Zadeh, &amp; Khommami, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Shafiee, Moghadamnia, Shahandeh, Sadighian, &amp; Khodadadi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Also, antioxidant activity has also been detected in lemon verbena leaves (Felgines et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), which it has been associated with the presence of flavonoids and phenolic acids (Naser Aldeen, Mansoor, &amp; AlJoubbeh, 
 <xref rid="fsn3637-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The objective of our research was to investigate the antioxidant activity of lemon verbena essential oil. Moreover, oxidative stability of sunflower oil added different concentrations of the essential oil using primary and secondary oxidation products was also determined.
