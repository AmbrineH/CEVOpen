<p class="p">Since postharvest fresh produce is vulnerable to many microorganisms responsible for degradation, its quality can be considerably affected by leading to a shortened shelf-life. Edible coatings such as polysaccharide and protein-based coatings could be used to create thin films, which are applied on the surfaces of fruits and prevent bacteria growth, as well as the growth of yeast and molds [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01695-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, the efficacy in reducing microbial growth with these coatings might be primarily due to the type, concentration, and properties of coating films as well as the type, size, shape, concentration, chelation, release and photocatalytic properties of incorporated NPs [
