<p class="p">According to Hasheminya et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], the bacteria of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> were effectively restricted by the kefiran-CMC-CuONPs bio-NC. While Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>] indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> were significantly inhibited by CS capped SNP composite film, which displayed the highest antimicrobial activity with complete sterilization within 6 h and 12 h, respectively. Furthermore, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] indicated that bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli, B. subtilis, Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Penicillium, S. aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">yeast</italic> responded exceptionally well to the antimicrobial effect of the CS/Ag/ZnO film combinations. More importantly, the chelating function among different NPs might also affect by the antimicrobials efficacy of separate NPs [

 <xref rid="B111-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>], AgNPs appeared to improve the antibacterial properties of both Ag-ZnO NPs without UV radiation. The higher antibacterial activity of Ag-ZnO NPs (chemical deposition (CD)) was found that that of ZnO NPs and Ag-ZnO NPs [

 <xref rid="B112-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>] also reported that the highest photocatalytic antibacterial activity was obtained at over 92 wt.% SiO

 <xref rid="B87-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] indicated that nano-Ag particles displayed lower antibacterial activity than the Ag/TiO
