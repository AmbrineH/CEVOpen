<p class="p">During the entire storage period, reactive oxygen with a stronger oxidizing ability caused severe damage to the cell membranes of fresh produce. Defense enzymes such as peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were able to remove the factors leading to degradation [

Moreover, CS treatment induced a significant increase in the activities of CAT and SOD, and inhibited the production of superoxide radicals, which possibly delayed content modifications in MDA and the cell membrane permeability of fruit [

 <xref rid="B150-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">150</xref>]. This efficacy was dependent on the concentration of CS used. The molecular weight of CS might attribute to the antioxidative influence of active compounds in the coating film and the transfer of free electrons from the peroxide to the CS electron sink [

 <xref rid="B152-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>] indicated that no significant loss was evident in the moisture content of vegetables from NPs-impregnated packets, but the loss in those without the addition of AgNPs impregnation was considerable. The control of moisture content and the nutritional profile in pockets containing NPs might be related to the cell permeability of vegetables.
