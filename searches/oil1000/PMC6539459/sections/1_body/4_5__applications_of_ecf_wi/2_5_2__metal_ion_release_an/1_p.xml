<p class="p">Free metal-ions released from the surface of carriers played an antimicrobial role in eradicating microorganisms on the exterior of agricultural products [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. An investigation by Cano et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] indicated that the simulants A (ethanol 10% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)), C (ethanol 20%(
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)), and D1 (ethanol 50% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>)) displayed similar release profiles of silver, while simulants B (acetic acid, 3% (
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>), with low pH) and D2 (oleic acid as a vegetal oil, non-polar medium) behaved differently. The release of silver was encouraged by the water absorption of the film in aqueous systems. Most of the release occurred within the first 60 min, while 100% of the silver was released following 60 min of immersion in the acidic medium (simulant B). Furthermore, Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] examined the silver ions released from the Ag/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> composite films, and noted a rapid increase in the released quantities during the first five days, followed by a steady decline in the release rate. Additionally, Wei et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] established that Cu ion concentrations were released from the plastic coatings at 1 wt.%, while the release rate gradually declined after 5 h. According to Salarbashi et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], no TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) in bread samples covered with SSPS/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> film and kept in storage for six months. A minuscule amount of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> released from the NC films was observed in water. More importantly, long-term exposure of cells to uncoated NPs elicited that the presence of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs were in the plasma membrane of the epithelial cell line. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] determined that a slower release behavior of silver ions occurred in mesoporous Ag/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> films in comparison with bulk matrixes.
