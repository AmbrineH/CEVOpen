<p class="p">The release of NPs or metal-ions into a system is affected by various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to the microstructure of the coating carrier, the particle and ion diffusion to the medium via the polymer, medium migration to the polymer matrix and its expansion, as well as the polymer solubility in the medium phase [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Moreover, the polymer chains might be rearranged by increasing the immersion and storage times. This process could increase the intermolecular interactions, decrease the mobility of polymer chains, and control the dissolved and released NPs to some extent [

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], different release behaviors in the non-polar simulant might be induced by the limited diffusion of oleic acid in the polar matrix by maintaining a closed network structure for the carrier matrix. However, by increasing the ethanol concentrations in the stimulant, the polarity of medium could be reduced and the hydration process of the polymer network could be controlled, and possibly silver diffusion was reduced. On the other hand, the film compositions and initial NPs concentrations also affect the NPs release [

 <xref rid="B103-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. This efficacy might further modify the differences in antimicrobial activity due to variations on the surfaces of free ions or NPs that are thought responsible for inhibiting the microorganisms.
