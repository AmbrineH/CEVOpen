Results indicated that the respiration rate and ethylene production rate decreased while the activities of PAL, PPO, and POD increased rapidly. Moreover, the accumulation of total phenolic compounds was enhanced, while the same coating application displayed potential effectiveness for the quality retention of fresh-cut bamboo shoots.
