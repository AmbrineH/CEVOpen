The sensory qualities of both coated and uncoated fruit stored at 10 °C declined during the storage period. Significant losses of linalool, limonene, and γ-terpinene content were prevented by the application of gum-Ag coatings and storage at 4 °C. Kinnow coated with the coating kept the sensory quality and fruit aroma for 120 d at a storage temperature of 4 °C.
