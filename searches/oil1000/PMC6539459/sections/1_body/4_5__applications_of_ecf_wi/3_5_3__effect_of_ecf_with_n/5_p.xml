<p class="p">According to Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B153-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>], samples of control (fresh fruit salad without silver-montmorillonite (Ag-MMT)), 10-NP (fruit salad with 10 mg of Ag-MMT), and 15-NP (fruit salad with 15 mg of Ag-MMT) exhibited signs of decay before the 20-NP (fruit salad with 20 mg of Ag-MMT) specimen, which were consistent with the microbiological results. The shelf life of each tested sample was calculated based on its sensorial and microbial qualities. This experiment found that 20 mg Ag-MMT NPs could maintain the sensorial characteristics of fresh fruit salad during prolonged storage time.
