 <sub class="sub">2</sub> film and PLA/BEO/nano-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> + nano-Ag film on their quality. Comparison results with PLA and PLA/BEO films indicated that PLA NC films successfully restricted adverse changes in total acidity, vitamin C content, and color, while firmness retention in the mangoes was enhanced. Moreover, PLA NC films inhibited the growth of microorganisms on the mango pericarp. The quality of mangoes exposed to the PLA NC films remained acceptable following prolonged storage periods, and results showed that the shelf life of these fruits was extended up to 15 d.
