 <xref rid="B152-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>] investigated the biochemical properties of vegetables following exposure to cellulosic packaging. The retention of freshness during storage was obtained by measuring the moisture content of the vegetables. Vegetables stored in packaging containing AgNPs were subjected to ethanol extracts and found to be rich in phenols, proteins, total antioxidants, and flavonoid content. However, being exposed to packaging containing AgNPs displayed no substantial impact on the nutritional profile of the vegetables.
