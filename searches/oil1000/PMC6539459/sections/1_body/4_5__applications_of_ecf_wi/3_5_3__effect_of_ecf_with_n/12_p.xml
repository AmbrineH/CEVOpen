This coating succeeded in preventing weight loss, while restricted PPO and POD activity in longan during storage. Moreover, by safeguarding the membrane structure against peroxidation, this coating substantially delayed the formation of MDA, obstructed the production of TA and restricted Vc loss in fruits. These effectiveness might lead to delay the senescence and decomposition of fruit.
