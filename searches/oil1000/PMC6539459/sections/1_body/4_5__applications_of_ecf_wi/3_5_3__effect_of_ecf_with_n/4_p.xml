 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production peak occurred after 7 d of storage, where the mangoes in the control sample produced the highest level of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Until day 33, minimal degradation was evident in the mangoes with CZ 0.5 coatings compared to samples without coatings. Compared with carrageenan coatings, adding ZnO NPs promoted weight loss in the fruit.
