 <xref rid="B86-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] established that the use of CS/nano-silica coating significantly delayed the browning and weight loss of loquat fruit, and maintained the titratable acid (TA) levels in the fruits. Moreover, PAL, PPO, and lipoxidase activity were effectively inhibited in the coated fruits. This coating might sufficiently extend the shelf life of loquat fruit with improving its chilling tolerance in the process.
