<p class="p">Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the preparation and various properties of ECF with NPs for the storage of fresh produce. The first part was to conclude the properties of several main coating materials and to introduce the preparation techniques of ECF with NPs reported by many researchers. In the next, the antimicrobial activities and mechanisms, physical and mechanical characterization of ECF with NPs were summarized. In addition, thermal stability, structural characteristics, and the properties including gas modification, induction defense and ion release of ECF with NPs were reviewed. Finally, its applications in the storage of fruits and vegetables were introduced and the useful insights for its further research were provided.</p>
