 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) are always used as an antimicrobial agent to coat different materials for further application in many food products [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The photocatalytic behavior of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is hugely relied on visible light irradiation, as well as UV light, which is responsible for activating its antimicrobial properties [
