<p class="p">Since not many studies are currently available involving the influence of ECF with NPs on the quality of fresh produce in storage. Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] examined harvested jujube to determine the combined effect of CS and nano-silicon on its quality characteristics. The quality indexes including decay incidence, weight loss, the red index, and respiration rate, exceeded those of the control samples after storage for 32 d at an ambient temperature. As reported by Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], by reducing the browning index, as well as obstructing polyphenol activity and the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), the film of CS/nano-silica significantly extended the longevity of fresh longan. They indicated that the CS/nano-silica coating showed promise for the quality preservation of fresh longan during prolonged storage.
