<p class="p">Some interesting works on preparation and property characterization of ECF with NPs have been conducted by researchers [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. As reported by Cano et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-based NPs were incorporated into the CS-based matrix to obtain different nano-biocomposites. Moreover, Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] found that the composite coating with graphene oxide (GO), CS and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs at the ratio 1:20:4 exhibited excellent antibacterial activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, which might induce the cell membrane rupture. Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] also showed that the Î²-CD-coated-Ag NPs reduced more than 99% 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> CFU compared to the control samples without silver addition. Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] indicated the incorporation of sulfur nanoparticles (SNP) could enhance the hydrophobicity, mechanical strength, and water vapor barrier property as well as antimicrobial activity of chitosan film. Furthermore, SNP capped with chitosan film exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</italic> with complete sterilization within 6 h and 12 h, respectively.
