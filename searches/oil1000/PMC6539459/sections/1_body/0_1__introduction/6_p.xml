<p class="p">In recent years, the preparation and application of ECF and nanostructured materials are increasing for extending the shelf life of fresh agricultural products. These research works have also been summarized by researchers. The different types of bio-based materials, their applications as packaging materials, and future trends were reviewed by Sorrentino et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Moreover, Dutta et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and Xing et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] have introduced the different prepared technologies, the antimicrobial activity and mechanism of chitosan based films. Falguera et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] also concluded the latest developments on the structures, active properties, and the application trends of edible coatings and films. Furthermore, Carbone et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] have reported the advanced technology by using AgNPs-doped edible polymers and oils to provide the preservation for food products. The applications of nanotechnology in the food industries had been concluded by Bajpai et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Moreover, the nanocomposite packaging materials from the views of properties, food applications and safety had also been reviewed by Sothornvit [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Although several edible-based coating and nanostructured materials were developed and applied in food packaging systems, until now, no detailed report has been published to summarize the preparation and various properties of ECF with antimicrobial NPs for the storage of vegetables and fruits.
