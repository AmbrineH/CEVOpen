<p class="p">High decay rates pose a significant challenge to the storage of fruits and vegetables leading to nutrient loss and the spread of microorganisms responsible for degradation [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], leading to huge fresh produce losses due to inappropriate storage conditions all over the world every year. Therefore, innovative technologies such as edible coatings and films (ECF) and controlled atmosphere packaging are suggested as possible solutions for maintaining the quality of agricultural products during storage and shelf time [
