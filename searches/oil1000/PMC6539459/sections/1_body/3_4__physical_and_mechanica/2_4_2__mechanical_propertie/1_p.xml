<p class="p">The operational qualities of ECF with NPs were essential for the application of CS-based coatings, to allow for analysis regarding the prevention of moisture loss in fresh produce. Cano et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] reported that CS matrices fortified by adding TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs significantly enhanced the tensile strength (TS) and the Youngâ€™s modulus (YM) impacting elongation at break (EB). Goudarzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] also indicated that water-vapor permeability (WVP) of starch/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NC exhibited a decline in the presence of high TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content of 0% to 1% and 3%, while an increase was evident when the TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content reached 5%. Moreover, TS of the starch/TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NC functioned independently from the TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content, while high TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content induced a rise in the EB and tensile energy to break (TEB). The addition of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the films prompted a minor rise in TS, as well as a reduction in EB. Teymourpour et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] determined that while moisture content, WVP, and oxygen permeability were reduced by addition of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the SSPS matrix, the process successfully enhanced the mechanical properties. The addition of REO and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> substantially increased the water resistance of WPI/CNFs composite films according to Alizadeh-Sani et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Additionally, the amalgamation of WPI/CNFs 7.5% films with both REO and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, displayed lower EB, and higher TS and YM. Research of Zolfi et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] suggested that adding TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs to kefiran-WPI films induced a substantial decline of TS and YM, and increased its EB. Goudarzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] established that although high TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content prompted a reduction in the TS and YM of the film samples, it induced a rise in both the EB and TEB. Moreover, Vejdan et al. [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>] determined that the WVP of the gelatin/agar-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> bilayers was reduced by the addition of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, while a rise in moisture content was evident with high nano-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content. Even though the TS in the bilayer films displayed an increase in conjunction with high nano-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content, a further increase prompted a reduction of the TS. According to Oleyaei et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], the addition of MMT and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> improved the EB and TS of the coatings, while the WVP displayed a decline [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Achachlouei et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] determined that the nanoclays enhanced the resilience of the NC to the YM and tensile stress of the films to the detriment of EB. A possible explanation for this contrasting behavior might be an oversaturation of the active polymer network points for silver adsorption. Usman et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] showed that the TS and YM of PVA varied significantly with the addition of GO, AgNPs and starch.
