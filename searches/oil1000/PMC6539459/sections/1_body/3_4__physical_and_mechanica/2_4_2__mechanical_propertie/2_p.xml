 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] characterized the FPI/FSG films containing basil leaf essential oil and ZnO. By adding ZnO NP, the TS displayed higher levels, while a reduction was evident in the EAB. The lowest WVP was achieved in the film containing 100% BEO and 3% ZnO NP. Arfat et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] determined that an increase in TS and a decrease in EB were characteristic of NC films containing 2% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) NPs. Additionally, Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] established that the TS of NC films containing CMC capped ZnO NPs appeared to be slightly higher than those that were uncapped. Furthermore, by adding ZnO NPs, the EB and WVP of gelatin films displayed a substantial increase. According to Meindrawana et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], the elongation limits of the carrageenan/ZnO (CZ) NPs NC film exhibited no significant increase compared to carrageenan film. Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] demonstrated that the moisture content, WVP, and EB of ZnO NPs modified films were higher than those in the control gelatin film. Akbariazam et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] revealed that adding 4% ZnO into the SSPS matrix enhanced the EB and heat seal strength of the films. Jebel and Almasi [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>] established that ZnO NPs improved the mechanical characteristics of BC films, while reduced WVP and moisture absorption. According to Nafchi et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], the introduction of low concentrations of the nanorod-rich ZnO (ZnO-N, the ZnO NPs formed in the presence of zinc nitrate) to starch solutions significantly decreased the WVP of the films. Hasheminya et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] indicated that an increase in the CuO NPs concentration improved the TS and decreased the WVP and EB of the kefiran-CMC coating film. Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>] showed that the SNP incorporation enhanced the mechanical strength and WVP of the CS film. Kadam et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] suggested that the mechanical properties of ZP films improved with the addition of TiO
