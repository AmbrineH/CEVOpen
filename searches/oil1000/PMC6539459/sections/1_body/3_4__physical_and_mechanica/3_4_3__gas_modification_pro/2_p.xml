<p class="p">The respiration rate of fruit pulps in the packaging system is related to the speed with which nutrients are consumed. Therefore, the decline in nutritious value occurs more slowly when the respiration rate is low (

 <xref rid="B139-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>] demonstrated that PLA as a transparent biopolymer exhibited the capacity for high gas permeability, which might depend on the integrity of the particular coating film, the number of micro-pores, the thickness of the coating, as well as the interaction between the coating polymer and the additives. Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] indicated that the SiOx dosage affected the micro-morphology and microstructure of CS coatings. Therefore, high nano SiOx content could induce significant aggregation and a coarse cross-section. Moreover, substantial hydrogen bonds might form between nano SiOx and CS molecules, while the reorganization of the CS structures could occur. As indicated by Chi et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], the permeability of the films was affected by the addition of NPs, which offered the possibility to further slow the respiration rate and reduce Vc consumption in pulps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01695-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The reason for this might be that fruit ripening was inhibited by the modification induced by NC films of the internal atmosphere such as ethylene, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Additionally, Roilo et al. [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>] established that the incorporation of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs decreased the film permeability by elevating the irregularity of the migration path. The sub-nanometer sizes of the empty spaces between the cellulose nanofibrils were closely related to the established barrier characteristics, as well as to the preferred transportation of small-sized penetrants [

 <xref rid="B146-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>]. Incorporating of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs had little change in the penetrant transport mechanism, while possible interface modifications and imperfections in the void structure influenced the penetrant diffusivity to a minimal extent. As a buffer against water vapor and critical gases O

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-loaded TO-CNF coatings offered a promising technical solution [

 <xref rid="B147-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. Meindrawana et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] determined that adding ZnO NPs to carrageenan coatings inhibited the gas exchange on fruit surfaces [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. In accordance with the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) results, a high concentration of ZnO NPs was evident in the coating material creating a high moisture barrier in the film. The accumulation of ZnO NPs during the formation of the coating material possibly affected the capacity of the coating material to act as a barrier. ZnO NPs contributed in restricting the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen during the respiration process. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] provided confirmation by establishing that the oxygen transmission rate of normal packaging exceeded that of ZnO NPs-based packaging. ZnO coatings with NPs exhibited selective gas permeability and reduced the exchange of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in fruit. Moreover, the ZnO NPs filler in the coating solution presented the ability to improve the barrier properties of the polymers by increasing pathway irregularity [
