<p class="p">Considering the XRD results obtained by Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], it was established that the reflections seen around 34.0° and 41.0° in CS/cellulose-AgNPs composite films were assigned to the (111) and (200) planes of the AgNPs face-centered cubic, which undoubtedly confirmed the presence of AgNPs. In the FTIR spectrum, Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] discovered formations of amide bonds between CS/cellulose-AgNPs CS/cellulose and the primary amino groups of CS, while the carboxylic residues corresponding to the silver surface were confirmed. Mathew and Kuriakose [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] believe that the encapsulation of AgNPs could further enhance the already improved light-fastening characteristics of the chromophoric system when attached to CS. Considering the XRD analysis of PVA/AgNPs and PVA/GO/AgNPs NC, Usman et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] determined that the characteristic peaks suggested the embedding of AgNPs in the related matrix. The intense OH band evident between 3550 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 3000 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the FTIR spectrum, was highly suggestive of H-bonding in the GO sheets at both intermolecular and intramolecular levels. A reduction in the intensity of peaks located at 1722 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 1421 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and 1370 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, indicated the disengagement of these vibrations due to AgNPs contact with the OH groups of PVA [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. In a PVA-GO-Ag-starch film, the movement that occurred on the OH stretching vibration peak, as well as the CO H stretching peak to a lower wave number signified substantial molecular interactions [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Moreover, Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] noted that the plasmon peak was visible around 405 nm, which could be ascribed to the development of pseudo-spherical AgNPs and corresponded to the surface resonance of these NPs. Both Abou-Okeil et al. [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>] and Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] indicated the interaction of chemisorption between the OH group in β-CD and the AgNP surface, which might be responsible for the loss of β-CD crystallinity.
