<p class="p">According to Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], the XRD patterns of the NC films containing various types of ZnO NPs displayed typical diffraction peaks, which provided confirmation that the crystalline ZnO NPs presented in the NC films. Furthermore, as reported by Arfat et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], XRD emphasized the presence of a change in the crystallinity of FSG films following the addition of NPs [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. During a microstructural analysis by Arfat et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], it was found that the presence of ZnO NP inhibited bilayer formation of a film containing 100% BEO. Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] utilized the FTIR spectrum to reveal contact between ZnO NPs and N-H groups of gelatin. According to Malini et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], the fluorescence emission intensity of nano ZnO was significantly higher than that of the NC, as evidenced by a blue shift (from 360 nm to 335 nm) in the UV-visible spectrum of NC.
