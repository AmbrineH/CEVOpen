<p class="p">The thickness of edible coating films is affected by the addition of NPs. Goudarzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] indicated that increased nano TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> content led to decreased film thickness. While contact between the nano filler and the polymer matrix might restrict water molecule distribution because of a tight network structure between TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and starch. According to Carvalho et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], a larger film thickness generated an increase in the diffraction peak intensity of the ZnO coating. Ortega et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] suggested that the AgNPs content induced a minor increase in the film thickness.
