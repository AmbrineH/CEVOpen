<p class="p">Cano et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] found that the contact angle increased to around 94° with the addition of 1 wt.% TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs, resulting in a more hydrophobic bio-NC. Then, the integration of higher levels of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs induced a reduction in the contact angle until it reached 83°. This efficacy was the result of the TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs addition that exceeded the threshold value, causing TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to be deposited on the bio-NC exterior, diminishing its irregularity. According to the study of Goudarzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], low TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (1 wt.%) was responsible for an increased contact angle of the starch-based NC, while elevated levels of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> of 3 wt.% caused the contact angle to decline. Shankar et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] found that higher water contact angle (WCA) values were the result of integrating hydrophobic ZnO NPs [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. Research results of Kadam et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] indicated that the initial contact angle of ZP films, both with and without TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs, produced diverse values that ranged from 19.6° to 25.3°, and from 17.9° to 22.8°, respectively.
