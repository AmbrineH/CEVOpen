<p class="p">SEM images generated by Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>] indicated that conducting pathways were established between Ti substrates and the corrosive medium by the microcracks and pores, while a coating with low permeability provided a more effective barrier against the penetration or transportation of chloride ions and water molecules. The primary particles seemed to be highly agglomerated with a substantial neck formation, and their sizes displayed a visible decline with elevated Ag content [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. These modifications in particle size and the distribution of ionic species with diverse Ag-doping levels were likely responsible for the differences in the morphology of β-Ca

 <xref rid="B142-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. Further, SEM images of iodinated composites examined by Banerjee et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], represented the petal-like structure typical of the CS matrix. TEM images signified the presence of spherical AgNP in the polymer, which denoted the generation of a stable AgNP-CS composite. Davoodbasha et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] reported that TEM observation of Ch3Ag1 (3% CS solution mixed with 1 mM of AgNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) exposed interlinked microporous structures with spherical AgNPs systematically dispersed within the matrix. A high probability existed that the Ag ions would have significant contact with the carbonyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups in the CS molecule for establishing structure uniformity. Usman et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] studied the SEM images of PVA/AgNPs NC, and suggested that spherical AgNPs particles were entrenched in the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix without any visible accumulation. Some aggregation was evident in PVA/GO/AgNPs NC, while the visibility of the GO stacking of the four-component NC system namely PVA/GO/AgNPs/starch was possibly due to the degradation process in conjunction with AgNPs distribution. According to Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], TEM micrographs of the β-CD stabilized AgNP displayed a comparatively narrow size distribution of pseudo-spherical particles. A red shift was apparent between the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks of AgNPs from both types of Ag-ZnO NPs, which corresponded with broader widths for (CD) material indicating an increase in particle size dispersion. Moreover, Ortega et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] suggested that AgNPs allowed for the matrix reinforcement of gelatinized starch, resulting in a more resilient material with smooth surfaces, as evidenced by SEM analysis.
