<p class="p">In recent years, nanosized particles as antimicrobial agents incorporated into edible coatings were the subject of many studies. However, additional research involving the interactions between nanosized particles and coating materials are necessary. Moreover, further works about the effect of these NP addition on the properties of coating materials properties should be understood. These investigation results might provide insights regarding further improvements to their physical and antimicrobial properties for practical applications.</p>
