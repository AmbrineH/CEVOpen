<p class="p">Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] have reported the preparation of CS-based coating with nano-silicon dioxide. Firstly, the mixed solution of CS, nano-silicon dioxide and deionized water was dispersed for 15 min by ultrasonication. Then, sucrose ester of fatty acid was added and dispersed for 5 min. The CS coating with nano-silicon dioxide was obtained after adding the glycerine and being dispersed. The CS solution with nano-silicon dioxide was prepared by Sun et al. [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and Song et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] had introduced a preparation technology of the CS/nano-silica coating film.
