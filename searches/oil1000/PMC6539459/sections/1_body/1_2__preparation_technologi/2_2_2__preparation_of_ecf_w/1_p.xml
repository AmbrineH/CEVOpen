 <xref rid="molecules-24-01695-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and introduced as follows. However, the uniform dispersion of NPs is a critical problem in the solution system. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01695-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the general technologies to prepare the ECF with NPs were summarized and reported, which includes several steps such as the surface modification of nanoparticles, coating materials dissolution, emulsion formation, and solvent evaporation. These preparations were conducted in order to solve the problem of NPs agglomeration and develop these complex coatings/films with high antimicrobial activity for application.
