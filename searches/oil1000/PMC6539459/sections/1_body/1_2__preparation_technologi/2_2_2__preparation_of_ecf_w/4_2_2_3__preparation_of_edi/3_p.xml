<p class="p">Composite films of fish protein isolate (FPI) and fish skin gelatin (FSG) blend incorporated with basil leaf essential oil (BEO) and ZnO nanoparticle (ZnONP) were prepared by Arfat et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Firstly, FPI was added with distilled water and homogenized for 1 min. Its pH was adjusted to 3. The obtained solution was filtered and adjusted the protein concentration. Then, glycerol was added as a plasticiser. The mixtures were stirred for 30 min at room temperature and used for preparing blend film-forming suspension (FFS). On the other hand, FSG powder was dissolved in distilled water. Then its pH was adjusted to 3 and then heated at 70 Â°C for 30 min. Afterward, glycerol was added and both FPI and FSG solutions were mixed. Moreover, ZnONP suspended previously in distilled water was added in this mixture. The obtained FPI/FSG/ZnONP suspension was stirred for 5 min and then homogenised for 30 s. Furthermore, BEO previously mixed with tween 20 was added to this above suspension. The film-forming suspension was obtained by homogenising and stirring.
