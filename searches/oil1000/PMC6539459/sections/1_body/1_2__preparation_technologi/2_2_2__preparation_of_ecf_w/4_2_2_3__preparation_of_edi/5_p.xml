This solution was used to prepare the SSPS dispersion. A mixture of sorbitol and glycerol was added to the formulation. Dispersions were heated to 75 ± 5 °C and stirred for 1 h. Then, the dispersions were cast on plates, dried at 25 °C and 50% RH in a humidity chamber. After peeled, the films stored in a closed desiccator containing saturated magnesium nitrate at 25 ± 2 °C and 50% ± 5% RH.
