Firstly, ZnO-N was dispersed in water stirred for 1 h and sonicated for another 30 min. This solution was used to prepare the aqueous starch dispersion. A mixture of sorbitol and glycerol were added. Starch nanocomposites were treated at 85 ± 5 °C for 45 min. After starch gelatinization completed, the solution was cooled to room temperature. Finally, the dispersion was cast on the plates and dried at 25 °C and 50% RH in a humidity chamber.
