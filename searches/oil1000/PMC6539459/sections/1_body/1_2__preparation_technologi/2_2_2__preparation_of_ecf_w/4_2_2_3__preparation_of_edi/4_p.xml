 <xref rid="B84-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] developed nanocomposite films of methyl cellulose (MC) incorporated with pediocin and ZnONP. ZnONP were mixed with deionized water and then sodium pyrophosphate was added. The ZnONP dispersion was sonicated for 23 min. Then, glycerol was added to the nanoparticle solution, which was heated at 80 ± 2 °C to solubilize the methyl cellulose. Pediocin was added to this solution with MC. Moreover, the gelatin/ZnONP film and carrageenan/ZnONP (CZ) based films were prepared by Shankar et al. [
