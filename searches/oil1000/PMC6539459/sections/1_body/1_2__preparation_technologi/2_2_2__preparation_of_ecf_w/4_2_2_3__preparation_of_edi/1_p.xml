CS was added and dissolved in an aqueous acetic acid solution. After silica particles added with stirring, the solution was poured onto a glass plate for drying. The dried membrane was immersed in an aqueous NaOH solution and kept for 2 h at 80 °C for dissolving the silica particles in order to generate a porous membrane. Afterwards, the porous membrane was washed with distilled water and then immersed in an aqueous glycerol solution for 30 min for removing the excess glycerol solution. Finally, film discs were cut and introduced in the suspension of nano ZnO in distilled water under stirring at 28 °C for 24 h. The CS/ZnO discs were separated, rinsed with distilled water and air dried.
