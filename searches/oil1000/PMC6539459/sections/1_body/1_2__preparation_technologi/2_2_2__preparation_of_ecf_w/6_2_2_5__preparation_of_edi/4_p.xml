<p class="p">Zein protein (ZP) nanocomposite films were prepared by Kadam et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. A film forming solution was prepared with ZP, aqueous ethanol, glycerol and PEG (polyethylene glycol)-600. The pH of the film-forming solution was then adjusted to 8.0. The solutions were heated to 62 ± 2 °C for 15 min under stirring and cooled to room temperature for 15 min. For ZP solutions with the core-and-shell NPs (TiO

After subjected to ultrasonication, the ZP with NPs solutions were cast on dishes and dried at ambient conditions (24 ± 1 °C) for 48 h. Afterwards, they were stored in 50 ± 2% RH chamber for 24 h before peeling.
