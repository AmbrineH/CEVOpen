Ag-Cu NPs with selected loadings were mixed well in distilled water; the dark grey colored suspensions were stirred for 5 min and further homogenization for 1 min. Then, gelatin powder was added into the above prepared Ag-Cu NPs suspensions and glycerol was added to the suspension under stirring. The final volume was adjusted to 100 mL using distilled water and heated at 70 Â°C for 30 min. The suspensions were sonicated for 30 min and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. After being degassed for 10 min by sonication, the NPs nanocomposite solution was obtained.
