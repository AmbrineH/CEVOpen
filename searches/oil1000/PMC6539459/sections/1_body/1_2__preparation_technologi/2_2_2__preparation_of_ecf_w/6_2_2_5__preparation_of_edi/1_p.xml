<p class="p">Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] had developed a Ag-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-CS nanocomposite as an antibacterial coating. After modification of CS, the CS adipate aqueous solution was prepared and mixed with AgNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solution. The mixture was stirred at 50 Â°C for 1 h. Meanwhile, TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs were dispersed in distilled water with sonication. Subsequently, the TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> dispersion was added into the Ag/CS adipate solution. The solution was treated with UV radiation for 10 min. The resulting Ag was deposited on the surface of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs and a complex was formed with CS via Ag-NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> coordination bonds through the amino groups on CS. On the other hand, Li et al. [

 <xref rid="B89-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] used the similar technology to prepare the CS/Ag/ZnO blend coating films.
