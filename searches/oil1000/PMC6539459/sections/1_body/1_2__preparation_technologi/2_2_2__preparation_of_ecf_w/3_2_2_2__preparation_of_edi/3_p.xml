<p class="p">AgNP stabilized with β-CD (AgNP-β-CD) was developed by Andrade et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The aqueous NaOH, aqueous glucose and aqueous β-CD solutions were mixed and heated. An aqueous AgNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> solution was dropwise after the solution reached to 60 °C. After that, the reaction product was dialyzed with deionized water. Then, the stabilized AgNPs were lyophilized and AgNP-β-CD powder was obtained.
