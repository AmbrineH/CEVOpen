 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Here introduces the prepared technology reported by Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Firstly, EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3′-dimethylamino-propyl] carbodiimide)/NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) was added to AgNPs solution with a carboxylate and the solution was incubated at 25 °C for 4 h with shaking. Then, the CS/cellulose film was submerged into the solution for 24 h with shaking. During the preparation process, the carboxyl groups of AgNPs were activated by EDC and NHS and subsequently reacted with the amino groups of CS in the composite film. Finally, the modified film was taken out and washed with the deionized water.
