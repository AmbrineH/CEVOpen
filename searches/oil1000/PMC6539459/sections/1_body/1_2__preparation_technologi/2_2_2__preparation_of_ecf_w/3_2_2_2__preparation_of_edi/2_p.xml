<p class="p">Starch-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-AgNPs film was prepared by Cano et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Firstly, starch was dispersed in an aqueous solution at 95 °C for 30 min with stirring. After homogenized, PVA was incorporated into the gelatinized starch dispersion and glycerol was added. Afterwards, starch-PVA film forming dispersions containing AgNPs were obtained by the reduction of silver nitrate using UV light. The films including PVA-GO-Ag-starch films had prepared by Usman et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. PVA was dissolved in DI water by heating at 90 °C for 1 h. GO suspension was made by adding GO flakes in DI water by ultra-sonication for 3~h. Both suspensions were mixed and stirred for 1~h. Then, starch and AgNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were added into the obtained solution and mixed. This solution was placed in an autoclave at 121 °C and 15 psi pressure for 1 h. Followed by cooling and casting onto glass petri dish were conducted and dried at room temperature for 3 d.
