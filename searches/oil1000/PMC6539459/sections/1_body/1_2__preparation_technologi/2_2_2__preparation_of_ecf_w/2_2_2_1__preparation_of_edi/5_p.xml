 <xref rid="B66-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] had prepared the WPI-based coating films with TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs. The preparation of WPI/cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) with TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs was introduced by Alizadeh-Sani et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] as follows. Firstly, TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs were added to WPI/CNFs solutions with stirring and sonication. Then, rosemary essential oil (REO) was added to the composite film solution and homogenized for 10 min. WPI/CNFs suspension with TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs and REO were cast onto a petri dish and then dried using vacuum oven at 30 ± 1 °C and 50 ± 6% RH for 24 h.
