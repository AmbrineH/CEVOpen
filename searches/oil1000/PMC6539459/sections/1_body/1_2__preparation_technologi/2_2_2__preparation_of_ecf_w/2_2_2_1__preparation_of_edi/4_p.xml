<p class="p">Teymourpour et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] had prepared SSPS biocomposites with nano TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> were first dispersed in deionized water and homogenized for 15 min. The obtained solutions were used to prepare the aqueous SSPS dispersions. A mixture of glycerol and sorbitol was prepared and added. SSPS nanocomposites were treated at 85 °C for 1 h. After the solution cast on Preplex plates fitted, the films were dried at 25 °C and 50% relative humidity (RH). After being peeled, the dried films were stored at 25 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5% RH. Furthermore, the TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/SSPS composite films were also prepared by Salarbashi et al. [
