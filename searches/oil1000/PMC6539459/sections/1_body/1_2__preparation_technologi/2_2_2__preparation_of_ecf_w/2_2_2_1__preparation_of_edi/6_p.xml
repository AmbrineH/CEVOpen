<p class="p">The CMC-well-dispersed ternary nanocomposite coating films containing sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT)-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was developed by Achachlouei et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Firstly, Nano-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> powder and ternary nanocomposite films containing Na-MMT were dispersed in distilled water with stirring and sonicating, respectively. Then, CMC was added to distilled water (95 °C) and mixed for 1 h. The Na-MMT and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sonicated solutions were added into the CMC solution, respectively. After glycerol was combined and stirred for 15 min, the solutions were cooled at room temperature. The obtained solutions were cast onto a polystyrene petri-dish and dried at 50 °C for 30 h in an oven.
