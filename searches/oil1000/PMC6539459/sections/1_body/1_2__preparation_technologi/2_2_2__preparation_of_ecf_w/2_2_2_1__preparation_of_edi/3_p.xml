<p class="p">Oleyaei et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] have prepared potato starch film with sodium montmorillonite (MMT) and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Firstly, starch was mixed with distilled water and glycerol at room temperature (25 °C) for 5 min. This suspension was treated at 90 °C for 30 min and agitated. Then, MMT and TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> were dispersed separately in distilled water by sonication for 60 min at room temperature and were added to the aqueous dispersion of starch. The mixture was continuously stirred for 10 min. After being vacuumed to remove air bubbles from solutions, the solution was poured into a polystyrene tray and dried at 60 °C for 15 h in an oven.
