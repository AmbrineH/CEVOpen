<p class="p">Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] developed a CS/WPI film incorporated with modified TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs. Firstly, CS, sodium laurate-modified TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> NPs and glycerin were added into an acetic acid solution and stirred for 2 h. Then, WPI was dispersed in deionized water. These two solutions were mixed and the mixture was adjusted to pH 3. After being stirred and degassed under vacuum, the obtained solution was casted over the plastic Petri dish and dried at 60 Â°C in oven for 16 h. On the other hand, the TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/plasticized CS nanobiocomposites and the graphene oxide-chitosan (GO-CS)-TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> coating were prepared by Cano et al. [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] with the similar technology having a little modifications, respectively.
