<p class="p">Composed of a linear series of sulfated galactans, carrageenan is a hydrocolloid extracted from red algae. It is a water-soluble, natural product with the potential to be employed as a film-forming substance [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01695" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The number and location of a sulfated ester on 3,6-anhydro-d-galactose residues determine the specific classification of the galactans. Similar to other hydrocolloid-based films, they display inadequate water-vapor-barrier properties [
