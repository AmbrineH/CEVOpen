<p class="p">Polycyclic glucose oligosaccharides known as cyclodextrins (CDs) are composed of 6, 7 or 8 glucopyranose units connected with β-1,4-glucosidic bonds referred to as α-, β-, or γ- cyclodextrin, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01695-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> illustrates β-CD molecules consisting of a hydrophilic exterior with hydroxyl groups, as well as a hydrophobic central cavity. By forming inclusion complexes that are water soluble, low polarity and non-polar molecules displaying suitable shape and size are allowed to solubilize [
