<p class="p">To effectively maintain the storage quality and prolong the shelf life of fresh products, the novel ECF containing different NPs was developed increasingly as a convenient technique. In this paper, the properties of main edible-based coating materials were first introduced. Then, the ECF with NPs such as TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, Ag, and ZnO developed by other researchers was reviewed. The antimicrobial activity of ECF with NPs against the tested microorganism were observed by researchers. Several antimicrobial mechanisms including the electrostatic interaction between the cationic polymer or free metal ions and the charged cell membrane, the photocatalytic reaction of NPs and the detachment of free metal ion are summarized and introduced. Thereafter, a discussion was included on the surface structure, and mechanical properties of ECF with NPs, which are crucial for its applications of fruits and vegetables during storage at refrigerated or room temperatures. The properties including gas modification, induction defense and ion release of ECF with NPs were also discussed. On the other hand, results from additional works indicated that the applications of ECF with different NPs might provide a suitable and effective way to prevent the quality loss in postharvest fruits and vegetables. More importantly, additional research involving the interactions between nanosized particles and coating materials, and the antifungal mechanism inducted by UV or visible light require for further investigation. The works on the prepared and used standards and the safety of these coatings also need to be carried out in the future.
