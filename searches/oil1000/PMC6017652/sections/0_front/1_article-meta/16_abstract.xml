  <italic class="italic">Dendranthema indicum</italic> var. 
  <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic>, which is an aromatic plant with a strong and special fragrance throughout the whole plant, is used for the treatment of colds and headaches, and as a mosquito repellant in Shennongjia, Hubei province, China. To analyze the composition of the essential oil from this medicinal herb, we developed a gas chromatography-mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) method including microwave-assisted extraction, hydrodistillation and direct headspace analysis in two different stationary phase columns. In total, 115 volatile compounds were identified, of which 90 compounds were identified using Rxi-5MS and 78 using HP-INNOWAX. Our results revealed that the oil was mainly composed of five categories of compound: oxygenated monoterpenes (28.76–78.10%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (4.27–38.06%), sesquiterpenes (3.22–11.57%), fatty hydrocarbons (1.65–9.81%) and monoterpenes (0–3.32%). The major constituents are α-thujone, β-thujone, 
  <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-sabinol, sabinyl acetate and (-)-neointermedeol.However, the essential oil composition in the published literature differs significantly. Therefore, a cluster analysis was carried out using the top ten compositions in the reported literature as well as this study, using Minitab software. To provide detailed information on plant origin, the ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 region was amplified and sequenced (Accession No. MF668250). Besides, in order to provide a macroscopic view of the chemical composition, the biosynthetic pathway of the main components was summarized according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and the published literatures.
