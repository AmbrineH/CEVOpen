<p class="p">Recently, the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) technique has been widely employed in the extraction of active compounds from plants due to its superior performance in terms of its extraction yields, solvent consumptions and extraction time [

In addition, microwave heating has certain advantages compared to conventional heating that are related not only to the rapid microwave heating rate but also to the non-uniformity of the local applied electric field, which serves to accelerate temperature homogeneity within the material [

However, this method is time-consuming and has other disadvantages such as thermal degradation and hydrolysis of heat-sensitive volatile constituents.
