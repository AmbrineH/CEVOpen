<p class="p">In this study, three methods—MAE, HD, and headspace (HS) sampling—were used to extract essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic>, and Rxi-5MS and HP-INNOWAX capillary columns were used to analyze the constituent compounds. Compound composition was presented with GC-MS normalization results. After identifying the main components, we found that there are significant differences between the published results, even in the top ten compounds. Therefore, we carried out a cluster analysis between our results and the published essential oil compositions for 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">C. indicum</italic>) using Minitab software. In order to provide detailed information about the plant origin, we amplified and sequenced the ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 genomic region. We also summarized and discussed the biosynthetic pathway of the main components.
