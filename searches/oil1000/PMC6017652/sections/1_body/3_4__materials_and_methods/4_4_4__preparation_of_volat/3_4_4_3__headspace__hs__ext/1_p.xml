<p class="p">HS extraction of the volatile components of each sample was performed on an Hss 15A (BCT, Willst채tt, Germany) equipped with a headspace auto-sampler, heater, and agitator. The headspace equilibrium temperature was set at 90 째C for 15 min, with gentle shaking. The loop and transfer line temperature were set as 100 째C and 110 째C, respectively. The pressurization time and the loop fill time were 0.2 min, and the injection time was 0.2 min. </p>
