<p class="p">The MAE experiments were carried out in a CEM MARS 6microwave oven (Boston, MA, USA). 1.0 g samples of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic> powder were placed in a microwave extraction tank with 10 mL hexane. The power of microwave digestion was adjusted to 800 W and the program was set as follows: Temperature increased to 100 °C in 10 min and maintained for another 30 min [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Due to the limited scale of the extraction, the extraction procedure was repeated 10 times, and the extracts were combined and concentrated at room temperature under vacuum. The moisture in the sample was eliminated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and then the dehydrated sample was placed in a sealed glass bottle and stored at 4 °C until used.
