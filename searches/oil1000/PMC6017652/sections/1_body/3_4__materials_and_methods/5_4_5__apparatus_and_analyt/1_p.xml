<p class="p">The GC-MS analysis of each sample was carried out on a Shimadzu (TQ-8040) series GC-MS system (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an AOC-20i auto-sampler. The columns used were (1) an Rxi-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm) (Bellefonte, PA, USA), stationary phase: 5% two phenyl, 95% two methyl polysiloxane; and (2) an HP-INNOWAX capillary column (30m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm) (PaloAlto, CA, USA), stationary phase: 100% polyethyleneglycol. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The column temperature was initially programmed at 40 °C for 3 min and increased to 90 °C at 3 °C/min and held for 4 min, then to 115 °C at 3 °C/min and held 10 min, and to 140 °C at 2 °C/min and held for 8 min, and finally to 210 °C at 3°C/min and held 5 min. Injector and detector temperatures were 210 °C. The ionization energy was 70 eV with a scan time of 0.3 s and a mass range of 45–500 AMU. The management of the GC-MS system, parameter settings for GC and mass spectrometry, and data receipt and processing were performed using Shimadzu GC-MS solution ver.4 software (Tokyo, Japan). The compounds were identified using two methods. One of the methods was based on a comparison of their mass spectra with data in NIST 14 and 14s (National Institute of Standards and Technologies, Mass Spectra Libraries) [
