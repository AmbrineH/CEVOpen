<p class="p">Fresh leaf tissues were ground into a fine powder with liquid nitrogen, then DNA was extracted using a Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 μL of extracted DNA was used as the template for PCR amplification, with 10 μL 2× Taq master premix, 2 μL 10 mM ITS1 primer (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and 2 μL 10 mM ITS4 primer (5′-TCCTCCGCTT ATTGATATGC-3′), in a final volume of 20 μL. The amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s (30 cycles); 72 °C for 10 min (1 cycle). 5 μL PCR product was applied to a 1% agarose gel containing GoldView dye and electrophoresis was carried out for 20 min at 150 V followed by observation under UV light in a Tenon gel imaging system. After confirmation of a strong, single amplified band of about 500 bp, the PCR product was sent for Sanger sequencing using ITS1, ITS2-F (5′-CTTTCGATGGACGCACGAAC-3′) and ITS4 as sequencing primers. Sequences were confirmed by comparing with the original sequencing chromatogram and were connected using Seqman software (Madison, MI, USA).</p>
