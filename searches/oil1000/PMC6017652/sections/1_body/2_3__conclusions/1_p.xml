<p class="p">In this study, MAE, HD and HS methods were used to extract essential oil from air-dried 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic> and the samples were analyzed in two capillary columns with different polarities (Rxi-5MS and HP-INNOWAX). A total of 115 constituents were identified, belonging to five main categories:oxygenated monoterpenes, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpenes, fatty hydrocarbons and monoterpenes. The major constituents of the essential oil are α-thujone, β-thujone, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-sabinol, sabinyl acetate and (+)-neointermedeol. Our results demonstrate that the main components of oil obtained using the different methods are generally in accordance with each other. However, different low-content components could be detected in the oil using the two different columns and the three different extraction methods. In order to provide a macroscopic view of essential oil biosynthesis, we constructed a biosynthetic pathway of the main compounds according to the KEGG database and published literature. Cluster analysis was carried out using the top ten compounds from previous publications and our results. This demonstrated that there were marked differences in the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic> essential oil reported by different research groups. In order to provide detailed information about the origin of the plant used in the present work, the complete ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 genomic region was amplified from plant DNA and sequenced. This sequence can be used by other researchers to confirm whether their plant specimens have the same origin as ours or not.
