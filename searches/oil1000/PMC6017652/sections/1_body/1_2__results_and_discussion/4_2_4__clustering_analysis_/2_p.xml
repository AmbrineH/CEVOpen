<p class="p">There are remarkable differences in the composition of

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00576" class="xref">Table S2</xref>) and a matrix was made, followed by analysis with the maximum likelihood method (Minitab software), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00576-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Our analysis demonstrated that there were three main clades, and the similarity ranged from 43.40% to 84.35%.It is interesting to note that 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. indicum</italic> are clustered in the same clade (D-S-5, C-F-F-14, C-D-F-14 and C-F-13). Samples were collected at three closely related locations in Hubei Province [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]—Hongping (D-1-F-4), Xingshan (D-2-F-4) and Badong (D-3-F-4)—were clustered into the same clade. The sample used in this study (named D-H) was clustered with D-L-11, D-F-11 and D-S-11, which suggested that these plants had a closely related origin. The essential oil composition of different tissues from the same plant clustered within the same clade (for example, 65.24% similarity between D-L-11, D-F-11 and D-S-11; and 84.35% similarity between D-B-12 and D-F-12). The significant differences between the previous reports as well as our results might be due to differences in the tissues collected, drying method, collection time, growing environment, and the methods of transportation and extraction.
