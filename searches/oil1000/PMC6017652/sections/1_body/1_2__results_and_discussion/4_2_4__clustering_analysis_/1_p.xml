<p class="p">Liu et al. first identified the existence of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic> in 1983, and identified α-thujone, β-thujone and borneol as the main components [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], which is in accordance with the main components in this study. However, Lu and Li identified 44 compounds in HD oil from air-dried flower using GC-MS, and the main components were 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol (3.40%), 1,8-cineole (3.20%), β-sesquiphellandrene (3.14%), and verbenone (3.10%), while α-thujone (0.77%), β-thujone (0.43%), and 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-sabinol (0.64%) were minor components [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Gas chromatography-Quadrupole-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (GC-Q-TOF/MS) was used by Wang et al. to identify components of the essential oil from flower, stem and leaves [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In total, 162 compounds were identified using the headspace method. The main components were bornyl acetate (15.40%), α-phellandrene (14.18%), p-cymene (9.64%), camphor (9.54%), β-linalool (8.61%), and α-thujone (7.06%) in flowers; 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-β-farnesene (17.95%), germacrene D (12.89%),β-phellandrene (12.70%), β-caryophyllene (10.18%), and bicyclogermacrene (8.01%) in stem tissue; and p-cymene (20.42%), bornyl acetate (20.41%), α-phellandrene (13.67%), and β-linalool (5.46%) in leaves [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In another study, ethanol extraction followed by petroleum partition was used to extract the essential oil, and using this method, 63 compounds were identified from freeze-dried stem and leaves [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The main components were 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-linalool oxide (9.94%), β-sitosterol (4.48%), pentatriacontane (3.47%), dibutyl phthalate (3.35%), and amyrin (3.26%).
