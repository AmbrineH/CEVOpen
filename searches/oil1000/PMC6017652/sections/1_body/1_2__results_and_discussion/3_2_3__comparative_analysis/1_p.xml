<p class="p">The distribution of identified compounds from the two columns and the three different extraction methods is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00576-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Using the Rxi-5MS column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00576-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A), 90 compounds were identified in total, and they accounted for 75.83%, 69.53% and 86.01% of the compounds in the essential oil obtained with the HD, MAE, and HS extraction methods, respectively. Twenty-four of the compounds were common to all three extraction methods. A similar result was also observed when using the HP-INNOWAX column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00576-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). However, there were also specific components in the oil extracted using the different methods. From the Rxi-5MS analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00576-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A), there were 11 specific compounds in the HD sample, accounting for 4.4% of the compounds in the HD oil (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00576" class="xref">Table S1</xref>); 10 specific compounds accounting for 8.87% in the MAE oil; and 11 specific compounds accounting for 1.23% in the HS oil. These results suggest that the identity of the major components can be determined by any extraction method used in this study, and the utilization of different extraction methods increases the number of minor components that can be identified.
