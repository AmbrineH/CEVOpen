 <xref rid="molecules-23-00576-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes the main constituents in the essential oil obtained from the different methods using the two columns. The Rxi-5MS column detected more compounds than the HP-INNOWAX column and the main constituents are in accordance with each other, even though the percentages of the main compounds differed: α-thujone (12.01–39.3%), neointermedeol (2.13–19.41%), β-thujone (5.4–16.91%), and sabinyl acetate (4.58–7.7%). As we know, essential oils play an important role in communication between plants and environmental factors, and many components also have a high medicinal value. Elucidation of the main composition of essential oil will provide useful information for confirming the therapeutic compounds.
