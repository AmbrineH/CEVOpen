 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00576-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>C, 79 compounds in total were identified in the HD oil using the two columns. Of these, 41 compounds were identified with both columns, accounting for 88.79% of the compounds identified using Rxi-5MS and 88.73% of those identified using HP-INNOWAX. In addition, a number of specific components were identified using the individual columns: 22 compounds accounting for 6.35% in the Rxi-5MS column and 17 compounds accounting for 5.53% in the HP-INNOWAX column. Similar results were observed for the MAE oil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-00576-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>E). These results demonstrate that the major components can be identified in either of the columns used here, and more minor components can be identified using columns with different polarities. These results suggest that the coverage of the essential oil composition is different using different methods and columns, and a variety of extraction methods and columns should be considered in order to comprehensively determine the composition of an essential oil.
