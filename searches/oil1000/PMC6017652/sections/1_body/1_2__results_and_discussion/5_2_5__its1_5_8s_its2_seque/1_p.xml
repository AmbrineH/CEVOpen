<p class="p">The origin of the plant can also be an important factor, due to the highly similar morphological characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">C. indicum</italic>). Therefore, in order to provide detailed genetic reference information for the identification of the plant material used in this study, the complete ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 genomic region was amplified using ITS1 and ITS4 primers and then sequenced (Genbank accession number MF668250). A sequence comparison was carried out using the Blastntool from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)website, and it showed that MF668250 had 100% similarity with the existing sequence (KC694206.1) from 
 <italic class="italic">C. indicum</italic> isolate I_SN3_12 [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-00576" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], which was collected from Yanzi-Gap (Shennongjia, Hubei Province, China), according to information supplied to us by the authors. After detailed comparison of photographs, growing environment, and specimens, combined with the results of our analysis, we together concluded that the samples used in the present study and the 1-SN3-12 isolate are both 
 <italic class="italic">D. indicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">aromaticum</italic>.
