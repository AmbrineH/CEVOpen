 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-23-00576" class="xref">Table S1</xref> showed that the essential oil was mainly composed of five categories of compound: Oxygenated monoterpenes (28.67–78.10%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (4.27–38.06%), sesquiterpenes (3.22–11.57%), fatty hydrocarbons (1.65–9.81%) and monoterpenes (0–3.32%). There were differences in the chemical composition of the essential oil obtained by the different extraction methods and analyzed using the different columns. Comparing the proportions of the different compound categories, the sample obtained by HS analysis contained the highest level of oxygenated monoterpenes (77.27% for Rxi-5MS and 78.10% for HP-INNOWAX) and monoterpenes (3.32% for Rxi-5MS and 0.98% for HP-INNOWAX), but the lowest level of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (4.27% for Rxi-5MS and 9.17% for HP-INNOWAX). These results for the HS oil can be explained by the lower extraction temperature (90 °C), the shorter extraction time (20 min) and the sealed system, under which compounds with a lower boiling point are easily released and maintained in the system, with little loss. In the MAE oil, the proportion of monoterpenes (0.74% for Rxi-5MS and 0% for HP-INNOWAX) and oxygenated monoterpenes (36.38% for Rxi-5MS and 28.67% for HP-INNOWAX) was lowest. This might be due to the solvent recycling process in MAE, during which compounds with a low boiling point are partially lost due to the application of vacuum conditions. For the HD method, the extraction temperature was the same as that in MAE, but for a much longer time (4 h), and therefore the percentage of sesquiterpenes with a higher boiling point was highest in the HD oil (11.57% for Rxi-5MS and 6.99% for HP-INNOWAX). In the HD sample, the proportion of monoterpenes (1.82% for Rxi-5MS and 0.62% for HP-INNOWAX) and oxygenated monoterpenes (52.12% for Rxi-5MS and 46.73% for HP-INNOWAX) was higher than MAE but lower than HS, because of the partial loss due to the open system.
