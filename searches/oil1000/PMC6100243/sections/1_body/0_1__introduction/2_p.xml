<p class="p">Previous studies have been dedicated to the chemical constituents of essential oils of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> growing within Russia, in particular, the Krasnoyarsk region [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], Irkutsk region [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], and Mongolia [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. One study also provided detailed information about the essential oils extracted from the roots of plants growing in China [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The fatty acid constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic>’s roots from Russia (Republic of Buryatia) and Mongolia, as well as 
 <italic class="italic">B. chinense</italic> from China, have been reported in [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Additionally, the chemical composition of lipids from ten 
 <italic class="italic">Bupleurum</italic> species has been given in a range of papers from Turkey [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and the leaf and seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">B. lancifolium</italic> from Iran [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, studies of essential oil composition were generally incomplete and related to plants growing in scattered populations. Furthermore, the lipid fraction of the aerial part of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> has yet to be studied. The lipid fraction constituents for 
 <italic class="italic">Bupleurum scorzonerifolium</italic> Willd., the species growing within Russia (Republic of Buryatia, Trans–Baikal territory), and Mongolia, are reported in this study for the first time. In this study, we investigated and conducted a comparative analysis of the essential oils and lipid fraction of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> from different habitats and tried to establish some possible relationships between the chemical composition and environmental differences.
