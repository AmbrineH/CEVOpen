<p class="p">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was carried out to determine the composition of the essential oils using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an HP 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.2 μm; Hewlett-Packard). MS was carried out with the electron impact at 70 eV and the electron multiplier set at 2200 V. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The column temperature was set from 50 to 240 °C. The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 50 to 240 °C, increasing at a rate of 4 °C/min with an initial hold for 5 min, and then from 240 to 280 °C, increasing at a rate of 20 °C/min with a final hold for 5 min. The injector and detector temperatures were 280 and 250 °C, respectively. The purity of the helium gas was 99.999%. The column pressure was set to 52.8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> Pa. The split ratio was 60:1.
