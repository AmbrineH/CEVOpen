<p class="p">In order to determine the composition of the lipid fraction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph with a 7000C triple quadrupole mass spectrometer as the detector and an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.2 µm; Hewlett-Packard). Helium (99.999% purity) was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate 1.5 mL/min. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: it was kept at a constant of 125 °С for 0.5 min, from 125 °C to 320 °C (at rate of 7 °C/min), and kept constant at 320 °C for 0.5 min. The injector and detector temperatures were set to 280 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The split ratio was adjusted to 40:1. The MS data were acquired in scanning mode at a speed of 2.5 s per scan.</p>
