<p class="p">The percent composition of the lipid fraction derivatives was calculated from the GC peak areas relative to the total peak area based on the GÐ¡-MS analyses of the lipid fraction. Qualitative analysis was based on comparing the retention times and total mass spectra of the corresponding pure compounds using NIST14.L and standard mixtures of Bacterial Acid Methyl Esters (CP Mix, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (Supelco, 37 compounds, FAME Mix, 10 mg/mL in CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). Iso-, antheiso, 2-OH- fatty acids are indicative of bacteria and microscopic fungi and can often be found among plant fatty acids (database
