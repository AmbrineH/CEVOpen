 <xref rid="molecules-23-01496-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis using principal component analysis (PCA). All statistical analysis were conducted using the Sirius software ver. 6.0 (Pattern Recognition Systems, Bergen, NORWAY) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Compounds found in all or the majority of the samples were subjected to statistical analysis, and their relative values (i.e., percentage of the sum) were logarithmically transformed. This process allowed us to derive an equation that could be used to define quantitative differences among individual compounds. As a scaling method, the unit or unit variance scaling was applied, which is common and uses the standard deviation as the scaling factor [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The model was leave one out cross validated. The standard deviation from the average values of the amounts of lipid fraction components was calculated using the Excel 2013 software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) package.
