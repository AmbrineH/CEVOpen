 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). A total of 25 mL of chloroform and 29 mL of distilled water were added to the total extract. Chloroform and waterâ€“methanol layers were divided with a separation funnel. The chloroform layer was evaporated under reduced pressure in an IR-50LT rotary evaporator (Labtex, Moscow, Russia) and the extracted lipid fraction was weighed. All experiments were done in triplicate and the results were expressed on the basis of air-dry weight.
