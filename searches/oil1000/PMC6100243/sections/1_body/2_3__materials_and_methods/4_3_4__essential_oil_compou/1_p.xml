<p class="p">Essential oil constituents were identified by comparing their mass spectra with standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and with calculated linear retention indices (RIs) in the literature [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01496" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The RIs were obtained by co-injection with a mixture of linear C

 <sub class="sub">20</sub> hydrocarbons (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Identification was approved when computer matching with the mass spectral libraries had a probability above 90%. The contents of the oil components were identified by the relative amount (%) of the individual oil components and were expressed as a percentage peak area relative to the total peak area based on the GС-MS analyses of the oils.
