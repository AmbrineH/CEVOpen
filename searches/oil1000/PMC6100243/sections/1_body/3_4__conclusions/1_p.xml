<p class="p">This work investigated the chemical composition of the essential oils and lipid fraction of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> from different habitats. Compared with previous studies, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ocimene, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-ocimene, limonene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-copaene, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-elemene, caryophyllene oxide were consistent components of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium,</italic> regardless of habitat. Their content varied from traces to significant amounts. It was shown that the aridity of the area facilitated a higher content of the humulane, caryophullane, and muurolane types of sesquiterpenes, monocyclic sesquiterpenes, and bicyclic sesquiterpenes with a cyclopropane ring. For this reason, intensifying biosynthesis could be assumed as a probable underlying mechanism of this relation. For the first time, the chemical constituents of the lipid fraction extracted from the aerial part of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> from the Republic of Buryatia, Trans–Baikal region, and Mongolia were investigated by GC-MS. 16:0, 18:2n9 and 18:1n9 were identified as the major fatty acids. According to the results, the lipid fraction of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> predominantly contained MUFA and PUFA, which confirmed the pharmacological value of the species. It is probable that the main factors affecting the composition of essential oils and lipid fractions of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerofolium</italic> are environmental ones that determine the moisture conditions at the sites inhabited by 
 <italic class="italic">Bupleurum</italic> plants. To verify this assumption and for a better understanding of the compounds’ synthesis, studies of other 
 <italic class="italic">Bupleurum</italic> species from semiarid and arid territories of Asia should be conducted in the future.
