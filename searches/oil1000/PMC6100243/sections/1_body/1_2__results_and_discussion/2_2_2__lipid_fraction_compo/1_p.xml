<p class="p">The extracted lipid fractions were solid, viscous, had a dark green color and a pleasant smell. The volume varied from 2.73 to 9.38% being non-identical in the different habitats of plants (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01496-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The composition of lipids was determined by GC-MS. In total, 23 components were identified in 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic>’s lipid fraction including 20 fatty acids, two sterols, and one ketone (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01496-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The major fatty acids identified in the lipid fraction from the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> were 16:0, 18:2n9, and 18:1n9. The total content of the above-mentioned fatty acids reached up to 76.19% (sample No. 14). They were also dominant in the aerial part of other

The dominant PUFA was diene acid 18:2n9 (20.17–31.95%). Fatty acid 16:3n7 (up to 4.63%) was found in a significant amount, while 18:3n6 and 20:3n8 (up to 2%) were minor. The content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was in the range of 18.60–33.64%. The dominant MUFA was 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>18:1n9, with the highest percentage in sample No. 5 (30.18%) and the lowest percentage was No. 7 (15.11). The content of 16:1n9 was around 0.64–2.32%. 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>18:1n9 and 20:1n1 were found in minor amounts.
