<p class="p">The samples from the most continental territories (namely, the Republic of Buryatia, Trans–Baikal territory and Mongolia) of semiarid and arid regions of Asia were grouped in a single cluster on the biplot. These populations were characterized by high contents of humulane, caryophyllane, muurolane types of sesquiterpenes, monocyclic sesquiterpenes, and bicyclic sesquiterpenes with a cyclopropane ring. Samples from territories with a higher level of precipitation and more temperate conditions (Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk regions) were grouped on the right side of the biplot. The samples from Krasnoyarsk were focused in the upper side of the chart. These samples were characterized by high levels of cadinane and bisabolane types of sesquiterpenes, alcohols, phenylpropanoids, acyclic and thujane monoterpenes. Samples from the Irkutsk region were located in the lower part and predominantly contained the guaiane type of sesquiterpenes. Thus, we could assume that
