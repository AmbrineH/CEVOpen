The first choice for most data is an orthogonal projection on the plane of the two principal components (PC1, PC2, or PC3). The projection plane is essentially a planar two-dimensional screen positioned such that the data are displayed with the smallest distortions. Despite that, PC1 and PC2 explained a little over 50% of the total variance as they were chosen from three extracted combinations. In particular, these components contained specific variables which showed that the samples were divided into groups according to the geographical location with Lake Baikal as a natural boundary between them (

For instance, the Republic of Buryatia, Trans–Baikal region, and Mongolia are located to the east side of Lake Baikal, while the Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk regions are to the west. The climate of Siberia and its cross-border Mongolia is sharply continental. The great extent and great difference in the geography determine the variability of climates of individual regions of this territory. For instance, climatic differences between the western and eastern regions of Siberia are prominent. The climate of Eastern Siberia (Irkutsk region, Buryatia region, and Trans–Baikal region) is generally more continental, while the territory of Western Siberia (including the Krasnoyarsk region) is milder and has more precipitation. The main reason for these differences is that wet air masses from the Atlantic Ocean become increasingly weaker in the course of transferring through Europe and Siberia. As a result, they only have residual influence on the climate in the Irkutsk region, and almost do not affect the climate of areas in the Republic of Buryatia located to the east of the mountains that surround Lake Baikal. Due to this, a large part of the Buryatia region is characterized by a semiarid climate. At the same time, the huge water body of Lake Baikal markedly modifies climatic conditions on the coastal areas, significantly smoothing out diurnal temperature changes and even seasonal ones. To the east and south from Buryatia, namely, in the Trans–Baikal region and Mongolia, the climate is more continental and arid.
