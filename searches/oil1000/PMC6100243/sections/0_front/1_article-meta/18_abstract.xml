 <p class="p">The essential oils and lipid fraction extracted from the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">Bupleurum scorzonerifolium</italic> were determined by a GC-MS method. In total, up to 67 components were identified.

  <italic class="italic">β</italic>-elemene, and caryophyllene oxide were recognized as consistent components of the essential oil extracted from the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic>, regardless of the habitat. The content of these components varied from traces to a significant amount. The volume of the lipid fraction varied from 2.73 to 9.38%. In total, 23 components were identified, including 20 fatty acids, two sterols, and one ketone. The major fatty acid components identified were 16:0, 18:2n9, and 18:1n9. The total content of these fatty acids reached up to 76.19%. The lipid fraction of the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> predominantly contained MUFA and PUFA, which confirmed the pharmacological value of the species. The main factors affecting the composition of essential oils and lipid fractions of 
  <italic class="italic">B. scorzonerifolium</italic> are environmental ones that determine the moisture supply to the plants in semiarid and arid areas.
