<p class="p">The previously mentioned studies augmented the supply of the substrate FDP, which is further catalyzed in the terpene pathway by a terpene synthase (TPS), performing complex reactions that yield sesquiterpenes with precise structure and stereochemistry [
 <xref rid="B19-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In the biosynthesis of khusimol, the TPS is the ZS that catalyzes the cyclization of FDP to the tricyclic (+)-zizaene. Its enzymatic characterization has been described by a recombinant codon-optimized variant fused to the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), which increased the solubility of ZS and expressed heterologously in
