<p class="p">As an alternative to raise the FDP supply, the heterologous MEV pathway was engineered in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> by Keasling and co-workers for the in vivo production of amorpha-4,11-diene [
 <xref rid="B17-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The heterologous pathway involved the cloning of eight genes from 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> into two operons: MevT operon converted acetyl-CoA to mevalonate and MBIS operon catalyzed mevalonate to IPP and DMAPP that led to FDP, yielding 112.2 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> as the highest amorpha-4,11-diene titer. The microbial platform was further enhanced for the production of bisabolene by optimizing the codon usage to 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> for the 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> genes and assembling the eight genes into one single operon under the control of the 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic>UV5 (MevT genes) and 
 <italic class="italic">trc</italic> promoter (MBIS genes) [
 <xref rid="B18-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. As a result, the upgraded platform boosted the FDP supply and achieved titers of 900 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of bisabolene.
