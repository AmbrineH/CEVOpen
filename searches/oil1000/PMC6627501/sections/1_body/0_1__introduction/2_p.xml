<p class="p">Among the distinct essential oils, the vetiver essential oil (VEO) from the 
 <italic class="italic">Ch. zizanioides</italic> grass has drawn growing attention, because it is used in nearly 20% of men’s luxury perfumes [
 <xref rid="B3-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Characterized by its dark woody smell, VEO holds a world production of 300–350 tons per year [
 <xref rid="B4-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] with prices ranging from $380–$500 per kg in 2018 [
 <xref rid="B5-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and expected growth in the market of $169.5 million for 2022 [
 <xref rid="B6-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Industrial production of VEO is performed traditionally by steam distillation from vetiver roots, harvested after 12–18 months of growth and at 1–2 m length; usually, this process attains an extraction yield of 0.2–3% and can be improved to 4% through supercritical fluid extraction [

 <xref rid="B7-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The recurrent shortages in the supply of VEO from the main producer, Haiti due to rainfalls and earthquakes [

 <xref rid="B5-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and the increasing market demand has raised the interest towards a reliable biotechnological production of the main constituent of VEO, the sesquiterpene khusimol, which grants the distinctive woody smell.
