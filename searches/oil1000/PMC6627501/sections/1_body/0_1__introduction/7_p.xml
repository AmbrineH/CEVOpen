<p class="p">In this study, we report the metabolic engineering of (+)-zizaene biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains. The engineering of the biosynthetic pathway involved the overexpression of the MEV pathway to enhance the FDP supply, the evaluation of promoters to efficiently express the ZS, and the engineering of multi-plasmid strains with multiple copies of ZS to boost the ZS supply. Moreover, optimization of the fermentation conditions and evaluation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains were analyzed to improve the production of (+)-zizaene.
