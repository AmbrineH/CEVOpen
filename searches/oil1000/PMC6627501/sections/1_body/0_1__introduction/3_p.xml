<p class="p">Similar to most plant sesquiterpenes, the biosynthesis of khusimol initiates from the glycolysis cycle, which generates the precursorsâ€™ glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate for the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, and acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA) for the cytoplasmic mevalonate (MEV) pathway [
 <xref rid="B8-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Both pathways converge and catalyze the formation of the terpene precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are further assembled by the farnesyl diphosphate synthase (
