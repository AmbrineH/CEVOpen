<p class="p">To raise the ZS supply, the monocistronic vectors pJbeiZS and pETZS were designed by cloning the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene directly after the promoter and further co-transformed into the strain with the pMev vector. The use of the BZS+Mev strain was initially promising because it is capable of tuning the metabolic flux, using unique inducers for FDP (IPTG) and ZS (Arabinose). However, results with the P
 <sub class="sub">BAD</sub> promoter were similar to those obtained by the MevZS strain, possibly due to the similarity in the strength of the P
 <sub class="sub">BAD</sub> promoter versus the 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic>UV5 promoter [
 <xref rid="B37-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Similar outcomes were demonstrated by others, where the 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic>UV5 and P
 <sub class="sub">BAD</sub> promoters produced low or even undetectable levels of sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B11-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Additionally, accumulation of toxic intermediates due to a higher metabolic burden could occur because the BZS+Mev strain harbors the high-copy pJbeiZS plasmid with the pBBR1 origin of replication [
 <xref rid="B43-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. On the other hand, overexpression of soluble ZS protein with the T7-promoter (TZS+Mev strain) was drastically higher than with the P
 <sub class="sub">BAD</sub> promoter (BZS+Mev strain) and subsequently, the production of (+)-zizaene increased considerably.
