<p class="p">The production of (+)-zizaene was metabolically engineered in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> by a recombinant codon-optimized SUMO-fused ZS that enhanced the amounts of soluble ZS protein [
 <xref rid="B10-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Moreover, the optimization of the metabolic flux to (+)-zizaene was the greatest challenge, where the FDP and ZS supply were identified as the limiting factors. Consequently, a strategy was applied to gradually increase the supply of both and augment the metabolic rate driving force towards (+)-zizaene.
