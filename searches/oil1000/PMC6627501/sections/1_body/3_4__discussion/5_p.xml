Regarding the media evaluation, the ADM medium achieved the highest production of (+)-zizaene when compared to the other defined media tests. The main difference in media formulation between tests was the higher amount of nitrogen from the ADM medium, suggesting that nitrogen concentration was the most relevant factor; particularly, because nitrogen is required for the biosynthesis of amino acids that regulates the production of cellular and recombinant proteins [
 <xref rid="B47-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. This could explain the higher cell growth and soluble ZS protein levels from the ADM medium tests when compared to the other tests, which in turn improved the (+)-zizaene levels.
