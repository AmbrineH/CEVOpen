<p class="p">The evaluation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> B strains revealed considerable differences in terpene production due to the particular feature of each strain. The terpene performance increased with the strains that expressed the lower number of recombinant proteins such as the BL21(DE3)-based strains. These results suggest that the expression of the ZS protein is not affected by basal expression (
 <italic class="italic">lysY</italic> gene), neither the β-galactoside permease is required (
 <italic class="italic">lacY</italic> gene), nor the chaperon DsbC enhanced the protein folding and disulfide bond formation, although the ZS protein contains cysteines. On the contrary, overexpression of DsbC drastically dropped the amounts of soluble ZS protein and the (+)-zizaene titers. Consequently, the Tuner(DE3) strain achieved the best performance for terpene production by overexpressing the minimum number of recombinant proteins, thus avoiding the production of unnecessary proteins (β-galactoside permease, DsbC, and lysozyme). This strategy diminished the metabolic burden, defined as the resources consumed for cell maintenance and recombinant protein synthesis that is inversely proportional to cell growth [

As a result, the lower metabolic burden from the Tuner(DE3) strain improved the efficiency of the carbon flux towards (+)-zizaene.
