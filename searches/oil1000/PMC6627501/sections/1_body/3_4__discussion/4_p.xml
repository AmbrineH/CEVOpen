<p class="p">We ventured to raise further the ZS supply by adding a second copy of the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene through the TZS+MevZS strain. As a result, the production of (+)-zizaene was the greatest of all the engineered strains and suggests that the limiting factor was still the ZS supply. The improvement in (+)-zizaene levels could be due to the effect of overexpressing the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> genes by two different promoters on two different vectors (T7 in pETZS and 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic>UV5 in pMevZS). Such strategy could have been a contributive factor, possibly by overexpressing the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene by different promoters, by RBS strength differences from the used vectors, and by the vector copy numbers, which are unequal on multi-plasmid strains due to differences between replication origins, antibiotic markers, and plasmid sizes [

 <xref rid="B42-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. However, more tests are required to draw such conclusions. Additionally, it seems that the in vivo production of (+)-zizaene requires higher amounts of the TPS when compared to other sesquiterpenes such as vetispiradiene (K

 <xref rid="B44-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], due to the low enzyme activity of ZS (K
 <sub class="sub">M</sub> = 0.88 µM) [
 <xref rid="B20-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Therefore, increasing the copy number of the TPS gene in a multi-vector strain was a plausible strategy to improve the flux to (+)-zizaene.
