<p class="p">Initially, production of (+)-zizaene was possible by using the endogenous MEP pathway from 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (TZS strain) but at a lower extent. The high amounts of soluble ZS protein and low titers of (+)-zizaene suggest a limitation on the FDP supply. For that reason, the exogenous MEV pathway was applied, which is the ubiquitous pathway in plants for the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene substrate FDP [
 <xref rid="B34-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Hence, the pMevZS vector was constructed as a polycistronic vector, including all the required genes for terpene production into one vector. Such a strategy has been used for the engineering of many terpenes [
 <xref rid="B23-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] because the maintenance of a single vector by the host cells is more efficient than for multi-vectors [
 <xref rid="B36-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. As a result, the overexpression of the MevZS strain did not increase the levels of (+)-zizaene as expected; possibly due to the lower amounts of soluble ZS protein than the TZS strain. This could be explained by the moderate strength of the 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic>UV5 promoter [
 <xref rid="B37-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], theimproved variant of the 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic> promoter from 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Additionally, the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene was placed eight genes downstream from the promoter in the polycistronic pMevZS vector and eventually, this gene order could affect the overexpression of ZS, as demonstrated by other studies [
 <xref rid="B39-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Moreover, the overexpression of the nine genes produced a large mRNA transcript, which is usually more unstable as short transcripts [
 <xref rid="B42-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Thus, the increase in the FDP supply and the decline in the soluble ZS protein amounts suggest that the limiting factor shifted to the ZS supply. This scenario was deleterious for an optimal metabolic rate, because ZS suffers substrate inhibition from FDP at higher levels of 5 ÂµM, as shown in our previous report [
