<p class="p">Quantification of (+)-zizaene was performed by GC-FID with a GC-2010 plus GC system coupled to a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a 30 m Zebron ZB-Wax Plus column (0.25 mm I.D. × 0.25 μm, Phenomenex, USA). Samples of 1 µL were injected under a splitless mode with an injector temperature of 240 °C. The initial oven temperature was set to 40 °C for 20 s, ramped at 10 °C min

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 230 °C, and held finally for 2 min. Because the (+)-zizaene standard is not commercially available, an α-cedrene standard was used as an equivalent standard due to the relative abundance of the main peaks from the mass spectra as described in our previous report [
