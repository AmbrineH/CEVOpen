<p class="p">Samples of 150 µL from the iso-octane overlay from production cultures were transferred to GC-vials for gas chromatography analysis and product identification was carried out through GC-MS using an Agilent 7890B system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with the following settings: sample injections of 0.5 µL on-column mode through a 30 m VF-WAXms capillary column (0.25 mm internal diameter I.D. × 0.25 μm, Agilent, USA); oven program of 40 °C for 3 min, increasing to 230 °C (10 °C min
