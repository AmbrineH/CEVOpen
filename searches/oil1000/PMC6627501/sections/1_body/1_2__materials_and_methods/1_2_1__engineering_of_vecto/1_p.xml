<p class="p">The description of vectors and strains is summarized in 
 <xref rid="genes-10-00478-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The pETSUMO::ZIZ(co) vector was obtained from our previous study [
 <xref rid="B10-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and the sequence of the codon-optimized SUMO-fused 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene was described in GenBank accession KP231534. The vector pBbA5c-MevT(CO)-MBIS (CO, ispA), encoding the MEV pathway, was a gift from Jay Keasling &amp; Taek Soon Lee (Addgene plasmid #35151). The pJbei-6411 vector for the expression with the arabinose operon was a gift from Taek Soon Lee (Addgene plasmid #47050).
