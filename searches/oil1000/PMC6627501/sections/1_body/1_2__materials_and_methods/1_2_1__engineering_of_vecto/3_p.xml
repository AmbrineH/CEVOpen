<p class="p">For the production of (+)-zizaene by a single polycistronic vector, the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene was cloned into the pMev vector, directly after the 
 <italic class="italic">IspA</italic> gene to yield the pMevZS vector. In brief, the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene was amplified from the pETZS vector by respective primers with complementary overhangs to the BamHI site of the pMev vector. Additionally, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (GATCTAGGAGGTA) from the MEV operon was cloned upstream from the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene. Thereafter, the pMev vector was digested with BamHI, assembled with the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> NEB 10-beta competent cloning strain (New England BioLabs), which is specific for large vectors, was transformed with the pMev vector. For the testing of the P
 <sub class="sub">BAD</sub> promoter through the pJbeiZS plasmid, the cytochrome P450 operon from pJbei-6411 vector was removed, and the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene from the pETZS vector was inserted instead. For that, both the insert and backbone were amplified with complementary overhangs by PCR methods, seamlessly assembled, and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> TOP10 competent cloning strains (IBA, Germany) were transformed for respective screening.
