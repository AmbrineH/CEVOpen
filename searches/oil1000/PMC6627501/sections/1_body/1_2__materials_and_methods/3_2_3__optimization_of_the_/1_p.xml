<p class="p">Cultivation and analytical procedures for media evaluation, optimization of growth temperature and media pH, and testing of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains were carried out as described before with the best performing strain. The evaluation of media comprised the defined media: defined non-inducing broth (DNB), M9 minimal medium (M9) [
 <xref rid="B25-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], and a modified Aparicio defined medium (ADM) with the following composition (g L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>): (NH

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> 10.0, NaCl 1.2, K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> 1.1, MgSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>·7H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O 0.15, K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>HPO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> 9.3, KH

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O 0.001 [
 <xref rid="B26-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Defined media were set to pH 7.2 and 5 g L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of glucose respectively. Additionally, the complex terrific broth (TB) [
 <xref rid="B21-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] was used as a control. The factorial design for the pH and temperature optimization consisted of two factors with the following levels: pH (6.5, 7, and 7.5) and temperature (16, 20, 24, and 28 °C), for a total of 12 combinations with three replicates. Data were analyzed and plotted using the Minitab 16 software (USA).
