<p class="p">Overexpression of the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene with the T7 promoter seemed to overcome the ZS supply limitations of the MevZS and BZS+Mev strains. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of ZS to catalyze the FDP supply still remains unknown. To increase the ZS supply even further, a multi-vector strain that harbored two copies of the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene was engineered. For that, the TZS+MevZS strain was developed, harboring the pETZS and pMevZS vectors, and controlling the expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> genes by the T7 and 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic>UV5 promoters. As a result, the multi-copy 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene strain achieved the best results of all the constructed strains (titer: 13.7 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and yield 11.6 mg g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> DCW) and raised 1.3-fold the (+)-zizaene titers and 1.6-fold the yields in comparison to the TZS+Mev strain (one 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene copy) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a,b). Moreover, it augmented the (+)-zizaene production and titer by 9.7 and 18.4-fold correspondingly when compared to the single-vector MevZS strain. These results suggest that the bottleneck of the metabolic flux was still the ZS supply, which could be improved by the combination of the T7 promoter with multiple copies of the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene, harbored on a multi-vector strain.
