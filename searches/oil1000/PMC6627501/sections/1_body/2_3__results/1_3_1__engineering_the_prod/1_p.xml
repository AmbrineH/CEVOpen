 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> for the production of (+)-zizaene, using glucose as the sole carbon source (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The key enzyme of the biosynthesis of (+)-zizaene is the ZS, which catalyzes the cyclization of the substrate FDP to (+)-zizaene. Due to the plant origin of TPS, most are expressed poorly in
