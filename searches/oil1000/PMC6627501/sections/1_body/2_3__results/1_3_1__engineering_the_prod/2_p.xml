<p class="p">For the overexpression of (+)-zizaene, the production cultures were performed by the two-phase partitioning method [
 <xref rid="B31-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] with a DNB medium and an overlay of iso-octane, which reduces the loss of (+)-zizaene due to its volatility. After 24 h of culture, organic phases from production cultures were obtained and analyzed through GC-MS for the identification of terpenes. All tested strains produced (+)-zizaene as the main product (90%) and Î²-acoradiene as a side product (10%) (
