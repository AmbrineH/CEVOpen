<p class="p">To raise the supply of the precursor FDP, the polycistronic pMevZS vector was constructed with the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene and the exogenous MEV pathway (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-10-00478" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>), which was obtained from the pMEV vector that harbors the following genes: 
 <italic class="italic">AtoB</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">HMGS</italic>*, t
 <italic class="italic">HMGR*</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">MK</italic>*, 
 <italic class="italic">PMK</italic>*, 
 <italic class="italic">PMD</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">IDI</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">IspA</italic> (*genes from 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> that were codon-optimized to 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B18-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Consequently, a single mRNA transcript was expressed under the control of the 
 <italic class="italic">lac</italic>UV5 promoter. As a result, overexpression of the heterologous MEV pathway with the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene (MevZS strain) induced with 0.1 mM IPTG augmented the (+)-zizaene production and yield by 2.7 and 5-fold respectively when compared to the TZS strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a,b). Thus, a relation was observed in both TZS and MevZS strains, where higher amounts of IPTG increased the overexpression of insoluble ZS protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a,c). Moreover, overexpression of the MEV pathway generated a strong metabolic burden, where cell growth diminished by 1.8-fold biomass and 2.1-fold cell density when compared to that of the strain lacking the MEV pathway (TZS strain) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c,d). Although the overexpression of the MEV pathway raised the FDP supply, the production of soluble ZS protein declined dramatically when compared to the TZS strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>c), suggesting that the ZS supply became the limiting factor.
