<p class="p">To raise further the production of (+)-zizaene, fermentation tests were carried out at shake flask scale, comprising the evaluation of culture media, optimization of growth temperature and media pH, and testing of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains. Accordingly, the mineral-salt defined media DNB, ADM, and M9 were tested due to their previous use in metabolic engineering studies and suitability to control carbon-limited growth required for fed-batch or continuous cultivations to reach high-cell density cultures [
 <xref rid="B33-genes-10-00478" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. To compare the performance of defined media against complex media, the TB broth was used. As a result, substantial differences were observed between the defined media, where the highest (+)-zizaene levels and yields were obtained by ADM media, followed by DNB and M9 media (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a). Consequently, the ADM medium was 1.8-fold higher than the DNB medium for the (+)-zizaene titers and 1.2-fold higher for the (+)-zizaene yields. Both tested media were of similar formulation with the exception of the trace elements and nitrogen composition, whereas the concentration of nitrogen of the ADM medium was 2.5-fold higher than the DNB medium. Likewise, cell growth followed a similar behavior to that of the (+)-zizaene production among the tested media, where the complex TB broth had the highest cell growth when compared to the defined media tests (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b). However, the ADM medium obtained the highest (+)-zizaene yields (16.2 mg g DCW
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup>) when compared to all the tests and was consequently selected for further tests.
