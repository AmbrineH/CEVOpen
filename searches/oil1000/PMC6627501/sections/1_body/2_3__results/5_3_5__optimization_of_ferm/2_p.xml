<p class="p">To further improve the fermentation conditions, factorial designs of two levels were implemented for the optimization of growth temperature and pH of the ADM medium. Accordingly, optimal (+)-zizaene levels were found between 19.5‒21.8 °C and pH 6.8‒7.08 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>c) and for (+)-zizaene yields between 18‒20.8 °C and pH 6.8‒7.1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>d). Temperature affected (+)-zizaene levels differently than yields, whereas moderate (+)-zizaene levels (15‒21 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were shown at a broad range of temperature (17.5‒27.7 °C). On the contrary, pH had nearly the same effect on both variables. Additionally, the highest levels of soluble ZS protein were found at lower pH and temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b). Tests at pH 6.5 also produced the highest amounts of insoluble ZS protein, resulting in the lowest (+)-zizaene levels. Similarly, tests carried out at 16 °C dropped the (+)-zizaene levels despite the high amounts of soluble ZS protein, possibly due to enzymatic mechanisms. As a result, the optimal fermentation conditions were determined as 20 °C and pH 7.0, which improved the (+)-zizaene levels to 21.5 mg L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and yields to 16.2 mg g
