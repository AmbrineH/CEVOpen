<p class="p">Strain tests were carried out under optimal fermentation conditions (ADM medium, 20° C and pH 7) to assess the features of the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> B strains SHuffle T7, SHuffle T7 
 <italic class="italic">lysY</italic>, Tuner(DE3) and BL21(DE3), and measure their impact on the production of (+)-zizaene. The SHuffle-based strains were selected to test if there could be an enhancement in the folding of ZS due to the effect of a disulfide bond chaperone DsbC. Additionally, the SHuffle T7 
 <italic class="italic">lysY</italic> variant reduces the basal expression for toxic genes through the expression of lysozyme, coded by the 
 <italic class="italic">lysY</italic> gene. Similarly, the BL21(DE3) variant, the Tuner(DE3) strain lacks the 
 <italic class="italic">lacY</italic> gene that codes for the β-galactosidase permease, which allows fine-tuning for induction and reduces basal expression. As a control, the BL21(DE3) strain was used. As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>e, the differences between the BL21-based and SHuffle-based strains were remarkable; unexpectedly, the best results were shown by the Tuner(DE3) strain, followed by the BL21(DE3), SHuffle T7, and SHuffle T7 
 <italic class="italic">lysY</italic> strains. These observations demonstrate that the strains expressing the lowest number of recombinant proteins produced the highest cell growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>f), and soluble ZS protein amounts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>c), and consequently, the highest (+)-zizaene titers and yields (shown by increasing number of recombinant proteins: Tuner(DE3): 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic>; BL21(DE3): 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">lacY</italic>; SHuffle T7: 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">lacY</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">DsbC</italic>; SHuffle T7 
 <italic class="italic">lysY</italic>: 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">lacY</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">DsbC</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">lysY</italic>). Overexpression of the chaperones by the SHuffle-based strains did not have the expected results; instead, it showed deleterious effects as observed from the low amounts of ZS protein. As a result, the strain that expressed the minimum number of recombinant proteins, the Tuner(DE3) strain, enhanced 1.2-fold the (+)-zizaene levels and 1.4-fold the yields in comparison with the control BL21(DE3) strain.
