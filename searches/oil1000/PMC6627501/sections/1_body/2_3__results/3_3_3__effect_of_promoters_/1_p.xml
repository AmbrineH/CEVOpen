<p class="p">The low ZS supply demonstrated by the MevZS strain could result from either expression mechanisms of polycistronic vectors and, or by the promoter strength. To prove these hypotheses, multi-vector strains were constructed harboring the following plasmids: polycistronic pMev vector (MEV pathway) and monocistronic ZS vector ((+)-zizaene pathway). Two versions of the ZS vectors were constructed in order to test the effect of promoters on the ZS supply. The designed ZS vectors comprised the pETZS vector with the strong T7 promoter and the pJbeiZS vector harboring the weak P

 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene controlled by the T7 promoter (TZS+Mev strain) raised the amounts of soluble ZS protein when compared to that of the induced with the P
 <sub class="sub">BAD</sub> promoter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>d,e). As a consequence, the (+)-zizaene production and yield augmented 7.2 and 4.4-fold, respectively when compared to the BZS+Mev strain, and 7.2 and 11.3-fold correspondingly when compared to the MevZS strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00478-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a,b). Such strategy improved the ZS supply and consequently restored the flux balance of the (+)-zizaene biosynthesis.
