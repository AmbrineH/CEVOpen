<p class="p">In this work, we demonstrated the metabolic engineering of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains for the in vivo production of (+)-zizaene. Moreover, we optimized the limiting factors of the metabolic flux to (+)-zizaene by the overexpression of the MEV pathway, and by boosting the ZS supply by increasing the number of copies of the 
 <italic class="italic">ZS</italic> gene with T7 promoters on a multi-plasmid strain. Final improvement was achieved by optimizing the fermentation conditions and testing of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> B strains to a final (+)-zizaene production of 25.09 mg L
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup> at the shake flask scale. This work offers new insights into the optimization of the metabolic pathway and fermentation conditions for the in vivo production of sesquiterpenes and the development of a novel microbial platform towards the industrialization of fragrant molecules.
