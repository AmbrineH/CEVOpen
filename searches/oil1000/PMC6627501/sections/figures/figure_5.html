 <p> Optimization of the fermentation conditions and testing of E. coli strains for the improvement of the terpene performance. Evaluation of production media: ( A) (+)-zizaene titers and yields, ( B) biomass and cell density. Optimization of growth temperature and media pH: ( C) (+)-zizaene titers, ( D) (+)-zizaene yields. Evaluation of E. coli strains: ( E) (+)-zizaene titers and yields, ( F) biomass and cell density. Data are the mean of four independent replicates from production cultures after 24 h of induction, and the error bars represent the standard deviation. </p>
