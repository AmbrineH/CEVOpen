 <p> Comparison of the performance of the engineered E. coli BL21(DE3) strains induced at different IPTG levels. ( A) (+)-zizaene titers. ( B) (+)-zizaene yields. ( C) biomass from cell dry weight ( D) cell density. Data are the mean of four independent replicates from production cultures after 24 h of induction with DNB medium, and the error bars represent the standard deviation. * BZS+Mev E. coli Top10 strain induced with 1 mM IPTG and different levels of arabinose (Ara). </p>
