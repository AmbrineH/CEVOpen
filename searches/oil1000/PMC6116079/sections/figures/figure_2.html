 <p> Effects of M. piperita essential oil on Calcium mobilisation in differentiated CAD cells. M. piperita essential oil (0.1 mg/mL) was applied (red arrow) and recorded for 250 cycles. Representative of at least 5 cells from 3 separate experiments. ( A) Positive modulation on calcium intracellular mobilisation. A rapid increase in calcium was observed in the neuronal cell body, which peaked approximated cycle 40 post-application (approx. 30 s) and then dropped steadily to a level below the original starting concentration at cycle 250. ( B) Extension of depolarizationâ€”induced calcium mobilisation. In the presence of M. piperita essential oil (0.1 mg/mL) for approx. 180 s, a depolarisation pulse for 250 cycles elicited a rapid calcium increase followed by a delayed decrease compared to a depolarising pulse alone, which desensitised significantly quicker. ( C) Representative images. Representative images of individual cell body calcium changes in the presence of M. piperita essential oil (0.1 mg/mL), pre-application, peak of calcium increase and post peak reduction in calcium levels. </p>
