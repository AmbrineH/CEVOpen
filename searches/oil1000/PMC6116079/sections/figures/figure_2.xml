  <p class="p">Effects of 
   <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> essential oil on Calcium mobilisation in differentiated CAD cells. 
   <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> essential oil (0.1 mg/mL) was applied (red arrow) and recorded for 250 cycles. Representative of at least 5 cells from 3 separate experiments. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Positive modulation on calcium intracellular mobilisation. A rapid increase in calcium was observed in the neuronal cell body, which peaked approximated cycle 40 post-application (approx. 30 s) and then dropped steadily to a level below the original starting concentration at cycle 250. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Extension of depolarizationâ€”induced calcium mobilisation. In the presence of 
   <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> essential oil (0.1 mg/mL) for approx. 180 s, a depolarisation pulse for 250 cycles elicited a rapid calcium increase followed by a delayed decrease compared to a depolarising pulse alone, which desensitised significantly quicker. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Representative images. Representative images of individual cell body calcium changes in the presence of 
   <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> essential oil (0.1 mg/mL), pre-application, peak of calcium increase and post peak reduction in calcium levels.
