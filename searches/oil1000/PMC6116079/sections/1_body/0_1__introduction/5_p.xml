<p class="p">In terms of the effects of these CNS interactions, investigations utilizing animal models have observed increased ambulatory behaviour [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], improved memory [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and anxiolytic effects which are potentially driven by modulation of serotonergic or dopaminergic function [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Currently, only one controlled trial has investigated the brain function effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> species in humans. Here promising effects were observed on quality of working memory and spatial working memory as well as improved sleep onset and vigour, alertness and overall mood in a group of 50â€“70 years olds following 90 days supplementation with 600 mg and 900 mg of an aqueous extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> (spearmint) that contained the phenolic constituents but not the terpene constituents of the plant material [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The current study extends this research by investigating the cognitive and mood effects of oral administration of mint essential oil comprised of the volatile terpene phytochemical constituents of a 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> plant, in healthy, young humans. A preliminary in vitro analysis assessing the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory properties and GABA
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>, glutamate 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-Methyl-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-aspartic acid (NMDA) and nicotinic receptor binding properties of a range of organic 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> essential oils was conducted in order to select a treatment liable to exert CNS effects relevant to cognitive function and mood.
