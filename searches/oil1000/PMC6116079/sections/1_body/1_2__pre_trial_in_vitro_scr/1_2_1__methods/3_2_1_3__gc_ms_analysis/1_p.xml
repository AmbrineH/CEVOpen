<p class="p">The GC-MS analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC coupled to an Agilent 5975C MS. The oils were analysed using the GC-MS method described previously [
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In summary, chromatography was performed using a 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm DB-5 MS column (J &amp; W Scientific Inc., Rancho Cordova, CA, USA) using a temperature programme of 40–300 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and the injection volume was 1 μL (split 1:10) at 220 °C, via an autosampler. Detection was by MS, fitted with electrospray ionisation source operated at 70 eV, with a source temperature of 180 °C; mass spectra were recorded in the range
