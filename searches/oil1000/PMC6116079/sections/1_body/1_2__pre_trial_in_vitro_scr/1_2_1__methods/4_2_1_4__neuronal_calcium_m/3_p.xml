<p class="p">The incubation period for each treatment was for periods of 250 cycles (0.63 s each) before the appliance of the depolarising buffer (50 mM KCl) and then imaged for a further period of 250 cycles. All the solutions were kept at 37 °C to avoid any stress on the cells during the sample preparation and the imaging experiment. For the imaging, the Zeiss LSM 850 with an Airyscan microscope was used. The laser used for imaging was set at 514 nm: 1.1% (Ch2GaAsp: 524–620). The spectrum window was set between 24,620 and a pin hole of 49 µm was used. A size 63 oil lens with an LA of 1.4 was used to capture each image and the time between each frame (time series) was set at zero. The duration for one frame was 633.02 ms. To extract the figures and fluorescence intensities, the Zeiss software was used.</p>
