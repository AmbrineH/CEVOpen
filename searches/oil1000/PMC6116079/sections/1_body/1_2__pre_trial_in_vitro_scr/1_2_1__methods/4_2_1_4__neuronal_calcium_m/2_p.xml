<p class="p">A 2 mM stock of the Calcium Green™-1AM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cramlington, UK) probe was prepared in DMSO (Sigma, Poole, UK); this was stored at −20 °C for up to 2 months. On the day of the imaging experiments the probe stock was brought to room temperature and then diluted in HEPES physiological buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, 5 mM KCl) to a 1 μM solution. The cells were plated in flat bottom µ-dishes (60 µ-Dish, 35 mm, high glass flat bottom, Ibidi GmbH). The cells were washed with 1 mL of physiological buffer and incubated for 40 min in 1 mL of the Calcium-Green solution (1 μM). After the incubation period, the cells were washed again with the HEPES physiological buffer and maintained in HEPES physiological buffer prior to the imaging experiments. All reagents applied to the clonal cells during the experiments were dissolved in the HEPES physiological buffer.
