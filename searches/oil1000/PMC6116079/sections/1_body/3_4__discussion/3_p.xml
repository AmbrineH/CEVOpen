<p class="p">In terms of in vitro properties, all of the spearmint/peppermint oils were confirmed to have the expected terpene constituents (as defined in the British Pharmacopoeia (
 <uri xlink:href="www.pharmacopoeia.co.uk" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.pharmacopoeia.co.uk</uri>), with the spearmints typified by high levels of limonene and carvone, while the peppermints contained high levels of menthol and menthone (see 
 <xref rid="nutrients-10-01029-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The essential oil chosen for the behavioural study had the highest level of menthol (36.7%) and it exhibited both concentration dependent GABA
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and nicotinic receptor binding properties, alongside significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (thereby potentially increasing the synaptic availability of acetylcholine). The GABAergic and cholinesterase inhibitory effects are broadly in line with previous investigations of

 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] and other members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="B53-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. With regards the nicotinic receptor binding, whilst there is a dearth of research assessing the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> extracts per se, menthol has been shown to modulate nicotinic receptor populations and sensitivity and inhibit nicotinic receptor mediated activity [
 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Similar observations have been noted with the essential oil from another member of the Lamiaceae, 
 <italic class="italic">Melissa officinalis</italic> (Chazot, unpublished). In the current study, the post-hoc investigation of calcium mobilisation in a CAD cell neuronal model showed an increase in activity following application of the essential oil. It seems likely that the effects here were predicated on cholinergic upregulation, rather than any aspect of GABAergic modulation. Indeed, the behavioural consequences of increased GABAergic activity (which is inhibitory) would be expected to include modulation of mood and anxiolytic properties and potential selective impairments to cognitive function. Here, the improved performance on the Cognitive Demand Battery; which requires considerable attentional resources, would fit well with the theory of upregulated cholinergic activity. The disjunction between observations of in vitro downregulation of nicotinic receptor mediated activity by menthol [
 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and potential cholinergic improvements in cognitive function and mental fatigue following the essential oil could be explained by several factors. First, the effects here could have been predicated on synergistic effects between component terpenes; with menthol contributing to, rather than driving the effects of the essential oil. Such synergistic effects have been seen previously with regards, for instance, AChE inhibition [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Second and similarly, the effects may have represented the balance between menthol’s receptor mediated downregulation of nicotinic activity and the essential oil’s AChE inhibition related upregulation of acetylcholine levels. Third, in vitro effects are typically measured within a short period of application and the behavioural effects here may be predicated on later effects that are different in nature, including a potential physiological “rebound” triggered by the immediate effects on cellular function. Fourth, the cholinergic effects of menthol may differ depending on the nature of the neural tissue (e.g., downregulation has typically been shown in sensory neurons). Peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic>) essential oil also elicited an increase in [Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>] and an extension of the depolarisation response as previously reported for menthol; a major constituent of the oil [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The neuroprotective properties in the face of oxidative stress displayed by 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> in CAD cells (online 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-10-01029" class="xref">Supplementary Appecndix I</xref>) is consistent with a previous study with a related cell line [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. These pharmacological functional effects may also contribute, in part, to the positive cognitive effects of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>. Of course, the net effects of the essential oil may be a result of a combination of these factors or, indeed, a host of other mechanisms of action that were not addressed in this study.
