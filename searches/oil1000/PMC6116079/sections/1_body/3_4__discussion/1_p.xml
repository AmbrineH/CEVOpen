<p class="p">In this study, the peppermint (
 <italic class="italic">Mentha</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">piperita</italic>) essential oil selected for the human behavioural study exhibited in vitro concentration-dependent GABA
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> and nicotinic receptor binding properties and inhibited acetylcholinesterase. When administered to human adults the higher dose of essential oil (100 μL) resulted in improvements in performance across two of the three Cognitive Demand Battery (CDB) tasks, with a trend towards improved performance on the third task. In terms of individual tasks, the accuracy of performing the RVIP task was significantly improved during the 1 h and 3 h post-dose assessments, whilst the number of correct Serial 3s subtractions was significantly increased at 3 h post-dose. This latter finding also coincided with a trend towards improved accuracy on the Serial 7s task and a significant attenuation of the subjective mental fatigue experienced by the placebo group at the same time point. Performance on the individual cognitive tasks (i.e., those only repeated once per assessment) and measurements of anxiety (STAI-state) and psychological state (Bond-Lader) were not modulated by the treatment.
