<p class="p">Naturally, this pattern of effects raises the question as to why performance of the CDB was preferentially affected. The underlying rationale for this approach to testing, whereby participants engage in an extended period of demanding task performance, is that the increase in neuronal or psychological demands provides a more sensitive background against which to measure treatment related effects. This may be due either to the rate-limiting depletion of physiological brain resources during extended task performance, or alternatively, the increased level of engagement required by the participants. Certainly, this approach has proved sensitive to the cognitive/mental fatigue effects of a wide range of nutritional interventions [
