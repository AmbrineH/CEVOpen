<p class="p">Interestingly, a previous study that assessed the cognitive effects of 50 μL of essential oil from sage (
 <italic class="italic">Salvia lavandulaefolia</italic> Vahl.; synonym for 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">lavandulifolia</italic> (Vahl) Gams), which is in the same sub-family as 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> and synthesises many similar monoterpenes, demonstrated decreased mental fatigue and improved Serial 3 s subtractions using the same Cognitive Demand Battery [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-01029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. As here, the effects were greater at a later time point (4 h post-dose) than at 1 h post-dose. In the previous sage study the cognitive effects also extended to the other individual cognitive tasks and included improved alertness and memory. The lower dose for the current study was selected on the basis of this previous study and given that the lower dose (50 μL) administered here was less effective, it seems likely that 100 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> essential oil may represent the lower reaches of this oil’s dose-response profile. If this is the case, higher doses of this oil may well result in a more comprehensive pattern of cognitive/mood effects. This possibility, alongside research disentangling the behavioural effects of the major components of these essential oils, deserves further research attention.
