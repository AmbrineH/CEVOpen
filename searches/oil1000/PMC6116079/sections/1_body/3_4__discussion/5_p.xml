 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic>) essential oil with high levels of menthol and menthone and characteristic in vitro AChE inhibitory, calcium regulatory, GABA
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> receptor and nicotinic receptor binding properties, beneficially modulated performance of demanding cognitive tasks and attenuated the increase in mental fatigue associated with extended cognitive testing. These effects were only evident for the higher (100 μL) of the two doses investigated; raising the possibility that doses of this essential oil in excess of 100 μL would exert greater effects in terms of cognitive/mood enhancement.
