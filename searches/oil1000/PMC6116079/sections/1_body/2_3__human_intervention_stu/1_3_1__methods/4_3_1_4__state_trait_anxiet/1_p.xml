<p class="p">During the training/screening session, participants completed the entire pen and paper STAI to indicate general levels of state and trait anxiety. During the testing session participants completed the state subscale only. The STAI state subscale is a widely used instrument for measuring fluctuating levels of anxiety. The subscale contains 20 statements (e.g., “I am calm”) each with a 4-point Likert scale. Participants rate how much they feel like each statement at the time of making the response. Scores on the STAI range from 20 to 80, with higher scores representing higher levels of anxiety.</p>
