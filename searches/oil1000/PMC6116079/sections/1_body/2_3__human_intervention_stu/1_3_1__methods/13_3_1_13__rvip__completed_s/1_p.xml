<p class="p">The RVIP task requires the participant to monitor a continuous series of single digits for targets of three consecutive odd or even numbers. The white digits are presented on the black computer screen at the rate of 100 per minute; with eight correct target strings in each minute presented in pseudo-random order. The participant responds to the detection of a target string by pressing the appropriate response button as quickly as possible. In terms of task outcomes, RVIP is scored for number of target strings correctly detected and the average reaction time (ms) for correct detections. </p>
