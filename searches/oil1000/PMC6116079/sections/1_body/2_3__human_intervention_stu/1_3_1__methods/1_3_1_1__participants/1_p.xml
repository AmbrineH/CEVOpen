<p class="p">24 participants (9 Male/15 Female, Mean age 25.2 years, Range 21â€“35 years) reported themselves to be in good health and free from illicit drugs, alcohol, prescription medication (apart from contraception in the case of women) and herbal extracts/food supplements at each assessment. Participants confirmed that they would also comply with these exclusion criteria for the duration of the study and that any changes in medication or health status would be reported to the researcher when they occurred. Participants who had suffered a head injury, neurological disorder or neuro-developmental disorder were excluded from participation, as were those who did not have English as their 1st language (or were not equivalent to a native English speaker; due to the cognitive tasks utilized here not being validated on non-native English speakers) had any relevant food allergies or intolerances, digestive problems, smoked tobacco, drank excessive amounts of caffeine (more than 600 mg day as assessed by a caffeine consumption questionnaire), were pregnant, seeking to become so, or were breast feeding.</p>
