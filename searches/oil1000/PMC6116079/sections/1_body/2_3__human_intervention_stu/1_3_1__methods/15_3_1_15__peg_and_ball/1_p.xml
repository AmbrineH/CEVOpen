<p class="p">Two configurations of wooden peg (×3) and ball (×3; blue, green and red) diagrams are displayed, on screen, with the top diagram denoting the “goal” configuration of balls on pegs. Participants must rearrange the balls on the “starting” configuration below this to match the “goal.” They must do this in the least number of moves possible. The task is scored for average thinking time (ms), average completion time (ms) and errors (total number of moves in excess of minimum required to complete all trials).</p>
