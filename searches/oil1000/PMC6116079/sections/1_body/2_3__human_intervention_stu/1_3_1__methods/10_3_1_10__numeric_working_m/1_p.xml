<p class="p">Five random digits from 1â€“9 were presented sequentially for the participant to hold in memory. This was followed by a series of 30 probe digits (15 targets and 15 distractors). For each, the participant indicated whether or not it had been in the original series by a simple key press. The task consisted of 3 separate trials. Accuracy (% correct) and mean reaction time (ms) were recorded.</p>
