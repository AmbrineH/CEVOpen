<p class="p">Serial 3 and 7 subtractions: At the start of the 2 min task a standard instruction screen informs the participant to count backwards in 3 s or 7 s as quickly and accurately as possible, using the keyboards linear number keys to enter each response. Participants are instructed verbally at the outset that if they make a mistake they should carry on subtracting from the new incorrect number with subsequent responses scored as correct in relation to the new number. To begin, a random starting number between 800 and 999 is presented on the computer screen, which is cleared by the entry of the first response. Each three-digit response was represented on screen by three asterisks which disappeared after enter was pressed to signal completion of the response. Outcomes are the total number of correct subtractions and the number of incorrect responses.</p>
