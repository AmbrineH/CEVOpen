<p class="p">Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS statistics 22. Prior to analysis, task/mood data from the three post-dose assessments (1 h, 3 h, 6 h) was converted to “% change from pre-dose baseline” (Serial 3 s/7 s errors and Word Recall scores were analysed as simple numeric “change from baseline” due to the potential to score zero at baseline). In order to examine the time course of any effects of the essential oils across the testing day, the primary analysis of all task/mood data was undertaken with a priori planned comparisons, comparing data (averaged across 4 repetitions for CDB tasks) from the placebo condition to that from each of the two active treatments at each post-dose time point using

To reduce the possibility of Type II errors, planned comparisons are only reported for those measures that evinced a significant treatment related effect on the initial ANOVA or related multivariate test.
