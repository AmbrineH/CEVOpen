 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203653.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> shows the boxplots of the optimal treatments to reduce the cover percentage over six and 18 months. It can be seen that the application of Glyphosate is effective at six months and the addition of seeding produces more consistent results. Glyphosate alone does no better than the other treatments at 18 months, but the addition of seeding reduces the cover percentage and again produces more consistent results.
