<p class="p">The main treatments of pine oil (p = 0.000), glyphosate (p = 0.000) and seeding (p = 0.003) resulted in significant reductions in the measured cover. However, these need to be interpreted in context of the above time interactions and the pine oil*glyphosate interaction (p = 0.001). This interaction indicates that one or other treatment needs to be applied, but there was no improvement when applying both. Consideration of these results suggests that either pine oil or glyphosate should be used with seeding, and it is clear that the addition of seeding was more effective for both pine oil and glyphosate after 18 months. The mean percentage covers of these treatments are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> below and indicate that the most effective of these treatments was glyphosate with seeding across both time periods.
