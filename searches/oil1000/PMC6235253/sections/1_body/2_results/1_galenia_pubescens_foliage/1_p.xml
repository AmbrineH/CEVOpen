<p class="p">The assumption checking indicated that the repeated measures analysis of cover percent was appropriate. The initial cover percent was used as a covariate and was not significant (p = 0.200). There was a significant time effect (p = 0.000) with an increase in the cover percentage after 18 months (36%) compared to six months (23%) across all treatments. Coverage at both of these time periods was still less than the original measure (66%). However, this time effect was modified by several treatments as indicated by the following significant interactions with time: time*pine oil (p = 0.000); time*glyphosate (p&lt;0.001); and time*seeding (p = 0.002). The analysis of the interactions indicated that pine oil and glyphosate were very effective after six months but not so effective after 18 months. However, whilst seeding is not as effective at six months, the effect lasts longer and is effective at 18 months.</p>
