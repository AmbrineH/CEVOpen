<p class="p">The previous sections identified the optimal treatments for both cover percentage (glyphosate and seeding) and seedbank abundance (pine oil and mulch). Ideally, a common treatment strategy should be applied to reduce both seedbank abundance and cover percentage. This section identifies a common treatment strategy for both cover percentage and seedbank abundance that produces results similar to the optimum treatments.</p>
