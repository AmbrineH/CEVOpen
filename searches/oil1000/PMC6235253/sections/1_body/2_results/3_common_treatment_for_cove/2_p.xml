<p class="p">The statistical analyses indicate that pine oil and seeding are the only main effects that are significant in both cover percentage and seedbank abundance. Glyphosate and seeding was shown to be the optimal treatments for cover percentage. Pine oil can replace glyphosate as a treatment because pine oil also has a significant main effect (p&lt;0.001) and the glyphosate*pine oil interaction (p = 0.001) shows that one or other should be used but not both together. Hence, pine oil can replace glyphosate, and together with seeding can have a minimal increase in the cover percentage compared to the optimal treatment. This is supported by the percentage covers shown in
