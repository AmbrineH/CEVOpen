<p class="p">In terms of seedbank abundance, pine oil and mulch together produced the best results. Seeding can replace mulch as a treatment because seeding also has a significant main effect (p = 0.023) and the seed*mulch interaction (p&lt;0.001) shows that one or other should be used, but not both together. This all indicates that pine oil and seeding is just as effective as pine oil and mulch in terms of reducing seedbank abundance. Figs

The similarity of the results when applying pine oil and seeding compared to the optimal treatments are supported when comparing Figs
