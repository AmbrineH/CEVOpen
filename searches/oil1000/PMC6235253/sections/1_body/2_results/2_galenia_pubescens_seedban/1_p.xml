<p class="p">The assumption checking indicated that the repeated measures analysis of seedbank abundance required a square-root transformation. This transformation did not quite meet the multivariate normality assumption, but was a marked improvement compared to the analysis of the original data. Further analysis of the problem associated with the multivariate normality assumption revealed that it appeared due to nonzero kurtosis rather than nonzero skew, and therefore is more robust to the departure of normality for the analysis conducted. The initial seedbank abundance was the covariate measure and was not significant (p = 0.342).</p>
