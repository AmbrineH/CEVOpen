<p class="p">The main treatments of pine oil (p&lt;0.001), mulch (p&lt;0.00), and seeding (p = 0.023) were all significant. However, these need to be interpreted with the following interactions: pine oil*mulch (p&lt;0.001); glyphosate*mulch (p = 0.019); and seed*mulch (p = 0.003). The seed*mulch interaction showed that one or the other treatment should be used but there was no benefit in using both. The glyphosate*mulch interaction indicated that it is better to use mulch alone, with no benefit being observed on addition of glyphosate. The pine oil*mulch interaction showed that while it was beneficial to use both materials, it was particularly useful to add mulch when not using pine oil.</p>
