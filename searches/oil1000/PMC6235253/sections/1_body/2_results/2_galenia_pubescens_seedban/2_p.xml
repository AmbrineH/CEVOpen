<p class="p">For seedbank abundance, the time effect was not significant (p = 0.165); however there were a couple of interactions with time: time*glyphosate (p = 0.008) and time*seeding (p = 0.016). Both interactions indicated that the application of glyphosate and seeding were more beneficial after 18 months compared to six months. There was also a significant three-way interaction of time*pine oil*mulch (p = 0.031). This interaction showed that when not using pine oil, the benefits of mulching were larger at six months compared to 18 months. There was slight improvement when using both pine and mulching at both time periods.</p>
