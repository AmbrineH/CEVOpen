<p class="p">Of interest to this investigation is that, according to a recent report from the Weed Society of Victoria, there are no biological control options currently available for

 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> in Australia [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Whilst one study to investigate options for chemical control of this species has recently been undertaken [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], at this time there are no known organic control agents available. Therefore, efforts to develop effective alternative means of weed control are required that are not only eco-friendly, but are also cost effective and biologically robust.
