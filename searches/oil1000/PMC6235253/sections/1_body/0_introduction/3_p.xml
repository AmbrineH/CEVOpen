<p class="p">In this latter respect, various factors appear to give non-indigenous species a competitive advantage over indigenous grassland species. These include the disbursement of supplement-rich water from neighboring farming or urban areas, the soil-unsettling practices connected with vehicle and stock access, as well as the infrastructural activities of road and rail management agencies and of utility companies [

Unless different management practices and innovative control mechanisms are instituted, the remaining grasslands will be increasingly threatened by weed invasion and other degradation processes. Indeed, it has been widely noted that many of these highly invasive alien species, particularly
