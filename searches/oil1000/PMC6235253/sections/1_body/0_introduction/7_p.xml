<p class="p">This study aims to provide evidence to inform long-term management solutions intended to swing the competitive advantage towards native grasslands species by: (i) selectively killing mature 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> plants through spot applications of glyphosate; (ii) reducing the 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> seedbank through application of an essential oil (pine oil); (iii) applying mulch (sugar and sawdust) to increase microbial drawdown of soil nitrogen to reduce competitiveness of nitrogen-loving colonising weeds such as 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens;</italic> and (iv) introducing native grassland species to colonise bare ground created by the herbicide, pine oil and mulch treatments to provide adequate vegetation competition as a means for reducing reestablishment of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic>. If these techniques are effective, new eco-friendly rehabilitation and management methodologies may be developed to accelerate restoration efforts in these degraded grasslands, and innovative seedbank control techniques, such as that proposed in this investigation, may become an effective tool for eradication and control of other priority weed species in the future.
