It is listed as a ‘threatened entity’ under Victorian legislation, and has been nominated as a ‘critically endangered community’ under Australian Federal legislation. In western Melbourne, 1670 ha (23%) of the 7230 ha of native grassland present in 1985 has been damaged by development, and a further 1469 ha (21%) was degraded to non-native grassland by 2000. In the remaining areas of native grassland, fewer patches, and greater distances between patches, were recorded in 2000 than in 1985, showing that, in addition to the initial invasion problem, fragmentation of these native areas has intensified [
