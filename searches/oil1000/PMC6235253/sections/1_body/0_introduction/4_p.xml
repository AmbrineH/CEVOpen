 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> infestation in Australia are currently restricted to herbicide treatments and mechanical removal [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], which limits the success of control options in many situations. However, compounding the problem is that studies have shown that increasing use and reliance on a few synthetic herbicides has not only resulted in environmental and human health issues, it is leading to an expanding incidence of herbicidal resistance among many weed species [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Furthermore, options for chemical weed control in non-arable situations are limited to either very expensive spot treatments, or blanket coverage which is non-selective, and such intensive use of synthetic herbicides can result in significant soil and groundwater contamination. In addition, Warnock et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] suggested that in general, herbicide application was only effective in the short-term, since the bare soil areas resulting from the herbicide treatments actually assists in the promotion of new seedlings which arise from pre-existing seedbanks laid down in previous years. Indeed, several authors suggest that this phenomenon is common to many weed species, and that herbicide treatment aimed at achieving short-term goals can result not only in reinvasion, but can also increase weed abundance to a level greater than that existed prior to treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Clearly, this unanticipated outcome moves the composition of the vegetation community further away from the desired outcome [

 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In addition, use of herbicide as a control method may have several possible side-effects, including spray drift from aerial application which can impact surrounding areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. It has also been observed that any areas that are physically missed in a particular herbicide application exercise, may represent a constant source of seed for rapid re-colonisation, and a significant complicating factor is that some herbicides, such as glyphosate, are not species-specific, therefore, non-target species are likely to be inadvertently affected [
