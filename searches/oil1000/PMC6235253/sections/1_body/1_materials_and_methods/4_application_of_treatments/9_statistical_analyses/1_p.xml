<p class="p">Cover percentage and seedbank data were analysed using Repeated Measures ANCOVA to test the four treatments (glyphosate, pine oil, seeding and mulch) and their associated interactions over two time periods (six months and 18 months after treatment). Significant interactions (up to three way interactions) were investigated using interaction plots and investigation of the simple effects. The initial time of treatment cover percent and seed abundance were used as a covariate in their respective analyses. The statistical analyses assumptions were investigated by checking univariate and multivariate normality of the residuals as well as multivariate outliers.</p>
