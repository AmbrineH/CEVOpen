<p class="p">The timing of all combined treatments was chosen to permit each of them to achieve their optimal effect, as follows. In the plots which received glyphosate plus any other treatment, glyphosate was applied first. The pine oil was applied two weeks after glyphosate, then the mulch was added two more weeks after the pine oil treatment (four weeks after glyphosate). Native seeds were scattered onto designated plots one week after the mulch application (five weeks after glyphosate). However, where the seeding treatments were combined with mulch, the addition of mulch occurred after seed addition in order to protect seeds and to provide warmth to the soil.</p>
