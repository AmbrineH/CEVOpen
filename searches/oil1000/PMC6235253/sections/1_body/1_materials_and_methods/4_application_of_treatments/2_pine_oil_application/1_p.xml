<p class="p">Pine oil, which is an essential oil, was selected for this research because it is widely commercially available. Pine oil (BioWeed™ and BioSeed™) is a patented distilled essential oil of radiata pine (Pinus radiata), produced by Certified Organics Pty Ltd, which is a joint Australian/New Zealand company. BioWeed™ and BioSeed™ herbicides are not systemic herbicides. They work by stripping the outer coating of plant and seed material when it comes into contact with the preparation, causing massive cell collapse and desiccation. A solution of 10% pine oil in water was applied, with a watering can, at a rate of 72 L per 36m
