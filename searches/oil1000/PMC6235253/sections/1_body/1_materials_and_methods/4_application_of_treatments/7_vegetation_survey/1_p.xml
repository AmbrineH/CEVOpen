<p class="p">To measure the effectiveness of the treatments, three surveys of the aboveground vegetation cover were carried out. The baseline survey was conducted in October 2013, prior to commencement of the experiment. Following the application of all treatments in autumn 2014, there were two follow-up assessments, the first after six months in the spring of 2014 and the second after 18 months in the spring of 2015. The procedure for measuring the aboveground vegetation is as described in Dix [

 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Within each 6 m x 6 m plot, four 5 m transects were arranged at 1 m intervals across each plot. To avoid possible interference from ‘edge effects’, the first transect line was set out 1 m from the corner posts. Using the point intercept technique, measurements were taken every 20 cm for each transect. This resulted in 25 intercept points per transect and 100 intercept points for each plot. At each intercept point, a record was made of whether the ground at that point was: bare ground or rock, covered with litter, or covered by vegetation. Where covered by vegetation, the plant species were recorded. The point intercept method was also used to characterise percentage cover by species; that is, at each of 100 intercept points within the 64 6 x 6 m plots, a record was made of the species present. This provided a mean percentage score over all found species across all plots.
