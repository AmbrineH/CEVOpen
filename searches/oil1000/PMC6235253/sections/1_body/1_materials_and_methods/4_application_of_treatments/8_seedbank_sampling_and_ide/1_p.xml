<p class="p">To determine the effect of the treatments on seedbank composition, soil samples were collected from all plots prior to treatments being applied, and the constituents of the soil seedbank were recorded. This data was subsequently used as a baseline for a comparison of the effectiveness of single treatments, as well as combinations of treatments. During the remainder of the experiment, four soil samples were taken from all plots at two time intervals, six months (October 2014) and 18 months (October 2015) after treatments were applied. The procedure for measuring the composition percentage of the soil seedbank is described in Bertiller [
