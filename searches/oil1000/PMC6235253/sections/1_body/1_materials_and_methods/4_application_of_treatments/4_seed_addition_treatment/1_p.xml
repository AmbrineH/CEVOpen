<p class="p">A seed mix of four native grass species was spread evenly onto the surface of each of the plots prior to a mulch treatment in order to provide competition to 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic>. Prior to applying the seeds, plots were lightly harrowed using a metal rake to aid seed penetration into the soil, and the seeds were hand-broadcast in an even fashion. The seed mix used in this experiment comprised a mixture of 
 <italic class="italic">Rytidosperma acerosum</italic> (Vickery) seed at a rate of 20–30 kg/ha, 
 <italic class="italic">Bothrichloa macra</italic> (Steud.) (red-leg grass) seed at 30–40 kg/ha, 
 <italic class="italic">Themeda triandra</italic> (Forsk.) (Kangaroo grass) seed at 40–50 kg/ha and 
 <italic class="italic">Austrostipa bigeniculata</italic> (Hughes) (spear grass) seed at 20–30 kg/ha. The seed was sourced from Flora Victoria, a registered producer of native seed.
