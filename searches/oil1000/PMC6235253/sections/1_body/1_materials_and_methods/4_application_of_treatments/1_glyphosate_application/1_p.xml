<p class="p">A new generation of glyphosate herbicide, Raze® (Sipcam Pacific Australia Pty. Ltd.), was used for the glyphosate application treatments. It is a water-soluble liquid, from the glycine group of herbicides. It is a non-selective, broad-spectrum, systemic herbicide that is used for control of a wide range of annual and perennial weeds [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The herbicide is absorbed by plant leaves and green stems, and is then translocated through the plant to the root system. The active ingredient inhibits a plant enzyme (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate [EPSP] synthase), causing a breakdown in the metabolic photosynthesis pathway, which leads to the eventual death of the plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The herbicide was applied following the appropriate herbicide treatment combinations, to all but the control plots, in early March 2014. The rate used was 90 ml of herbicide per 10 L of water. Plots receiving selective glyphosate treatment were sprayed using a backpack sprayer (Solo®, model 425) at 90 psi, with a piston pump and flat spray nozzle). The entire surface area of the plots were sprayed. The ambient temperature during application was 30°C, and there was no wind.
