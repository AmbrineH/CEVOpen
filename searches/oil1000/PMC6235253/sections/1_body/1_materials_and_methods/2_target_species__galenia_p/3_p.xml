<p class="p">At the local level, infestations of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> are becoming an increasing issue within the Western Grassland Reserve where it dominates areas previously occupied by native grassland species. 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> is a drought-tolerant, salt-tolerant herbaceous plant, and, importantly, it has been found to have a higher extractable nitrate reductase activity than for any previously observed higher plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In 1979, Williams [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] showed that consequent high levels of nitrates and soluble oxalates produced by 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> can be toxic to stock. Williams [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] also showed that when 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> grows on infertile soils, these chemicals were not found to be produced in high levels, but when grown in fertile soils these chemicals can accumulate to toxic levels.
