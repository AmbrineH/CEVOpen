 <italic class="italic">Galenia pubescens</italic> was first reported in Victoria in the early 1900s [

 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], with infestations being particularly severe in the upper Hunter region of New South Wales [

 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> forms a roughly circular mat on the ground, growing out from a deep central stem in a similar habit to 
 <italic class="italic">Polygonum aviculare</italic> (wireweed) [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> has been found to smother other plants, and infestations have been linked with statistically-significant lower levels of native species richness and diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Its smothering habit of growing over surrounding vegetation leads to its dominance in many instances.
