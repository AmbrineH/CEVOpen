<p class="p">This study was carried out in four 96 m x 96 m study-blocks. Each block was partitioned into 6 m x 6 m subplots, giving 16 plots with almost uniform infestation levels of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic>. The trial thus consisted of 16 treatments, conducted in a completely randomized block-design (CRBD) which was replicated four times across the study blocks. The five basic treatments were: (i) control (no treatment); (ii) a chemical herbicide (glyphosate); (iii) essential oil (pine oil); (iv) mulch (sawdust + white sugar), and (v) seed addition (a mixture of native grass seeds). Each of these was applied as separate treatments, and as all possible combinations of treatments: (vi) glyphosate + pine oil, (vii) glyphosate + mulch, (viii) glyphosate + seeding, (ix) pine oil + mulch, (x) pine oil + seeding, (xi) mulch + seeding, (xii) glyphosate + pine oil + mulch, (xiii) glyphosate + pine oil + seeding, (xiv) glyphosate + mulch + seeding, (xv) pine oil + mulch + seeding, (xvi) glyphosate + pine oil + mulch + seeding. Each treatment plot was permanently marked with numbered fence droppers, individually labelled.
