<p class="p">The study was conducted in an area proposed for addition to the Western Grassland Reserves, approximately 12 km from Werribee, at 37° 49' 5.63" S and 144° 34' 58.77" E and an altitude of 66 m. The site is representative of the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> southeast of the Werribee River, Victoria. Prior to this experiment in 2013, soil data was collected under high density 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens’</italic> infestations, and at this time it was noted that soils with high cover generally had higher potassium and sulphur levels, as well as a low pH. For use in the treatments, pine oil, white sugar and sawdust were obtained from commercial trade shops. We obtained permission from Parks Victoria, Australia to carry out this project in the Western Grassland Reserves.
