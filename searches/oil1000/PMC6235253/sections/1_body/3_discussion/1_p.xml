<p class="p">It is not unusual for plant populations to fluctuate with time and environmental change, and on occasions, elevated populations that have become a problem may require appropriate control management strategies. Often, allowing sufficient time for natural succession to be asserted can overcome this problem, but it has been suggested that this ‘do nothing’ approach may not be appropriate for all elevated populations of non-native species. One such example requiring intervention strategies is the infestation of

 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> in the Victorian grassland communities. As a consequence, the study presented here was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of four different intervention attempts to control 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic>: herbicide control with glyphosate; organic herbicide control with pine oil; the application of mulch; and addition of seeds of native species to the seedbank. In addition, all possible combinations of these techniques were tested. The management techniques examined in this study had a significant effect on both the cover percentage and number of viable 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> seeds in the soil seedbank at six and 18 months after application of the various treatments, but the complexity of the treatment results indicates that the development of optimal management approaches needs to be carefully considered.
