 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], since this treatment by itself does not usually result in an increased density of native species. It is possible that a larger increase in native plant cover may have been obtained if the introduction of the native seeds into the degraded area was made at a later time following the other treatments, (for example, one to three years after herbicide or mulch treatments, instead of simultaneously combined with the other treatments). This may have allowed time for the various combined treatments of herbicide, mulch or pine oil to achieve a greater reduction in seed bank weed seed density prior to re-seeding, thereby reducing potential competition of the weed with native species. Other authors have suggest that for ecosystems in a highly degraded state, rehabilitation efforts should first focus on removing the infestation of invasive species by the use of herbicides or biological controls [
