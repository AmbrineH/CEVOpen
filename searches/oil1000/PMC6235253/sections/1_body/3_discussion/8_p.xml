<p class="p">One of the most challenging issues in natural resource management is the control of elevated or unbalanced populations of introduced species into native vegetation communities and degraded land. Although substantial financial and other resources been directed towards the control of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic>, natural resource management agencies in Victoria still struggle to manage the elevated populations. In this project we attempted to develop a suitable control method for this aggressive invasive species at landscape level. It can be concluded that application of treatments were most effective in reducing the population of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> when applied in combinations of multiple treatments. While our results did not assess the management costs associated with these various control practices, it is strongly suggested that a suitable combination of treatments would provide an ecologically and economically effective approach for control of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> over the long term, and therefore this approach should be further researched for the control of other perennial invasive weedy species.
