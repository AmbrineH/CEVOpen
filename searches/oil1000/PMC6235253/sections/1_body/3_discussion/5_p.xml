<p class="p">In the case of glyphosate application, this non-selective herbicide was the only established chemical method used either independently or in combination to reduce foliage cover and seedbank density. It was found that this treatment was most effective in the short-term in reducing foliage cover of mature plants. There was some regrowth six months after the glyphosate treatment and further recovery by 18 months, although the total foliage cover was significantly reduced at each post-treatment time, compared to the control plots. This finding is in line with Cook [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], who showed that glyphosate application was relatively ineffective for control of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> if applied in spring, but moderately effective if applied in early and mid-autumn. In this study, it was suggested that the poor efficacy of application in spring was compounded by early signs of moisture stress, thus this ‘timing’ effect needs to be re-investigated without the interference of such secondary effects. The findings of Cook [
 <xref rid="pone.0203653.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] support the continued use of autumn application of glyphosate, in combination with other treatments, to reduce infestations of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic>.
