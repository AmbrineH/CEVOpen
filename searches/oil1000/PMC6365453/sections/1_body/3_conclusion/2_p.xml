<p class="p">Based on these findings, (E,E)-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatrienyl decanoic acid, (+)-3-O-myristoyl-L-1-isovalerin, lacinilene C, hercynine, and 10-(Î²-dimethyl-aminopropionyl) phenothiazine were the lipids found only in the CO oleoresin. This study has its limitation, where the compounds were only tentatively identified using the LCMS technique. Based on the relative abundance value, a higher level of the long-chain fatty acid such as dihydroxystearic acid was observed in the CO oleoresin than in the oil. Although many compounds are considered as unknown, they have not been identified in the CO fat samples. Future studies may focus on the characterization and identification of these two major unknowns in the CO fat using other analytical technique or a more advanced technology.</p>
