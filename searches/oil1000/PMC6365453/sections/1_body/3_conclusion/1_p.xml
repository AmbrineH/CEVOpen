<p class="p">The LC-ESI-MS analysis gave a full insight into the potent functional compounds and nutritional components in the SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracted CO oil and oleoresin. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the ideal type of organic solvent for the extraction of fat-soluble compounds from plant materials. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracted CO fat samples had lauric acid, myristic acid, and Î±-linolenic acid as the major fatty acids in both CO oil and oleoresin. 1-Monolinolein was also the major glyceride in the fat samples; it contains a single fatty acid chain that was covalently bonded through an ester linkage to a glycerol molecule. Two unknown compounds and a peptide (His-Met-Lys) were tentatively identified as the main components of the fat samples. Besides these compounds, phenolics, terpenoids, volatiles, and other aromatic compounds were tentatively identified in both CO oil and oleoresin.
