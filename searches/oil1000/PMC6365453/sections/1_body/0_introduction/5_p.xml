<p class="p">Extraction method and type of solvent used are essential for extracting nutrients and phytochemicals from a high-fat fruit. As dabai is a high-fat fruit, the fruit pulp contains both polar and non-polar phytochemicals. Although methanol has been recognized as the widely used solvent for extraction and isolation of chemical components from plants, it is known to be toxic to the human body if ingested in even a small amount. The use of greener solvents such as water and carbon dioxide is recommended. However, water is a polar solvent, and it is hydrophilic. For that reason, supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) is the best to be used for extracting nutrients and phytochemicals with a wide range of polarity from any sources (Mukhopadhyay, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is also non-toxic and recyclable. The solubility behavior of the non-polar phytochemicals in SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has been reported in a previous study (Güçlü-Üstündag and Temelli, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). The study reported that the solubility of the compounds is dependent on the operating conditions. The use of an optimized extracting condition warrants optimal extraction yield with more types of chemical components isolated from a plant sample.
