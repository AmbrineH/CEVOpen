<p class="p">So far, except for the proximate analyzes and antioxidant properties and the determination of fatty acid and amino acid profile, as well as selected vitamins and minerals, limited studies have been done on the chemical analysis of CO oil. There has been no report on the chemical properties of SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracted CO oil and oleoresin. Due to the lack of data for the complete identification of phytochemicals or plant metabolites and nutritional components in SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracted CO oil and oleoresin, there is a need to characterize and to identify potential chemical components in the fat samples. This study was also performed to identify fatty acids, peptides, and potential phytochemicals in CO oil and oleoresin using LC-ESI-MS technique, as well as to quantify the fatty acid composition in the oil and oleoresin. Moreover, this is the first study on the qualitative analysis of chemical components in CO oil and oleoresin.
