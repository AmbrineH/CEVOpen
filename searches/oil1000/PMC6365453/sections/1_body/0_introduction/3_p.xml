<p class="p">The extracts of defatted CO pulp have been shown to possess antioxidative properties and cardioprotective effects (Khoo et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The defatted CO pulp contained anthocyanins as the major antioxidants. The anthocyanin-rich defatted CO pulp significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol and plasma LDL-cholesterol of the hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared to the positive control (Shakirin et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012b</xref>). Aqueous extract of CO leaves was also able to reduce high blood pressure through vasodilation of the rat thoracic aorta (Basri et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>).
