 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012a</xref>) reported that CO oil brought about a significant improvement in lipid profile (increased plasma HDL-cholesterol, and reduced plasma LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels), as well as reduced TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) level and favorable changes in the levels of plasma malonaldehyde, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant status. The oil had a total phenolic content of 20.27 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g oil. The high amount of phenolic compounds determined in CO pulp oil could contribute to the protective effect of the fruit
