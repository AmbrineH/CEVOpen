<p class="p">Nutritional values and antioxidant properties of the CO fruit have been reported in our previous studies. The CO pulp has a high oil content (Chew et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The fat content of CO fruit ranged between 21.16 ± 4.71 and 25.76 ± 3.03 g/100 g fresh weight. According to Azlan et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), the CO pulp contained 44.4% total saturated fats, 42.8% total monounsaturated fats, and 12.8% total polyunsaturated fats. Besides total fatty acids, the study also reported that the CO oil had, as the main fatty acids, 36.1% palmitic acid, 5.8% myristic acid, 41.5% oleic acid, and 11.8% linoleic acid. In addition to the balanced fatty acid composition, CO pulp had moisture, total available carbohydrate, protein, and ash content of 50.4–51.9%, 4.5–9.2%, 3.5–5.2%, and 1.7–1.9%, respectively; mineral content, amino acid composition, as well as antioxidative properties, were also determined in the CO pulp (Chew et al.,
