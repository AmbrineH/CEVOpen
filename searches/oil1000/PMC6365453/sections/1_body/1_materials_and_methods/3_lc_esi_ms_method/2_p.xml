<p class="p">Several trials were conducted to optimize the chromatographic conditions prior to the actual analysis by the application of different compositions and gradients of mobile phases. The gradient was run as follows: 5–90% B for 35.0 min, 90–90% B for 6 min, 90–5% for 0.1 min, and 5–5% for 6.9 min. The total run time for the LCMS analysis was 48 min, with a 13-min post-run time. The ionization conditions were adjusted to a capillary temperature of 300°C and 4000 voltage. The nebulizer pressure was 45 psi, and the nitrogen flow rate was 10 l/min. All mass spectrometry data were recorded in both positive and negative ion modes. The acquisition rate was 1.03 spectra/s across the ranges of 100–1000
