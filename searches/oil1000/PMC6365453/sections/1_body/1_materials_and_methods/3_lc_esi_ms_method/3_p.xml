<p class="p">Both CO samples were subjected to the LCMS Q-TOF in positive and negative ion modes for the profiling of the compounds or metabolites present in CO oil and oleoresin based on one replicate. Initially, the available plant metabolites were tentatively identified through the matching of masses of the compounds with the PlantCyc database. The MS mass tolerances were set between 0.05 and 0.1 Da. All the exact masses of unknown metabolites were further compared with the other online chemical databases (PubChem, LIPID MAPS, and ChemSpider), as well as some published scientific articles. The analysis was only focused on the electron ionization MS ranged between 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 100 and 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 1,000. The LCMS analysis was performed by the Proficient Lab Malaysia (Selangor, Malaysia) and the tentative identification of the compounds in the methanolic extracts of CO fat samples was done with the help of a chemist from the company.
