<p class="p">An Agilent 1290 Liquid Chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) coupled with a 6520 Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer was used to separate compounds from the methanolic extracts of CO oil and oleoresin. The mass detector was a Q-TOF accurate mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface and controlled by the MassHunter software. In brief, 2 μl of the sample solution comprising a mixture of compounds were loaded on a 2.1 mm (I.D.) Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus C-18 (100 mm in length) analytical column (with a particle size of 1.8 μm) that was maintained at 25°C. The analysis (positive mode) was performed by applying a gradient run that comprised mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile phase B (100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid), with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. As for the negative mode, the mobile phases used were mobile phase A (0.1% ammonium formate in water) and mobile phase B (100% acetonitrile).</p>
