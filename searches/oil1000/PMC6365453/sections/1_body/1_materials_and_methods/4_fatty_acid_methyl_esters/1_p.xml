<p class="p">Analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was performed based on the IUPAC 2.301 protocol (IUPAC, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1987</xref>). Briefly, FAMEs were analyzed and determined using the Waters Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector. The GC column used was Agilent DB-23 Capillary GC Column, 60 m × 0.25 mm, id 0.25 μm (J&amp;W Scientific, Inc., CA, USA). The temperatures for injector and detector were 130 and 220°C, respectively. The nitrogen carrier gas flow was set at 0.53 ml/min. Fatty acid content in CO oil and oleoresin was quantified and determined based on the FAMEs.
