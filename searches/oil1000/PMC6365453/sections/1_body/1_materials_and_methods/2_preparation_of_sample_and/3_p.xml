<p class="p">The extraction of CO oil was done using the extractor with a volume of 500 ml. Before the injection of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into the extraction vessel, 50 kg of the lyophilized sample was inserted into the vessel. The extraction was done based on the optimized conditions for CO oil extraction as follows: an extraction pressure of 40 MPa and an extraction temperature of 40Â°C. The flow of SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was maintained at 15 g/min, and the static duration was set to 30 min. The CO pulp powder was soaked in the vessel containing the SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at high pressure for 30 min. After 30 min of soaking, the oleoresin and oil were removed from the separation vessel via a manual valve after the extraction was completed. The extraction process took a total of 2 h. The extracted oil was collected as CO oil, and the semi-solid fraction was collected as CO oleoresin. Extraction of oil was performed in three replicates.
