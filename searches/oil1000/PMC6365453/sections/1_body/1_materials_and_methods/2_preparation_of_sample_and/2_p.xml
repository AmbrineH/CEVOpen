<p class="p">We have previously optimized the SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction conditions and established a laboratory protocol for the CO fat extraction (Jelani et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, the extraction of CO fat was done based on the semi-pilot scale, and the optimized extraction condition was applied. In this study, CO fat was extracted from the CO pulp powder using the SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extractor. The extraction was done by the automated system with the heater set to 40Â°C and with an extraction pressure of 40 MPa.
