<p class="p">Semi-polar extracts of the collected oil and oleoresin were obtained by extraction with aqueous methanol. The extraction was previously optimized using several extraction solvents, although methanol was found to be the ideal extraction solvent for extracting phytochemicals from CO oil, especially polyphenols, terpenoids, and glycosides (Biswas et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The chemical components of CO oil and oleoresin were extracted using aqueous 95% methanol (1:10

The methanolic extracts were filtered using 0.45 nm Sartorius syringe filters before being subjected to liquid chromatography analysis. Triplicate extraction was performed on both samples.
