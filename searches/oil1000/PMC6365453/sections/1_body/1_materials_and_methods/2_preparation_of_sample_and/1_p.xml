<p class="p">The CO fruit (200 kg) was purchased from an identified supplier through Semongok Agriculture Research Centre, Sarawak. About 100 kg of blanched CO pulp (at 60Â°C for 15 min) was obtained upon removal of the kernel. The CO pulp was freeze-dried using a benchtop freeze-drier (Virtis, NY, USA), and the lyophilized pulp was pulverized using a household blender (Panasonic, Malaysia) and sieved by a 20-mesh plastic sieve. Lipids from the lyophilized samples were extracted using an ABRP200 SCO
