<p class="p">Based on the FAMEs analysis, the main component of CO oil was palmitic acid (41.53 ± 0.13%), followed by oleic acid (38.79 ± 0.01%), and (cis) linoleic acid (11.95 ± 0.01%). The fatty acid composition of the CO oil was quantified and tabulated in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. CO oil was characterized as SFA-rich oil due to its high SFA composition (47.62 ± 0.13%). However, the MUFA and PUFA in CO oil cannot be disregarded. CO oil contained 39.93 ± 0.16 % MUFA and 12.48 ± 0.01% PUFA. Among the SFA, no short-chain fatty acids were detected in the oil.
