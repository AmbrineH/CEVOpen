 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 283). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, both of these MUFAs were detected in the two fat samples with RT of 34.13 min (peak 39) and 35.46 min (peak 44). Palmitoleic acid (9-hexadecenoic acid) is an omega-7 MUFA with molecular formula C

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. It is an important fatty acid for the human body as it is made up of 5.6% of human epidermis (Carruthers, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1964</xref>). Besides the C16 MUFA, oleic acid (octadecenoic acid) was another MUFA found in the CO oil and oleoresin. Oleic acid in its cis-9 form was tentatively identified in the chromatograms of both positive and negative ionization modes, with the electron ionization MS of both cation and anion at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 283 and 281, respectively. In fact, cis-9-oleic acid is the common fatty acid in plant oil (D'Evoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Oleic acid is a C18 MUFA with various applications in the food industry and plays an important role in lipase synthesis. It has been reported to be able to induce lipase production during food processing, especially in the dairy industry (Aravindan et al.,
