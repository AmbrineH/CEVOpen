<p class="p">Based on the results obtained, the SFA composition in the CO oil was mainly long-chain fatty acids. Although some of the carbon chains such as C15, C17, C21, and C23 are rarely found in fruit oils, these fatty acids were detected based on the carbon chains. Therefore, LCMS analysis was performed to confirm the existence of these fatty acids. The LCMS data showed that the fatty acids with carbon chains of C20â€“C24 were not detected in both CO oil and oleoresin. These carbon chains could be derived from the other types of lipid or hydrocarbon-containing compounds.</p>
