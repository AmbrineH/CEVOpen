 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) were tentatively identified in both CO oil and oleoresin. For the comparison between α-linolenic acid and γ-linolenic acid, a higher relative abundance value was observed for α-linolenic acid than the value observed for γ-linolenic acid. Besides the relative abundance values, γ-linolenic acid eluted at 0.7 min faster than α-linolenic acid. Based on the report by Momchilova and Nikolova-Damyanova (

Therefore, a γ-linolenic acid which had the double bond with a shorter neighboring carbon chain (26.41 min) eluted faster than α-linolenic acid with a longer carbon chain (27.11 min).
