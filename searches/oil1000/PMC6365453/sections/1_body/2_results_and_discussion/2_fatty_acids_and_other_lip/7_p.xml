<p class="p">Besides these main fatty acids, their isomers, hydroxylated, dihydroxylated, trihydroxylated, and epoxylated forms of fatty acids, as well as other chemical conformations, were tentatively identified for the CO oil and oleoresin. As shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) was a large compound, and it has capric acid as its base unit. This compound was only detected in CO oleoresin. Although capric acid (decanoic acid) was not detected in the fat samples, our finding shows that it existed in methylated forms. Due to the data being obtained from the anionic and cationic masses, we were not able to determine the position of all methylated fatty acids. Besides the anion of peak 36, (+)-3-O-myristoyl-L-1-isovalerin (peak 35, [M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> at

In addition to these findings, the results show that the identified monoglycerides and diglycerides were part of the fat components in CO oil and oleoresin.
