<p class="p">In this study, we found a desirable level of isanic acid in CO oil and oleoresin. Isanic acid, also known as erythrogenic acid (C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">26</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), was tentatively identified as peak 18 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). It had protonated molecular ion [M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 275, and it was detected only in CO oil. However, 8-hydroxyisanic acid (C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">28</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) was found in both of the CO fat samples, with the RT of 26.07 min (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Isanic acid is also a less common fatty acid found in vegetable oil. It had been first detected in 
 <italic class="italic">Ongokea gore</italic> seed (isano) oil from African countries (Ntumba et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). It is known as a non-edible fatty acid. The literature showed that isanic acid turns to a vivid red when exposed to light at increasing temperature (Black and Weedon, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1953</xref>). It also contributes to the color of the oil besides carotenoids. Although isanic acid was detected in the CO oil, our previous study proved that the oil is not hepatotoxic (Faridah Hanim et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
