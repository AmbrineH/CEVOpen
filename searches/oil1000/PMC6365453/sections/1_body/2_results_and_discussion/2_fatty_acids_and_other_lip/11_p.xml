<p class="p">Five diglycerides were detected in both fat samples (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Although these diglycerides could have several chemical conformations, lipid with the masses found may only correspond to the structures of diglycerides as suggested in the LIPID MAPS database. According to the database from LIPID MAPS, a lipid with monoisotopic mass of 624 Da and the formula of C

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> may correspond to DG(17:2(9Z,12Z)/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z) or DG(15:1(9Z)/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z). The LIPID MAPS database also suggested that anions of peaks 45 and 49 could be triglycerides. However, only one of these diglycerides was found in the CO oil, which had the molecular formula of C
