<p class="p">In this study, lauric acid, myristic acid, Î±-linolenic acid, dihydroxystearic acid, and epoxy-hydroxystearic acid were relatively abundant in the fat samples. These compounds can be considered as the major fatty acids in CO oil and oleoresin due to their high relative abundance values. Based on these findings, we could conclude that CO oil and oleoresin have a balanced fatty acid composition, with almost equal levels of SFA, MUFA, and PUFA. The relative abundance values also proved that major fatty acids were tentatively identified as methyloctanoic acid (a methylated form of caprylic acid), palmitic acid, oleic acid, oxo-oleic acid, trihydroxyoctadecenoic acid, hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid, hydroxy-oxo-octadecadienoic acid, octadecenedioic acid, stearidonic acid, octadecadiynoic acid, and heneicosanedioic acid. The levels of these long-chain fatty acids especially epoxy-hydroxystearic acid and dihydroxystearic acid were found to be in a higher amount in CO oleoresin than in CO oil. The result shows that the level of dihydroxystearic acid was 2.35 times higher in CO oleoresin than in the oil. These long-chain fatty acids might contribute to the high viscosity of CO oleoresin compared to that of the CO oil.</p>
