 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) was the only major glyceride in the fat samples. Monoolein was also found to be relatively abundant in the fat samples. In addition to these fatty acids, lanosterol and its hydroxyl forms were tentatively identified in both of the CO fat samples. As shown in
