<p class="p">Among the SFAs identified in this study, margaric acid was detected at RT of 32.08 min (peak 32, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). It is also known as heptadecanoic acid. The cation of this fatty acid was tentatively identified as 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 293. It was only found in CO oil. All the other types of SFA were also tentatively identified in both CO oil and oleoresin. Although margaric acid seldom occurs in vegetable fat, it was found in CO oil at low concentration (based on the relative abundance value).
