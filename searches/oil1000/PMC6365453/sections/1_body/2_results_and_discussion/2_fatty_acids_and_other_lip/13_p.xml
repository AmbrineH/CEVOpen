<p class="p">Lauric acid is one of the medium-chain triglycerides that was detected in the CO fat samples in a relatively high amount. Previous studies showed that a diet rich in lauric acid is less likely to promote obesity. Lauric acid was also found to be able to improve the lipid profile from the experimental trials (McCarty and DiNicolantonio,

Although myristic acid has only two carbon chains longer than those of lauric acid, it poses deleterious effects on human health. Same with palmitic acid, a diet rich in myristic acid could increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases following the rise of LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels in healthy men and women (Zock et al.,
