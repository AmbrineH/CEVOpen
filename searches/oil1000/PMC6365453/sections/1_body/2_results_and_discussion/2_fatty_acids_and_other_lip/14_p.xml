<p class="p">Previous studies reported that monoglycerides and diglycerides had protective effects against several chronic diseases (Feltes et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Due to the anti-diabetic and antiatherogenic effects of monoolein (Cho et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), the high level of monoglyceride in CO oil and oleoresin makes these fat samples as potential functional foods. Diglyceride is a prospective therapeutic agent for antiobesity. The effect is probably due to the increased Î²-oxidation of the fatty acids found during the metabolism of the diglyceride (Lo et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
