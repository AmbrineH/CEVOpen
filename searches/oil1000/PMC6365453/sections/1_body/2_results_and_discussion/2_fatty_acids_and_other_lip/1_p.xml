<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the identified fatty acids in CO oil and oleoresin were saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The SFAs (C8â€“C17) identified were caprylic acid (C8:0), lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), and margaric acid (C17:0). Caprylic acid is a common eight-carbon fatty acid, which is abundantly found in coconut oil (Marina et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Its systematic name is octanoic acid or caprylic acid. This fatty acid had a retention time of 19.14 min. Its anion was detected at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 143. Lauric acid, also known as dodecanoic acid, retained as peak 36 of the negative ionization mode, which had 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 199 (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 2</bold>). Similar to palmitic acid and myristic acid, both of these compounds detected at the chromatogram of negative ionization mode, had MS base peak at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 255 and 227, respectively. However, palmitic acid was detected in the chromatogram of both ionization modes.
