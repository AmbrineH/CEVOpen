<p class="p">The saturated carbon chains detected were C8, C11, and C12. These carbon chains were determined as caprylic acid, undecanoic acid, and lauric acid, as well as long carbon chains C14-C24. Based on the carbon chains, these fatty acids should be known as long-chain fatty acids. The fatty acids were named as follows: myristic acid (C14), pentadecanoic acid (C15), palmitic acid (C16), heptadecanoic acid (C17), stearic acid (C18), arachidic acid (C20), heneicosanoic acid (C21), behenic acid (C22), tricosanoic acid (C23), and lignoceric acid (C24).</p>
