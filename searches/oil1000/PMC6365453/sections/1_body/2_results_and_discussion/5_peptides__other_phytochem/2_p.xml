<p class="p">In nature, peptides are short-chain-linked amino acids with specific functions. The shortest peptide consists of two amino acids, whereas the peptide chain can be as long as a chain of 50 amino acids. In fact, peptide sequencing is typically performed using MALDI-MS. In this study, the three amino acid peptides were tentatively identified. Although these identified peptides do not have known functional properties, peptides have been reported to possess protective effect against
