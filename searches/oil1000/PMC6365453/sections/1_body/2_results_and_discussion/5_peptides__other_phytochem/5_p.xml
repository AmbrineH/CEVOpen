<p class="p">Two unknown compounds were found to be the major compounds in the fat samplesâ€”they were relatively abundant in both CO oil and oleoresin. One of the compounds had a molecular formula of C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">34</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, while the molecular formula of another unknown compound was determined. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, these unknown compounds retained at RT 28.3 min and 35.1 min, respectively. Also, some were the fragment ions of an unknown compound. As this is the first study conducted to identify potential chemical substances and phytochemicals in the CO oil and oleoresin, we merely reported the compounds identified in the CO oil and oleoresin based on the monoisotopic masses obtained from the LC-ESI-MS analysis.
