<p class="p">The detection of this compound in the CO oil could be due to fungal contamination on the CO peel. On top of fungal contamination, 10-(Î²-Dimethyl-aminopropionyl) phenothiazine, which is possibly derived from pesticide, was detected in the CO oleoresin. During the searching and matching of monoisotopic masses of the compounds with the available chemical databases, we found many unmatched compounds. Therefore, these unmatched compounds were named as unknowns. These unknowns had monoisotopic masses ranged between 202.17 and 646.45 Da.</p>
