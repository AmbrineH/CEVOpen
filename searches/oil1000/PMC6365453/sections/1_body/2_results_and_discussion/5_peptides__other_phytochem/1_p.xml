<p class="p">In this study, we tentatively identified a few peptide fragments in the CO oil and oleoresin. These peptide fragments had monoisotopic masses of 340.2–414.2 Da (

Peptides with the molecular weights of higher than 1,000 Da were not able to be identified in the oil samples. It is due to our mass searching technique which was based only on the PlantCyc database and some major online chemical databases. Nevertheless, we had no access to the database for peptide sequences. Therefore, the peptides with more than three amino acids and polypeptides remained unknown. This study makes way for other researchers to work on the peptide sequencing for CO oil.
