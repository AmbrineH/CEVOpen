<p class="p">Besides peptides, eight other known compounds were tentatively identified in the fat samples (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The results showed that hercynine ([M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 198) and 10-(β-dimethyl-aminopropionyl)phenothiazine ([M–H]
 <sup class="sup">−</sup> at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 298) were only found in the CO oleoresin. These compounds are the novel compounds identified in the fruit oil. Hercynine is the intermediate compound of ergothioneine biosynthesis in fungus (Askari and Melville, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1962</xref>). The other six organic compounds detected in the CO fat had [M–H]

 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 226 and 493 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), was a novel fatty acid derivative that was abundantly found in the fat samples. It was also one of the major compounds in the CO fat samples.
