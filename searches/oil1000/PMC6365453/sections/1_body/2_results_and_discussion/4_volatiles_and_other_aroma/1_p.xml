 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the volatiles and other aromatic compounds identified in the CO oil and oleoresin. The use of LCMS in detecting volatiles causes a loss of most known volatiles in the fat samples. The commonly known volatiles identified in both CO oil and oleoresin were cuparene ([M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 202) and hexadecenal ([M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 238). In this study, 4-(2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3,5-dimethylphenol ([M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 196) and 1,2-dioctanoyl-1,2,3-butanetriol ([M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> at 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 358) were tentatively identified as the novel volatiles in CO oil. The volatiles were not detected in CO oleoresin. In addition to volatiles, other aromatic compounds ([M+H]
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) identified in the fat samples were deoxyshikonin (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 273, peak 10), 4-prenylphlorisovalerophenone (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 279, peak 25), demethylphylloquinol (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 439, peak 33), and demethylphylloquinone (
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 437, peak 34), found based on positive ionization mode (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The other quinol-based compounds identified were also not found in most of the commercial fruits.
