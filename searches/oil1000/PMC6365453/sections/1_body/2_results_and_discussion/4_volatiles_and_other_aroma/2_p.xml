<p class="p">Literature shows that more than 30 volatiles were tentatively identified in the fruit of 
 <italic class="italic">Canarium pimela</italic> (Lv et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The fruit is from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Canarium</italic>, which should have a similar characteristic as found in the CO fruit. However, the volatiles found in the samples were far lesser than the volatiles reported in the previous study. It could be due to the loss of most of the volatiles in the sample during the SCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction of the CO oil. Therefore, only cuparene and hexadecenal were the major volatiles retained in the fat samples. This observation is supported by the finding from a previous study, where supercritical fluid extracted essential oils had lower percentages of volatiles than the essential oils extracted using simultaneous distillation-extraction apparatus (DÃ­az-Maroto et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>).
