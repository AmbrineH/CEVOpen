<p class="p">A sensitive, accurate, and specific method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ESI-MS was developed for the separation and tentative identification of compounds found in the semi-polar fraction (which consists of polar and non-polar compounds) of the fat samples. The molecular masses were assigned by ESI-MS. The subsequent structural characterization was carried out by a tandem mass spectrometric method. The accurate mass and fragmentation behavior of the compounds were investigated using ESI-Q-TOF in negative and positive ion modes.</p>
