<p class="p">Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) combines the techniques of physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography with mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. This application is oriented toward the general detection and tentative identification of potential compounds in a plant mixture (Khoo et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). MS measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles. It is used for determining masses of particles and the elemental composition of a sample or molecule, as well as for elucidating the chemical structure of molecules. Fatty acids, lipid metabolites, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, peptides, and other chemical components in the extracts of CO fat samples were tentatively identified based on the available plant metabolites and chemical databases.
