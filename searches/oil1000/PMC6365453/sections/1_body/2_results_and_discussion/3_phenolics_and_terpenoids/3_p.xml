<p class="p">The yellow hue of CO oil could be contributed by both apocarotenal and isanic acid. A previous study reported that apocarotenal has provitamin A activity (Bagdon et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1962</xref>). It is considered an intermediary of the conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A. Although the provitamin A activity is not as high as β-carotene, consumption of CO may improve the plasma vitamin A status of a healthy individual. Prasad et al. (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) also reported that a moderate amount of β-carotene was determined in the saponified extract of CO fruit. In addition to the apocarotenal, carotenoids were not identified in the CO fat due to several reasons, one of which is that carotenoids occur in the plant as carotenoid-protein complexes and carotenoid glycosides (Jürgens and Weckesser,
