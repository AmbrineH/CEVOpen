<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and apocarotenoids were tentatively identified in the CO oil and oleoresin. Based on the relative abundance value of the peak, a moderate level of hydroxy-apocarotenal (C

 <sub class="sub">36</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was retained at 35.3–35.4 min (
