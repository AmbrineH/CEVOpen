<p class="p">The phenolic compounds identified in most of the fat and oil were in semi-polar to non-polar forms. In this study, we managed to tentatively identify semi-polar coumaric acid and anisic acid as the main phenolic acids in CO oil and oleoresin. Although the relative abundance values of these phenolic acids were not as high as those observed in the major fatty acids, a low amount of these compounds has a good effect on human health because phenolics are strong antioxidants. Peak 3 was tentatively identified as the peak consisting of a mixture of flavonoids at RT of 19.36 min (
