<p class="p"> Acidity of vegetable oils is a qualitative parameter for determination of triacylglycerol hydrolysis and levels of free fatty acids (FFA). In the formulation of the oil blends, olive oil had the highest acidity among the investigated three oils. During the 90-day storage, all samples showed a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in acid value (

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup> virgin olive oil can have free fatty acid contents of up to 3.3%. High FFA content of oils makes them prone to oxidation and also reduces the smoking point which makes them less useable in food applications.
