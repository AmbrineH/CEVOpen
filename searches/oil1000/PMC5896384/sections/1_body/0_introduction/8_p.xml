 <sub class="sub">3</sub> essential fatty acids and nutritional properties, has received more attention in food formulation. However, linseed oil is very unstable oil and cannot be used alone in food preparations. In this research, linseed oil was blended with olive and sesame oils to obtain a functional oil with high bioactive compounds, optimal essential fatty acids and suitable stability during storage. The present research covers the evaluation of the chemical, nutritional and rheological properties of olive, sesame and linseed oils blends at different ratios and temperatures.
