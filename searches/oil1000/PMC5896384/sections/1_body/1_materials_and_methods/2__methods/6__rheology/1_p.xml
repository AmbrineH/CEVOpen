<p class="p"> An Anton Paar rheometer (Physica MCR 301, Anton Paar, GmbH, Graz, Austria) was used for the viscosity measurements. The measurements were performed at a shear rate of 1 to 100 s−1 at two temperatures, 4 ± 0.01°C and 25 ± 0.01°C. The Rheoplus Software (version 4.00, Physica MCR series, Anton Parr) was used as the device driver.</p>
