<p class="p">In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) isolated and identified the chemical constituents of volatile oil extracted by steam distillation from 
 <italic class="italic">Cichorium glandulosum Boiss et Huet</italic> (CG), a traditional Uyghur medicine, and to study its effects on carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. Thirty-eight compounds were identified from the volatile oil of CG (total, 98.058%), with terpenoids being the most abundant. In the animal model of liver fibrosis, all doses of volatile oil of CG significantly reduced the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline (Hyp), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and albumin (Alb).
