Terpenoids were the most commonly detected compounds, which showed that the volatile oils in the whole grass and seeds of CG were quite different. In addition to two interfering substances, the other 36 substances were identified to comprise almost 100% of the sample, and the relative content of all substances was 98.058%. On GC-MS, the main components were citronellol, rose ether, isoeugenol, alcohol, and caryophyllin. Therefore, the findings of this study could be used for the quality control of the aerial parts of the
