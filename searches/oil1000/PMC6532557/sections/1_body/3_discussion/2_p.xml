<p class="p">GC-MS showed that two materials, the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plasticizers, diisobutyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate, were found at the peak time of 58.775 min and 60.511 min. Extracts from these two materials could be filtered with plastic appliances before injection into the rat experimental model. According to recent reports [

 <xref rid="b11-medscimonit-25-3591" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], the electron ionization (IE) scanning sensitivity of the gas chromatograph used in the experiment included a 1L standard sample of octafluoronaphthalene at a concentration of 1 pg/L, which was injected and scanned in the mass range of 50â€“300 u. The anion at m/z 272, corresponded to deprotonated gamma-glutamyl-dehydroalanyl-glycine (EdAG). For the m/z 272 ion, the signal-to-noise ratio of turbine pump and diffusion pump was 400: 1 and 200: 1 respectively, which means that the possibility of detection of these two substances exists.
