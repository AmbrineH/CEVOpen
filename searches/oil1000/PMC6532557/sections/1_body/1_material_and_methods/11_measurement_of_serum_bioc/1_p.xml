<p class="p">Blood from the rat abdominal aorta was incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 1 h and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm. Serum was used to measure the levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), albumin (Alb), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), hydroxyproline (Hyp), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). All serum biochemical markers were were tested according to the instructions from the manufacturers of the kit. The ratio of AST to serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/GOT) was determined by Kim’s method. The ratio of ALT to glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) (ALT/GPT) was determined by Rye’s method. Serum Hyp was measured using an enzyme digestion method, and serum Alb was measured by bromocresol green colorimetry. Serum MDA was measured using the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method.</p>
