<p class="p">From each rat, part of the right lobe of the liver was fixed in 10% formalin. Tissues were processed and embedded in paraffin wax and tissue sections were cut onto glass slides. Sections of rat liver were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for light microscopy. Liver fibrosis was assessed histologically using the histochemical stain, elastic van Giesen (EVG). Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary antibodies to Smad7, Smad3, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-Î²1) and immunostaining was evaluated by light microscopy.</p>
