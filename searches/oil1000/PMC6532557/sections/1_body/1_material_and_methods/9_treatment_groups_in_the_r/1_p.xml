<p class="p">In the five model groups, there was one untreated model group (n=10), and four treated rat model groups included the volatile oil of CG high-dose group (0.15 ml/kg) (n=10), the volatile oil of CG medium-dose group (0.10 ml/kg) (N=10), the volatile oil of CG low-dose group (0.05 ml/kg) (n=10), and the silybin-treated group (0.20 ml/kg) (n=10). Treatment began on the fifth week following the development of the rat model of liver fibrosis and continued for 13. After 13 weeks, the rats fasted for 24 hours and then euthanized. Blood was collected from the abdominal aorta. Blood samples were centrifuged to obtain the serum, which was cryopreserved at −20°C. The liver and spleen were removed from each rat and weighed, and part of the liver was fixed in 10% formaldehyde at −80°C. Histological examination and immunohistochemistry were performed on the rat liver tissue sections.</p>
