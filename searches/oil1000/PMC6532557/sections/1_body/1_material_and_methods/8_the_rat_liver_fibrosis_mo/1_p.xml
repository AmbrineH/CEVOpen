<p class="p">In rats in the five model groups (n=50), 40% carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) in olive oil was injected in the back to develop the rat model of liver fibrosis. The first dose of CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> was 1.0 ml/kg, and then 0.5 ml/kg was injected twice weekly for 13 weeks. In the rat control group (n=10), rats were injected subcutaneously with an equivalent volume of normal saline, twice weekly for 13 weeks.
