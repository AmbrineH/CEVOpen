<p class="p">GC-MS was performed using a quartz capillary column. The heating program used an initial temperature of 40°C, increasing to 280°C at a rate of 5°C/min, with this temperature being maintained for 60 minutes until the analysis was completed. The carrier gas was helium, the inlet temperature was 240°C, the split ratio was 40: 1, and the injection volume was 10 L. The mass spectrometry conditions included a standard electron ionization (IE) source (70eV), an ion source temperature of 180°C, and an interface temperature of 240°C. The quadrupole mass analyzer had a scan range of 20–700 amu and a scan speed of 4.0 scans/sec).</p>
