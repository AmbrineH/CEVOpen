<p class="p">Compared with the normal control rat group, serum albumin levels in the model group were significantly reduced, and the concentration of MDA were significantly increased, indicating that the model was successful. Compared with the model group, the serum Alb levels of rats in the volatile oil of CG high-dose group were significantly increased, and the MDA concentration was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the model group, the serum Alb levels of rats in the volatile oil of CG medium-dose group were significantly increased (P&lt;0.05), and the MDA levels were reduced, but this finding did not reach statistical significance (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the model group, the serum Alb levels of rats in the volatile oil of CG medium-dose group were significantly increased (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between serum Alb levels and MDA levels (P&gt;0.05). The serum albumin levels and MDA levels in the silybin-treated group were also reduced. The result are shown in
