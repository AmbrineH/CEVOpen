<p class="p">The liver tissue from rats in the normal control group showed low expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5A1</xref>). The untreated model group showed the highest levels of expression of TGF-β1 in the liver tissue, mainly in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, and some in the cells around the central lobular vein and the fibrous septae (intensity score, ++) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5A2</xref>). In rat liver tissue from the model group treated with volatile oil of CG, the degree of immunostaining for TGF-β1 was reduced (intensity score, +) when compared with that found in the untreated model group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5A3</xref>). The expression intensity of the silybin-treated group was weaker than that of the model group, and was weakly positive (intensity score, +) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5A4</xref>). The results of semi-quantitative analysis of the immunostaining of liver tissue for the expression of TGF-β1 showed that the rats in the model group treated with volatile oil of CG had significantly reduced expression when compared with the untreated model group (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01) (
