<p class="p">Compared with the normal control rat group, the levels of LDH and γ-GT in the model group were significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), indicating that the model was successful. Compared with the model group, the serum levels of LDH and γ-GT in the volatile oil of CG high-dose group were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01). The serum levels of LDH and γ-GT in the volatile oil of CG medium-dose group and low-dose group were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05). The serum LDH and γ-GT levels in the silybin-treated group were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.01). The results are shown in
