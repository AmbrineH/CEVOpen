<p class="p">Compared with the normal control rat group, the serum levels Hyp (P&lt;0.05) and ALP (P&lt;0.01) in the model group were significantly increased, indicating that the rats had developed hepatic fibrosis and the model was successful. Compared with the model group, the levels of Hyp and ALP in the serum of the volatile oil of CG high-dose group were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in serum Hyp levels between the model group and the volatile oil of CG medium-dose group (P&gt;0.05), but there was a significant difference in ALP levels between the model group and the volatile oil of CG medium dose group (P&lt;0.01). Serum Hyp levels of the volatile oil of CG low-dose group were significantly increased (P&gt;0.05). Serum levels of ALP were significantly reduced when compared with the model group (P&lt;0.05). The serum levels of Hyp in the silybin-treated group were reduced when compared with the model group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (P&gt;0.05), but the serum levels of ALP were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05). The results are shown in
