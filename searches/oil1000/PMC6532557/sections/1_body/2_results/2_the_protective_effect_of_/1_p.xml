<p class="p">Compared with the normal control rat group, the liver and spleen coefficients of the rat model groups were significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), indicating that the model was successful. Compared with the model group, the liver coefficient and spleen coefficient of the volatile oil of CG high-dose treatment group was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01). Compared with the model group, the liver coefficient and spleen coefficient of the volatile oil of CG medium-dose treatment group was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01). Also, the liver coefficient of the volatile oil of CG low-dose treatment group was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05), while the spleen coefficient of the volatile oil of CG low-dose treatment group was reduced, but this did not reach statistical significance (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the model group, the liver and spleen coefficient of the silybin-treated group was significantly reduced. The results are shown in
