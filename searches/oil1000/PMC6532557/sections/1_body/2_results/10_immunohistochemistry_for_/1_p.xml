<p class="p">The liver tissue from rats in the normal control group showed weak expression of Smad3 (intensity score, Â±) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5B1</xref>). The strongest expression was found in the untreated rat model group, with positive immunostaining in the area around the central vein. In the hepatocytes, there was expression of Smad3 in the nucleus and cytoplasm. There was strongly positive expression of Smad 3in the untreated rat model group (intensity score, +++) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5B2</xref>). Immunostaining for Smad3 in the volatile oil of CG-treated rat model group was weaker than that of model group (intensity score, ++) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5B3</xref>). The expression of Smad3 in the silybin-treated group was significantly lower than that of the model group (intensity score, ++) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5B4</xref>). The results of semi-quantitative analysis of the immunostaining of liver tissue for the expression of Smad3 showed that the rats in the model group treated with volatile oil of CG had significantly reduced expression when compared with the untreated model group (p&lt;0.01) (
