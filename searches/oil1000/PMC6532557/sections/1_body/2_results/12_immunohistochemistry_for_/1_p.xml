<p class="p">Normal liver tissues from the normal control rat group showed very low expression of TLR4 (intensity score, Â±) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5D1</xref>). The expression of TLR4 in the untreated model group was strong, mainly in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. In the model group, TLR4 immunostaining was moderately positive (intensity score, ++) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5D3</xref>). The expression intensity of the silybin-treated group was weaker than that of the model group, and was weakly positive (intensity score, +) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5D4</xref>). The results of semi-quantitative analysis of the immunostaining of liver tissue for the expression of TLR4 showed that the rats in the model group treated with volatile oil of CG had significantly reduced expression when compared with the untreated model group (p&lt;0.01) (
