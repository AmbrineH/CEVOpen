<p class="p">Compared with the untreated model group, the degree of liver fibrosis in the high-dose group treated with volatile oil of CG was significantly reduced, and a small amount of collagen was present. There was a small amount of fibrous septum formation, but the degree of cell degeneration reduced, and there was no pseudolobule formation. The effects on reduction of liver fibrosis in the volatile oil of CG high-dose treatment group were significantly greater when compared with the low-dose and medium-dose volatile oil of CG-treated groups. These findings indicated that volatile oil of CG had a protective effect on the hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl
