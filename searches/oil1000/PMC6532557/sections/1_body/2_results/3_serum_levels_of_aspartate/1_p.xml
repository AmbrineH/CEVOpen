<p class="p">Compared with the normal control rat group, the serum levels of AST and ALT in the model group were significantly increased, which indicated that the model was successful. Compared with the model group, the levels of AST and ALT in the serum of rats in the volatile oil of CG high-dose group were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01). The serum levels of AST in the rats in the volatile oil of CG medium-dose group were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.01) and the levels of ALT were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05). The levels of AST in the serum of rats in the volatile oil of CG low-dose group were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05). The serum levels of ALT were reduced but this did not reach significance (P&gt;0.05). Serum AST and ALT levels in the silybin-treated group were significantly reduced when compared with the model group (P&lt;0.01). The results are shown in
