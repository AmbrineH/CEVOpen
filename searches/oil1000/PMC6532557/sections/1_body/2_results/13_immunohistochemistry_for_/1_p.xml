<p class="p">Normal liver tissues from the normal control rat group showed weak positive expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA) in vascular smooth muscle cells and cells in the periportal area of liver tissues (intensity score, +) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5E1</xref>). The rat liver tissue from the untreated model showed increased expression of ASMA, mainly in fibrous stromal cells of liver tissue (intensity score, +++) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5E2</xref>). The expression levels of ASMA in the rat model group treated with volatile oil of CG were significantly lower compared with the untreated model group (intensity score, +) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5E3</xref>). The intensity of immunostaining for ASMA in the silybin-treated group was significantly weaker when compared with the untreated model group (intensity score, +) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5E4</xref>). The results of semi-quantitative analysis of the immunostaining of liver tissue for the expression of ASMA showed that the rats in the model group treated with volatile oil of CG had significantly reduced expression when compared with the untreated model group (p&lt;0.01) (
