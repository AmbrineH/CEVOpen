<p class="p">The liver tissue from rats in the normal control group showed strong positive immunostaining for Smad7 (intensity score, +++) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5C1</xref>). Immunostaining for Smad7 was localized to the cytoplasm of normal hepatocytes, and there was no immunostaining of sinusoidal and interstitial cells. In the untreated rat model group, there was minimal positive immunostaining for Smad7 (intensity score, Â±) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5C2</xref>). In the rat livers from the rat model group treated with volatile oil of CG showed increased immunostaining for Smad7 (intensity score, ++) when compared with the untreated rat model group, and weaker immunostaining when compared with the normal control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5C3</xref>). The degree of positive immunostaining for Smad7 in the silybin-treated group (intensity score, +) was increased when compared with the untreated model group, and was weaker than that of the normal group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-25-3591" class="xref">Figure 5C4</xref>). The results of semi-quantitative analysis of the immunostaining of liver tissue for the expression of Smad 7 showed that the rats in the model group treated with volatile oil of CG had significantly increased expression when compared with the untreated model group (p&lt;0.01) (
