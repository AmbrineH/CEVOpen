<p class="p">In the normal control rat group, the histology of the liver was normal. In particular, the central vein could be identified and was associated with normal liver architecture and normal hepatocytes, without necrosis, inflammation, steatosis, or fibrosis (

The normal structure of the hepatic lobules was disorganized, with loss of the normal arrangement of the liver trabeculae, loss of liver sinusoids, and edema of the liver tissue. The hepatocytes were swollen and steatosis was present with intracellular fat droplets that varied in size. Some hepatocytes showed vesicular degeneration and necrosis (
