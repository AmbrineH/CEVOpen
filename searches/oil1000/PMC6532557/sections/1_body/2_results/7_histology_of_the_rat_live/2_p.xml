<p class="p">Compared with the untreated model group, in the rats treated with high-dose volatile oil of CG, there was reduced liver fibrosis and the normal liver architecture was preserved. There was some steatosis, and cell vacuolation, but edema, inflammation, and liver cell necrosis were reduced. Therefore, treatment with volatile oil of CG appeared to improved the morphological changes of liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) in the rat model. The effects of treatment with high-dose volatile oil of CG were more apparent when compared with the medium-dose and low-dose groups. These results indicated that the volatile oil of CG had a protective effect on hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) in rats (

The rat liver histology in the silybin-treated rat model group showed mild hepatic fibrosis with retained liver architecture that included discernible sinusoids, homogeneous cytoplasm of hepatocytes, a marked reduction of cell necrosis, and some vesicular degeneration (
