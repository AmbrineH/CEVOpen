<p class="p">In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified the components of the volatile oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Cichorium glandulosum Boiss et Huet</italic> (CG), a traditional Uyghur medicine, and identified a major component, citronellol. Treatment with volatile oil of CG reduced liver fibrosis in a rat model. Although citronellol has been reported to be a major bacteriostatic agent, its hepatoprotective effect has not previously been reported. The mechanism of the hepatoprotective effect of citronellol may occur by regulating the immune response in the liver through the intestinal route. The preliminary findings from this study in a rat model of liver fibrosis require further investigation using 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies.
