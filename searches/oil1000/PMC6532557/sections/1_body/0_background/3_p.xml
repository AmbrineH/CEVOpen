<p class="p">Therefore, this study aimed to use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to isolate and identify the chemical constituents of volatile oil extracted from CG by steam distillation and to compare its effects with silybin, the active component of silymarin extracted from

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. The liver and spleen coefficients, serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline (Hyp), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and albumin (Alb) were measured, and the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes of the liver were observed to investigate the hepatoprotective and anti-fibrotic effects of volatile oil extracted from CG.
