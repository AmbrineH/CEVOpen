<p class="p">Recently, the chemical constituents of CG and its clinical toxicological and pharmacological effects have been studied. It has been shown that CG has protective effects on liver fibrosis, but the mechanism of its pharmacological effects remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that CG contains flavone, sesquiterpene, coumarin, carbohydrates, and other active ingredients, which have strong biological activity and medicinal value [
