  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p class="p">This study aimed to use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the chemical constituents of volatile oil extracted by steam distillation from 
   <italic class="italic">Cichorium glandulosum Boiss et Huet</italic> (CG), a traditional Uyghur medicine, and to investigate its effects on carbon tetrachloride (CCl
   <sub class="sub">4</sub>)-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats.

  <p class="p">Sprague-Dawley rats (n=60) included six groups: the control group (n=10), untreated model group (n=10), the volatile oil of CG high-dose group (0.15 ml/kg) (n=10), the volatile oil of CG medium-dose group (0.10 ml/kg) (N=10), the volatile oil of CG low-dose group (0.05 ml/kg) (n=10), and the silybin-treated group (0.20 ml/kg) (n=10). Rats given the essential oil extract of CG by intragastric administration, and then subcutaneously injected with a solution of CCl
   <sub class="sub">4</sub> in olive oil to create the rat model of hepatic fibrosis. Serum samples were analyzed for markers of liver function, including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline (Hyp), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and albumin (Alb). Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on rat liver tissue.

  <title class="title">Results</title>
  <p class="p">Thirty-eight compounds were identified from the volatile oil of CG (total, 98.058%), with terpenoids, including citronellol, being the most abundant. In the animal model of liver fibrosis, all doses of volatile oil of CG significantly reduced the serum levels of AST, ALT, MDA, Hyp, γ-GT, LDH, ALP, and Alb.</p>

  <title class="title">Conclusions</title>
  <p class="p">GC-MS identified the components of the volatile oil of CG, which included citronellol. Treatment with volatile oil of CG reduced liver fibrosis in a rat model.</p>
