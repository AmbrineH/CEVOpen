 <p> Immunohistochemistry of rat liver tissues for the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), Smad3, Smad7, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA) in the rat model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4)-induced hepatic fibrosis. 1 – the normal rat group; 2 – the untreated rat model group; 3 – the rat model group treated with volatile oil of Cichorium glandulosum Boiss et Huet (CG); 4 – the rat model group treated with silybin. ( A) Immunohistochemistry shows the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) in the rat liver tissue. ( B) Immunohistochemistry shows the expression of Smad3 in the rat liver tissue. ( C) Immunohistochemistry shows the expression of Smad7 in the rat liver tissue. ( D) Immunohistochemistry shows the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the rat liver tissue. ( E) Immunohistochemistry shows the expression alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA) in the rat liver tissue. (n=10) (Mean ± SD). Compared with the normal group, @@ p&lt;0.01; compared with the model group, ** p&lt;0.01, * p&lt;0.05. </p>
