 <p> Histology of the liver tissues for hepatic fibrosis in the rat model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4)-induced hepatic fibrosis. ( A–D) Photomicrographs of the histology of the rat liver tissues show fibrosis. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and elastic van Giesen (EVG). Magnification ×200. ( A) Liver histology in the normal rat group. ( B) Liver histology in the untreated rat model group. ( C) Liver histology in the rat model group treated with volatile oil of Cichorium glandulosum Boiss et Huet (CG). ( D) Liver histology in the rat model group treated with silybin. The blue arrow in C shows hepatocyte steatosis; the black arrow in B, C, and D shows vesicular hepatocyte degeneration; the red arrow in D shows cell necrosis and loss of cell nuclei. </p>
