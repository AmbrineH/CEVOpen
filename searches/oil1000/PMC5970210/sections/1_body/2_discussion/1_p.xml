<p id="Par13" class="p">Although many investigations have explored the potential plant-derived acaricides for house dust mite control, their major limitation is that allergen-containing dead mites were not removed. Hence, in the present study, we focused on developing a mite indicator to completely remove the house dust mites from the affected area. The results of this study showed variation in the acaricidal activities of the three oils of

 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia with respect to geographical regions. 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> oil from France was more active against 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">farinae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pteronyssinus</italic>, compared to 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> oil cultivated in Ireland and Serbia. An interesting result was the color deformation effect of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> oils cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia against 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">farinae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pteronyssinus</italic>. Our results confirm that the bodies of house dust mites were obviously changed to golden brown from colorless, after treatment with the three oils of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> cultivated in France, Ireland, and Serbia (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In addition, the color alteration of the mites treated with 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">officinalis</italic> oil allowed 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">farinae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pteronyssinus</italic> to be distinguished with the naked eye. This reaction could be caused by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and tyrosinase
