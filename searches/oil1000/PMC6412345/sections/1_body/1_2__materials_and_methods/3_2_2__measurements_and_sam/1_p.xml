<p class="p">Throughout the experimental phase, water and food were provided ad libitum. Control of food intake was performed daily. Cows were milked twice daily (8:00 h and 16:00 h) and milk production (kg/day) was measured during the entire experimental period. Milk samples (morning and afternoon) were taken using an automatic collector once a month from each cow to determine the FA profile and during the last seven days to test the milkâ€™s oxidative stability and to conduct the sensory evaluation.</p>
