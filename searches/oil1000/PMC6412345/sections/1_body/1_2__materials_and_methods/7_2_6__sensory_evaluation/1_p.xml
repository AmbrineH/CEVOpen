<p class="p">The research project that this study originated from was submitted and approved (Opinion number 212.367) by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Animal Science and Food Engineering (FZEA), University of São Paulo (USP). Milk acceptability was determined by assessing the level of acceptance of color, odor, flavor, and mouthfeel using a nine-point hedonic scale (where 1 = really disliked, 5 = not liked nor disliked, 9 = really liked) [

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 60) were recruited from students (18 to 25 years) and staff at the FZEA to perform both tests. As milk consumption is prevalent at all ages in Brazil, the sole requirement for participation was to be a milk consumer. Prior to sensory evaluation, the milk was pasteurized (72 °C for 30 min) and standardized to 3% fat, but it was not homogenized. Milk was filled into 1 L sterile plastic containers that were hermetically sealed and identified in accordance with the dietary treatment. Milk samples of approximately 50 mL were served at 7 °C after manual mixing. Samples were coded with a 3 digit number and were randomly presented to assessors. Consumer studies usually involve a minimum of 100 participants [

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 60) may be regarded as a limitation of our study.
