<p class="p">Daily samples of the feed and orts were collected and pooled over 2-week periods; they were then mixed and sub-sampled for subsequent chemical analysis. The samples were dried at 55 °C in a forced-air oven for 72 h and grounded with a 1 mm screen mill (FZ102, Shanghai Hong Ji instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). DM (AOAC, 950.15), ash (AOAC, 942.05), ether extract (EE; AOAC, 920.39), crude protein (CP; AOAC, 984.13), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and lignin (AOAC, 973.18) were analyzed in the feed offered and in samples of orts according to the methods described by the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC International [
