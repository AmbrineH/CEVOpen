<p class="p">To determine the milk FA profiles, milk samples from each cow were initially centrifuged (17,800 × g, 20 min, 8 °C) to separate the fat. From the supernatant cream, 400 mg was transferred to a glass test tube, and fat extraction was conducted [

 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The separation of fatty acids was achieved by gas chromatography (Trace Model 2000, Thermo Finnigan®, Waltham, MA USA) using a SP-2560 fused silica capillary column (100 × 0.25 × 0.2 mm) and a flame-ionization detector. Hydrogen was used as a carrier gas (flow rate: 1 mL/min). Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The sample injection rate (split mode) was 25:1. Air flow was adjusted to 460 mL/min, and nitrogen flow (auxiliary gas) was 30 mL/min. The initial temperature was 70 °C, increasing to 175 °C after the first injection, and this was then maintained for 27 minutes. Finally, the temperature was raised to 215 °C (4 °C/min) and maintained for 21 minutes. Certified standard butter fat (CRM-164, Commission of the European Communities, Community Bureau of Reference, Brussels, Belgium) was used to determine the recovery of FA and to calculate correction factors. Concentrations of fatty acids are expressed as g/100 g of the total fatty acid concentration.
