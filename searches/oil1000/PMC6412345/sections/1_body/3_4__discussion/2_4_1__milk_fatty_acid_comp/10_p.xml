<p class="p">In terms of the health related lipid indices, following oil supplementation, the AI tended to decrease and h/H tended to increase. The lactation stage and genotype affected the fatty acid profile in terms of the milk’s health properties [
 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. These authors found higher values of AI in cow’s milk at the later stages of lactation (5.13) and lower values in the middle of lactation (4.08) and emphasized the importance of having low AI in milk for human consumption. The h/H index is the opposite of TI, because the higher the h/H is, the better nutrition is, and the lower the risk of cardiovascular disease is. A high plasma cholesterol level and the occurrence of coronary heart disease are strongly interrelated, and dietary supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is associated with a reduction in the incidence of occlusive vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and thrombosis [
