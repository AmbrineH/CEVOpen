<p class="p">Previous studies have demonstrated that supplementation of dairy cows with unsaturated oils increases the content of trans-18:1 fatty acids in milk fat [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The results of the present study are consistent with this pattern. Milk concentrations of the fatty acids 6 + 7 + 8 + 9t-18:1, 10 + 11 + 12t-18:1, 15c-18:1, and 16t-18:1 increased following supplementation with sunflower oil. Jenkins and Havartine observed that the high dietary supply of UFA exceeds ruminal capacity to biohydrogenate trans-18:1 fatty acids to stearic acid, promoting the accumulation of specific intermediates in the rumen which are then incorporated into the milk [
