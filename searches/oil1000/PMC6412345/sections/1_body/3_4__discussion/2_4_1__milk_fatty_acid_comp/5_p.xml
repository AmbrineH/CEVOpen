<p class="p">The concentration of 22:0 fatty acids tended to increase following supplementation with sunflower oil, and concentrations of stearic and rumenic acids (9c, 11t-18:2) also increased when cows were supplemented with oil. These fatty acids (stearic and rumenic) are important products of, respectively, the complete and incomplete biohydrogenation of 18C polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); therefore, these results agree with what was expected for cows supplemented with sunflower oil (rich in Ï‰6 PUFAs).</p>
