<p class="p">When antioxidants were supplemented with the oil, there were increased concentrations of 6 + 7 + 8 + 9t-18:1, 16t-18:1, 20:0, 22:2, 24:0, and 22:1ω9 fatty acids in milk. A similar effect was also found for the sum of ω6 fatty acids and the relation between ω6 and ω3, where there was a tendency for the values of these variables to increase following antioxidant supplementation in the presence of the oil. A study about fatty acids and cardiovascular disease showed that there are significant interactions between fatty acids, and the polyunsaturated/saturated ratio must be in the range between 0.5 and 1, and the ω6/ω3 ratio between 2 and 5 [

Analyzing this recommendation, the use of milk as food would be exceeding the recommended rate of the correlation between fatty acids due to the presence of a greater amount of saturated fatty acids, but on the other hand, it has an excellent relation between ω6 and ω3 fatty acids.
