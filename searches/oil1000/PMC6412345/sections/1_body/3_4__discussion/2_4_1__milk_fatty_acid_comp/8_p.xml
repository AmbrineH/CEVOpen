<p class="p">The bioaccessibility of cis-9, trans-11 18:2 was 87.0 ± 3.4% in a dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal model of lactating dairy cows fed safflower oil, and the bioaccessibility was higher for unsaturated FAs than for their saturated counterparts, and the degree of saturated FA absorption decreased with chain length [

In another study, the authors carried out an in vitro study of the bioavailability of fatty acids in cow’s milk containing conjugated linoleic acids produced in vivo or added in synthetic form and found that the bioavailability of 9c, 11t-18:2 in milk containing 3.25% fat reached 73%, 89%, 85%, and 71% for the control, and for cows fed 4% sunflower oil in the diet, enriched synthetic free fatty acids, and synthetic triacylglycerol-enriched milk, respectively.
 <sup class="sup">32</sup> Therefore, 9c, 11t-18:2 was more available in enriched milk by feeding the cow and confirming that CLA is efficiently absorbed in the human small intestine and could therefore confer the alleged health benefits [
