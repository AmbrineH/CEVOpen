<p class="p">The sum of CLA and CLnA tended to increase in milk following oil supplementation in the cows’ diet. Potential benefits to human health have attracted researchers’ attention towards the development of effective nutritional strategies to increase the CLA content in the fat of ruminant-derived foods [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. CLA isomers are formed during ruminal biohydrogenation of UFA or via the action of the ∆9-desaturase enzyme, which is present in the mammary glands, on 11t-18:1, another biohydrogenation intermediate [
 <xref rid="B10-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Oils rich in linoleic acid are considered excellent CLA sources. In this trial, we observed an increase of 0.24 g/100 g of 9c, 11t-18:2, the main CLA isomer, and 0.33 g/100 g of ∑CLnA, CLA for cows fed sunflower oil. A review on the components of milk in human health reported that CLA has demonstrated the ability to prevent different types of cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes as well as the ability to improve immune function and body composition in in vitro and in vivo studies [
