<p class="p">The major sources of SFA in the diet in most developed countries are milk and dairy products. When oilseeds and plant oils are included in the diet of lactating cows, SFA can be replaced with MUFA and PUFA in milk, offering a mechanism to lower SFA consumption in the human population [
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In the present experiment, supplementation with sunflower oil in the cowsâ€™ diet did not significantly alter SFA/UFA, although the lowest numerical value was for the oil supplementation treatment (2.44 with oil vs. 2.96 without oil), but there were several changes in the amounts of fatty acids within each category of fatty acids, with the decrease of some cholesterolemics and increase of CLA and CLnA.
