On the other hand, the medium chain fatty acids (C8 to C12) in milk are associated with beneficial effects that are linked to metabolic activities, such as risk reduction in the development of characteristics of the metabolic syndrome (dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and glucose intolerance, where insulin resistance is the central phenomenon and its co-occurrence is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease) [
