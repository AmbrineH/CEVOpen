<p class="p">This project was carried out concomitantly with a nutrition and human health trial, in which milk from this experiment was pasteurized and offered to elderly people aged over 70 years. Selenium and vitamin E doses were stipulated in the animal feed with the aim of increasing their concentrations in milk to reach the requirements of these nutrients for the elderly. The doses of these antioxidants in animal feed were above the required level, but below toxic doses. We did not intend to change the other parameters of milk composition (protein, lactose, and fat), but only aimed to increase the levels of selenium and vitamin E and to modify the profile of fatty acids in milk. The results of milk performance and composition will be published in another scientific article, but in summary, milk production was not affected by the various treatments, and only supplementation with sunflower oil tended to decrease the protein content in milk (
