<p class="p">The lack of significant differences among treatments in this study indicates that all diets provided similar amounts of antioxidants. Being fat-soluble, vitamin E levels are associated with the intake of lipids. In this study, diets with the inclusion of sunflower oil may have provided a sufficient amount of vitamin E to inhibit lipid oxidation in the milk from OA and O treatments, since oil seeds have considerable amounts of vitamin E in their composition. Charmley and collaborators studied the effect of supplemental vitamin E and selenium in the diet on the control of oxidized flavor in milk from Holstein cows and reported that only a proportion of cows (25%) produced milk that was susceptible to oxidation, and there was a trend toward a reduced oxidized flavor when vitamin E was given [
