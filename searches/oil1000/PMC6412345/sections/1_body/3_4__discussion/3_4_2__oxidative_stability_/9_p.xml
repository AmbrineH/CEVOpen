<p class="p">The type of processing to which milk is subjected can influence its color, particularly its whiteness [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Hayes and Kelly observed that homogenized milk becomes whiter [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], which may be related to the increased number of fat globules and a more efficient dispersion of light [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Homogenization of milk is a process through which the size of fat globules is reduced, whereas the opposite effect is observed for the surface area of fat globules [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. In this study, milk was not homogenized before or after heat treatment, explaining the positive perception by consumers regarding the color and mouthfeel of the milk from treatment with oil.
