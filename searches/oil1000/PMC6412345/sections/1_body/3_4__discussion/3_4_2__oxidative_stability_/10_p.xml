<p class="p">Khanal and collaborators studied the consumer acceptability of conjugated linoleic acid-enriched milk from cows grazing on pasture and suggested that the consumer acceptability attributes of CLA-enriched milk from cows grazing on pasture are similar to those of milk with normal levels of CLA from cows fed a conventional diet [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-11-00481" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In the present experiment, milk from cows supplemented with sunflower oil was preferred in terms of color and mouthfeel, indicating that it may have good acceptability by consumers in the dairy market.
