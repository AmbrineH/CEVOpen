 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) the contents of 10:0, 10:1, 11:0, 12:0, 12:1, 14:0, and 9c-14:1 fatty acids as well as odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (OBCFAs = 13:0, iso 13:0, anteiso 13:0, 15:0, iso 15:0, and 17:0). There was also a tendency for the concentration of 8:0 and 16:0 fatty acids to decrease following oil supplementation in the cowsÂ´ diet. Although oil supplementation decreased the concentration of some short and medium chain fatty acids (SMCFAs), it did not change the total amounts of saturated (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.184), unsaturated (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.173), monounsaturated (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.182), or polyunsaturated fatty acids (
