 <p> (A) Consequence of different concentrations of C. martinii essential oil (CMEO) on generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) of F. graminearum determined by the dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining method. Statistical data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA following Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparison test and columns with different letters were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05). (B) Phase-contrast and GFP (green fluorescent protein) images of control and CMEO-treated fungal samples. The scale bar value was 200 μm in all the images. </p>
