<p class="p">In conclusion, the antifungal effect of CMEO on 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> was confirmed by observing the micro-morphology of macroconidia by SEM at MIC and MFC values. The CMEO-treated macroconidia were exhibited some distinctive morphological features compared to control (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </bold>). The control macroconidia were healthy with homogenous, turgid, and smooth surface (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>
 </bold>). While CMEO-treated macroconidia showed detrimental micro-morphological features such as squashed, rough surface, collapsed, dispersed, wrinkled, protuberances, craters, and vesicles (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </bold>). Interestingly, severe detrimental micro-morphological changes in macroconidia were perceived at MFC compared to MIC value of CMEO (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B,C</xref>
 </bold>). The study concluded that antifungal activity of CMEO could be due to the detrimental impairment of micro-morphology of macroconidia, and it could be due to the upsurge of ROS and MDA levels, and exhaustion of membrane integrity and ergosterol content.
