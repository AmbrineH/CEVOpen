<p class="p">The conventional agriculture is quite often characterized by excess application of synthetic mycobiocides, which generally cause environmental pollution, health issues in humans and animals, and develop fungicide-resistant fungi (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lucas et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, researchers have given wide attention for discovery of alternatives to hazardous synthetic mycobiocides (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">George et al., 2016</xref>). Several researchers have found that plant-based mycobiocides are better alternatives for synthetic mycobiocides and especially, essential oils are non-toxic, biodegradable, “GRAS” and appropriate for sustainable agriculture (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burt, 2004</xref>). However, essential oils are highly volatile and easily degrade on exposure to light, heat, pH, moisture, and oxygen, and thus, deprive their stability and bio-functional properties. To overcome instability of essential oils, nanotechnologists have developed the technique of microencapsulation of essential oils with chitosan, alginates, zein protein, etc. Thus, microencapsulation safeguards the essential oils from degradation and enables its perseverance, and monitored and gradual release (
