 </bold>. It was noticed that the better-sustained release of CMEO at pH 7.4 than pH 1.5. For a period of 48 h, cumulative of 97.94 ± 0.95 and 43.37 ± 2.17% of CMEO was released from Ce-CMEO-NPs at pH 7.4 and pH 1.5, respectively. The reason might be the formation of highly stable bioactive complex of chitosan at acidic pH 1.5 (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cojocariu et al., 2012</xref>). It is observed that the release of essential oil is stabilized due to the complex formation with chitosan. The volatile alcohols and phenol groups of CMEO will be converted into its more stable complex forms by the chitosan encapsulation process which in turn increases their effective lifetime for fungicidal action by gradual release of antifungal constituents.
