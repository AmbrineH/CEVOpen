<p class="p">Antifungal and antimycotoxin activities of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> in maize grains were conducted under laboratory conditions over a storage period of 28 days. The CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs have presented potent fungicidal and antimycotoxin activities in maize grains (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </bold>). The kinetic curves for reductions of fungal growth and level of mycotoxins (DON and ZEA) with different concentrations of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs were depicted in 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </bold>. The constructed regression models were found satisfactory and presented a good determination coefficient (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of 0.9694 and 0.9896 (log CFU), 0.9864 and 0.9793 (DON), and 0.9935 and 0.9873 (ZEA) for CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs, respectively (Supplementary Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">1</xref>). These regression models conveyed that reductions of fungal growth and mycotoxins were dependent on the concentration of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs and show a dose-dependent fashion. Though, Ce-CMEO-NPs have exhibited potent antifungal and antimycotoxin activities compared to CMEO (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </bold>). The complete reductions of fungal growth and mycotoxins were noticed at 700 ppm of Ce-CMEO-NPs and 900 ppm of CMEO (

 </bold>). The essential oils are volatile and susceptible to degradation and loss of bio-functional features. Whereas essential oils encapsulated in chitosan are less prone to degradation, perseverance bio-functional properties, and gradually releases the bio-active elements in a controlled way (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Malešević, 2016</xref>). Consequently, Ce-CMEO-NPs are highly resistant to degradation, perseverance bio-functional features, and slowly release active antifungal constituents compared to CMEO. Henceforth, Ce-CMEO-NPs have exhibited potent antifungal and antimycotoxin activities compared to CMEO. In support of the present study,
