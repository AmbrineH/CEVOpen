<p class="p">The antifungal mechanism of CMEO was evidenced by estimating the content of intracellular ROS in CMEO treated (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) and untreated control samples using DCFH-DA adopting a technique of 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al. (2010)</xref> with minor modification. A different concentration of CMEO (up to MFC value) was mixed with 10 μL spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> spores per mL) in 96-well microtiter plate and total volume brought up to 100 μL with CD broth and incubated for 7 days at 28°C. The sample not treated with CMEO was considered as a control. Subsequently, samples were stained for 20 min with 5 μM DCFH-DA. The fluorescence intensity was determined at excitation of 495 nm and emission of 550 nm in a multimode reader (Biotek-H1M synergy, Germany) and percentage of intracellular ROS in CMEO-treated samples was determined with respect to the untreated control (100%). The phase-contrast and fluorescent images were captured under an EVOS fluorescence microscope (Life Technologies, United States) at a magnification of 200 μm.
