<p class="p">Antifungal activity of CMEO was tested on mycotoxigenic 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> (DFRL FgM: 18), which was originally isolated from freshly harvested maize kernels in our earlier study (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mudili et al., 2014</xref>). The fungal culture was allowed to grow for 14 days at 28Â°C on CD agar and spores were collected in sterile peptone water made up of 0.05% of Tween 80 by soft scrap, and the sum of spores was attained to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> spores/mL using a hemocytometer and used in further studies. The antifungal activity of CMEO was determined by the micro-well dilution method. Furthermore, deleterious effects of CMEO on micromorphology of macroconidia were observed by SEM. The mechanism of antifungal activity of CMEO was unveiled by comparing the content of intracellular ROS, lipid peroxidation, and ergosterol content of CMEO-treated fungi with untreated control fungi.
