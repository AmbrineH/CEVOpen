<p class="p">The impact of CMEO on ergosterol content of 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> was determined following the methodology of 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Silva et al. (2010)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sellamani et al. (2016)</xref> with minor modifications. Different concentrations of CMEO (up to MFC value of 618.3 ppm) were exposed to 10 μL spore suspension (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> spores per mL) in 100 mL CD broth of 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated for a period of 7 days at 28°C. Subsequently, the mycelia were separated from the broth employing Whatman no. 1 filter paper. A quantity of 5 mg of mycelia was used for determination of ergosterol and blended with 1 mL of ethanol, 5 mL of methanol, and 0.5 g of potassium hydroxide. The mixture was kept in dark at 70°C for 40 min and supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and thoroughly mixed for 10 min with n-hexane (v/v, 1:1). The blend was dried out at 60°C using water bath and re-solubilized in 1 mL of methanol and quantification of ergosterol was deducted from the calibration curve of standard ergosterol and results were compared with CMEO untreated control. A calibration curve for standard ergosterol was constructed with peak area vs. concentration of ergosterol using HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The system was equipped with C18 column, 5 μm thickness, 250 mm × 4.60 mm (Phenomenex, CA, United States) and working conditions were as follows: stock solution of ergosterol was prepared in methanol, injecting volume was 25 μL for both test and standard samples, UV detector was used with an excitation of 240 nm and emission of 300 nm wavelengths, and mobile phase was acetonitrile and water in a ratio of 6.5:3.5 (v/v) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
