<p class="p">In the present study, CMEO was extracted from leaves by hydrodistillation technique and chemical profile was determined by GC-MS analysis. The antifungal activity of CMEO on 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> was determined in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) by micro-well dilution method, and further, it was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation of macroconidia. The antifungal mechanism of CMEO was revealed by determining the content of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and ergosterol. The chitosan encapsulated CMEO nanoparticles (Ce-CMEO-NPs) were prepared by emulsification technique and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), SEM, Zeta potential and size, and 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> release of essential oil. Finally, 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antifungal and antimycotoxin activities of CMEO and Ce-CMEO-NPs on 
 <italic class="italic">F. graminearum</italic> were comparatively evaluated in maize grains.
