<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of the thermo‐treated EOs was determined by the following method. Cold pressed EO and light phase EO were treated with heat at 60°C, 80°C, 100°C, and 121°C for 20 min, respectively. Then, paper disks (6 mm) were impregnated with 5 μl of heat‐treated EOs and the antimicrobial activity was determined according to the method previously described. The untreated EO stored at 25°C was used as the positive control. Sterile water alone was used as the negative control.</p>
