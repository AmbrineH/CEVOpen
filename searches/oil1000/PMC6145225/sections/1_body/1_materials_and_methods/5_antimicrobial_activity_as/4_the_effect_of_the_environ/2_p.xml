<p class="p">The effect of environmental acidity and alkalinity on the antimicrobial activity of EO was investigated according to the following method. The agar mediums were adjusted to pH value of 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 with 2% NaOH solution and 50% citric acid solution, and the mixtures were autoclaved at 115°C for 30 min. Cooled autoclaved agar was distributed evenly in Petri dishes aseptically. The antimicrobial activity of both EOs was determined using the agar disk diffusion method (Xin, Liu, Zhang, &amp; Gao, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Paper disks (6 mm) were impregnated with 5 μl of cold pressed EO and light phase EO and then placed on the inoculated Petri dishes containing tested microorganisms (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/ml). The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr, except for

Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zones to the nearest millimeter (mm). Sterile water alone was used as the control.
