<p class="p">MIC values of Gannan navel orange cold pressed EO, light phase EO, and seven individual constituents against microorganisms were determined by the tube dilution method (Burt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Rota, Carraminana, Burillo, &amp; Herrera, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Serial dilutions of EOs and individual constituents were prepared with liquid nutrient media containing 5 ml of LB or YEPD medium. Each tube was inoculated with 0.5 ml of a standardized suspension of microbial test species containing 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/ml, then incubated at 37°C for 24 hr, except for 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic>, which was incubated at 25°C for 48 hr. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of EOs and individual constituents at which microorganisms failed to grow, so no visible changes were detected in the broth medium. All determinations were performed in triplicates.
