<p class="p">The following microorganisms were purchased from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC): 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC25922), 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC25923), 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC6633), 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (ATCC204412). The first three microbial strains were maintained in Luria‐Bertani medium at 37°C, and the 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> was maintained in Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YEPD) medium at 25°C. Subsequently, one colony from each culture was inoculated in liquid medium for 18–24 hr with shaking (200 rpm) to obtain freshly cultured microbial suspensions (&gt;10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml) for test.
