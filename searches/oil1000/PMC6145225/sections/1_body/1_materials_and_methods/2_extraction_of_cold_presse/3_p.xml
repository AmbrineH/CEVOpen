<p class="p">Light phase EO was obtained by molecular distillation from cold pressed EO using a wiped‐film molecular distillation apparatus (Pope Two Inch Laboratory Scale Wiped‐Film Molecular Still &amp; Evaporator; Pope Scientific Inc., Saukville, WI, USA). The evaporation temperature and operation pressure were 50°C and 10.0 Torr, respectively. Orange oil was fed at room temperature, and the feeding rate was 3.0 ml/min. The rotational speed of the roller wiper was 350 rpm, and the condenser temperature was 0°C.</p>
