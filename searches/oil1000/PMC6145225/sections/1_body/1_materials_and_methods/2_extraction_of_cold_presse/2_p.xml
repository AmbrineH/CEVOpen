<p class="p">Cold pressed EO was obtained by physical extraction from the peel of Gannan navel orange (

 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The recovery of orange oil by FOMESA extractor (Model 391, Food Machinery Espanola, S.A., Valencia, Spain) was carried out during simultaneous extraction of juice and oil. The oil cells were ruptured by pressure, and the oil was washed away with water. The oil emulsion passed through a 20‐mesh shaker screen to remove most of the insolubles. Then a three‐stage centrifuge system was used to separate orange oil efficiently. The first stage removed some water and insoluble solids by three‐phase disk stack centrifugal separator to produce an emulsion with around 40% oil content. This emulsion was fed to the second stage centrifuge, where the oil content was concentrated to around 88%. The third stage removed the remaining water and cloudy particles to achieve complete separation of the oil phase.
