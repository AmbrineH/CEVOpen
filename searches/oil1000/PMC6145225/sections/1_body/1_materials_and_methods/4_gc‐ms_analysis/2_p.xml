<p class="p">Gannan navel orange EO components were identified and quantified using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent mass spectrometer detector. The GC‐MS system was equipped with a DB‐5 MS capillary column (30.00 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV with a spectra range of 50 to 500 m/z. The injector and detector temperatures were operated at 150°C and 250°C, respectively. The oven temperature was maintained at 80°C for 4 min and subsequently raised to 250°C (5°C/min) for 10 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, at a split ratio of 100:1. Most of the components were identified by comparing their mass spectra with those of the computer mass libraries of The National Institute of Standards and Technology (2010).</p>
