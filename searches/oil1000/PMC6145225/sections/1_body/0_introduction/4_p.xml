<p class="p">In commercial practice, large‐scale orange EO is mainly prepared by cold pressing method (Leão, Sampaio, Pagani, &amp; Silva, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Cold pressed orange EO was extracted by mechanical rupturing of the oil sacs in the flavedo, expressing the oil as an aqueous emulsion from which it is separated by centrifuging. It consists of terpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and acids along with some nonvolatile waxy materials, carotenoids, flavonoids, etc. However, pigment, wax, and pesticide residue in EO are disadvantageous to be used as antimicrobial agents in food. Molecular distillation is an efficient method to separate some undesired molecules without harming the natural (desirable) properties of EO (Borgarello, Mezza, Pramparo, &amp; Gayol, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Separation can be achieved based on the difference of the mean free path of different molecules. This method is characterized by a high vacuum operation that causes a decrease in the boiling point of substances (Rossi, Pramparo Mdel, Gaich, Grosso, &amp; Nepote, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Therefore, molecular distillation is very useful to separate thermal sensitive EOs and extensively used in flavor and fragrance industry.
