<p class="p">The composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EO varies markedly according to variety, seasonality, geographic origin, ripeness of the fruit, extraction method, and also an interaction of various factors (Fisher &amp; Phillips, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Usually, it is made up of a complex mixture of volatile (85%–99%) components (Moufida &amp; Marzouk, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and their oxygenated derivatives (Raut &amp; Karuppayil, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Verzera, Trozzi, Gazea, Cicciarello, &amp; Cotroneo, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Limonene is the major chemical component of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EO, ranging from 32 to 98% of the total oil (Moufida &amp; Marzouk, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). The antimicrobial activity of EO is directly correlated to the presence of its bioactive volatile constituents, although it may be varied with environmental conditions (Bakkali et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Perczak et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The well‐known and characterized constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EO include limonene, linalool, and citral, which have been proved to exert potent, broad‐spectrum antimicrobial capacity (Bezic, Skocibusic, &amp; Dunkic, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). As 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs are generally recognized as safe (GRAS), they have been screened for antimicrobial properties against common food‐borne pathogens (Bakkali et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Burt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In addition, they have been used as natural food preservatives and accepted by consumers all over the world (Sharma et al.,
