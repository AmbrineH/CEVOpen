<p class="p">Molecular distillation of cold pressed Gannan navel orange EO provided light phase EO, and the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of both EOs were studied. Both EOs showed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram‐positive, Gram‐negative microorganisms, and yeast, with MIC values ranging from 0.39 to 3.13 μl/ml. Light phase EO had better antimicrobial activity than cold pressed EO. Oxygenated compounds might be important constituents to inhibit microorganisms. Light phase EO exhibited the best antibacterial activity under weak acidic and neutral conditions with a good thermal stability might be used as a novel antimicrobial agent in food industry.</p>
