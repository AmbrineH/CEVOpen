<p class="p">Cold pressed EO and light phase EO showed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro (Table

 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>) studied, light phase EO (MIC = 0.78 μl/ml) showed better antimicrobial activity than that of cold pressed EO (MIC = 1.56 μl/ml). On the other hand, regarding the Gram‐positive bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>) tested, the bacteriostatic activity was weaker (MIC = 1.56–3.13 μl/ml), which may be due to the differing structures of their respective cell walls (Seow, Yeo, Chung, &amp; Yuk, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Regarding the eukaryotic microorganism (
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic>) tested, light phase EO showed higher antimicrobial activity (MIC = 0.39 μl/ml) than that of cold pressed EO (MIC = 1.56 μl/ml). Light phase EO showed more sensitivity to tested microorganisms under treatment conditions, and the low MICs (0.039–0.313% v/v) were suitable to food application. These results demonstrated that molecular distillation technology can provide EO fraction with better antimicrobial activity.
