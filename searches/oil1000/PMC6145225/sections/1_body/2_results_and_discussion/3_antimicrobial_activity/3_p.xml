<p class="p">Seven individual constituents were selected to test their antimicrobial activity (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Citral, nonanal, decanal, linalool, and terpineol had higher antagonistic activity (MIC = 0.20–1.98 μl/ml) against 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> B. subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> than Limonene and α‐pinene (MIC = 1.96–15.38 μl/ml). However, all tested individual constituents showed lower sensitivity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with MIC ranging from 3.92 to 15.84 μl/ml. Generally, the tested aldehydes and alcohols had better antimicrobial activities than monoterpene hydrocarbons. These results were consistent with the previous studies that some oxygenated compounds presented a higher antimicrobial activity than nonoxygenated hydrocarbons (Burt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Fisher et al. (Fisher &amp; Phillips, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) demonstrated that linalool and citral in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs had antimicrobial effects against 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter jejuni</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> O157, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> B. cereus,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Moreover, some researchers have shown that carvone and limonene oxide were active against a wide spectrum of pathogenic fungi and bacteria (Aggarwal et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Mustafa, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We noticed that Gannan navel orange light phase EO had higher content of carvone and limonene oxide than cold pressed EO which might due to oxidation during distillation. Higher activity of light phase EO might be attributable to its higher proportion of oxygenated compounds. Meanwhile, antimicrobial activity of both EOs might also be due to the synergistic, additive, and antagonistic interaction of their constituents (Burt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). The investigation of the individual constituents in EO can provide useful information to fit different products or purposes with simultaneous elevation of their antimicrobial activities.
