<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of cold pressed EO and light phase EO was closely related to pH value of the medium (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The antibacterial activity was significantly different with increasing pH values. Cold pressed EO showed highest antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> at pH 7.0. Light phase EO showed strongest antibacterial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> at pH 5.0, against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> at pH 7.0. Then, the inhibitory activity obviously decreased with the increase of alkalinity in the environment condition. These results suggested that Gannan navel orange EO showed best antimicrobial under pH value ranged from 5.0 to 7.0, which were consistent with previous studies that 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> EOs showed high antimicrobial activity under the partial acidic condition (Bakkali et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). It was probable that under acidic condition, active constituents dissolved better in the lipid phase of the bacterial membrane, and their binding abilities with membrane protein enhanced, leading to a higher antimicrobial activity (Burt, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Durairaj, Srinivasan, &amp; Lakshmanaperumalsamy, 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In contrast, under alkaline condition, certain chemical reaction such as aldol condensation would occur among active oxygenated constituents especially aldehydes in EO, leading to a lower inhibitory activity.
