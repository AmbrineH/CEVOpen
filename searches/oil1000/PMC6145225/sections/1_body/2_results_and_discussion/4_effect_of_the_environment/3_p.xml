<p class="p">The activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> showed no significant difference when EOs were heat‐treated at 60–100°C for 20 min, except that the activity against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> reduced nearly threefold after treatment at 100°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). When light phase EO was treated at 121°C for 20 min, its activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> was not obviously different except that its activity against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> reduced nearly threefold. These results demonstrated Gannan navel orange EO have good thermal stability, especially for light phase EO at high temperatures. Thus, light phase EO was beneficial to use as antimicrobial agents for high‐temperature food processing.
