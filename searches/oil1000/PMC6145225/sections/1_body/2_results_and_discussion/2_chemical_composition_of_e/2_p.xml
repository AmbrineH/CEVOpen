<p class="p">The chemical components of Gannan navel orange cold pressed EO and light phase EO were analyzed by GC‐MS (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3688-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> different chemical constituents, accounting for 98.73%, were identified in cold pressed EO. Similarly, 20 different chemical constituents, accounting for 93.17%, were identified in light phase EO which was obtained by molecular distillation from cold pressed EO. Limonene was the major constituent, accounting for 85.32% of cold pressed EO and 60.44% of light phase EO, consistent with previous studies that limonene was the main constituent of

 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)‐carveol (2.00%), 
 <italic class="italic">tranns‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol (1.15%), and (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)‐carveol (1.10%) contributed significantly to light phase EO final composition. For cold pressed EO, besides limonene, only β‐myrcene (5.11%), α‐pinene (1.95%), sabinene (1.12%), and linalool (1.29%) were present in amounts higher than 1%. Light phase EO has a higher content of oxygenated substances (17.28%) than cold pressed EO (4.25%).
