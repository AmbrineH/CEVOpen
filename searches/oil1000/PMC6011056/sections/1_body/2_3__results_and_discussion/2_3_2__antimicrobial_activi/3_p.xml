<p class="p">In a study by [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], it was shown that the essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> C. cassia</italic> was 85.06% (E)-cinnamaldehyde. In addition, antimicrobial activity was found against strains of
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa, E. coli,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>. The results demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect in which the MICs of (E)-cinnamaldehyde and
 <italic class="italic"> C. cassia </italic>oil were 0.3 mg/ml for Gram-negative strains and that of (E)-cinnamaldehyde was 0.25 mg/ml for
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>, with the essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> C. cassia</italic> having an MIC of 0.6 mg/ml against
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>.
