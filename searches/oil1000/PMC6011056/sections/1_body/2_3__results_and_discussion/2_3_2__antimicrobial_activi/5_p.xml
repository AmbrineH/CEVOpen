<p class="p">A study by [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] demonstrated the antibacterial activity of cinnamaldehyde against
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic>. In this study, cinnamaldehyde presented MIC values of 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/m and MBC value of 0.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for both bacteria, similar to the data obtained in this study. In addition, scanning electron microscopy showed morphological changes, which were confirmed by the increase of nucleic acid and protein levels in the cell suspension, indicating that the cell membrane was damaged. Thus, according to the authors, cinnamaldehyde plays a role in disrupting the bacterial cell membrane.
