 <italic class="italic">Trypticase Soy Agar</italic>-Difco®) and grown in a greenhouse at 37°C for 24 h. After this initial growth, a 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l inoculum was subcultured into 10 ml of TSB (
 <italic class="italic">Trypticase Soy Broth</italic>- Difco®) and grown for 18 h under the same conditions described above. In the antimicrobial activity assays, the cultures were washed with Mili-Rios water and their concentrations were adjusted to 10
