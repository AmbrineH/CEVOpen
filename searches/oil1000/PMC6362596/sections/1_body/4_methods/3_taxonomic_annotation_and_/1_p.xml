<p id="Par39" class="p">To evaluate the classification task, the genetic permutation combination NR database using diamond was utilized (version 0.8.24.86 with default parameter values, except ≤1e-5) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. As previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>], for each gene, a major reserved game (which is defined by the 10 × e value of the energy value ≤ the most popular definition) was used to distinguish between taxa. The level of classification of each gene was determined in Megan and implemented with the lowest common ancestral algorithm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. The abundance of a taxonomic group was calculated via the sum of genes of a feature of the annotation.
