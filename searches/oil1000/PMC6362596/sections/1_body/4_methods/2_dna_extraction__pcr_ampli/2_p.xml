 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. For each sample, a series of k-mer = 39 (parameters: -d 1, −R, −u) was used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. The assembled scaffolds are disrupted from the N junction, resulting in an N-free sequence fragment. Clean data of each quality control was compared with Soap Aligner software to assembled Scaftigs of each sample to obtain unused PE reads (parameters: -u, − 2, −m 200) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. The best samples with the longest N50 of the rest of the stent were selected. Unused readings for each sample were assembled using the same parameters. The MetaGeneMark predictor gene was used for shafting of more than 500 bp (prokaryotic GeneMark.hmm version 2.10). Then, a non-redundant gene catalog constructed CD-HIT (parameter: - 0 - 0.9 - 1 - 0 - G D C 0.9) using the 0.9 sequence with the lowest cutoff for the shorter sequence coverage 0.9 cutoff [
