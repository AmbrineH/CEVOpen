<p id="Par36" class="p">Microbial DNA was extracted from rumen fluid samples using the TIANGEN kit (TIANGEN Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (with an insert size of 300 bp and a read length of 125 bp) at the Bioinformatics GmbH (Novogene), after quality control and read-alignment to the goat genome. The remaining high quality reads were used for further analysis [
