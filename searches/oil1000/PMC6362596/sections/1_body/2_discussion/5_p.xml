<p id="Par33" class="p">The proteobacterial load has been suggested as a potential diagnostic criterion for dysbiosis and disease, and its ratio belongs to the Proteobacteria / (Bacteroides + Firmicutes) ≥ 0.19 and has been used as a marker of whether the GI microbiology community is imbalanced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Here, the metagenomic sequencing results is summarized and the ratio of Proteobacteria / (Bacteroides + Firmicutes) was below 0.19 in the EOC diet groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d); therefore, the addition of EOC did not cause dysbiosis of the goat ruminal microbiology. Via correlation analysis, we found that 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Succinivibrio</italic> sp. follow a positive correlation with the production of VFA. According to previous studies, we found that an environment favoring large numbers of 
 <italic class="italic">Succinivibrio</italic> sp. would not only contribute to substrate oxidations and reductions, but closely coupled to this, with little methane being formed, it would also ensure that more digestible energy is available for the host animal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Addition of EOC significantly increased the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Succinivibrio</italic> sp. The increased abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Succinivibrio</italic> sp. encourages more carbohydrates to be broken down into VFAs for the body’s energy and for improved feed utilization.
