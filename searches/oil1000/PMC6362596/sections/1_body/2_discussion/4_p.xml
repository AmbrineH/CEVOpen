<p id="Par32" class="p">Hyper-Ammonia-Producing (HAP) bacteria are the most sensitive rumen bacteria in pure culture and can produce NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> from amino acids. Several steps have been reported to be involved in the catabolism of all proteins involved in 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> sp. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that EO inhibits the growth of certain HAP bacteria (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium sticklandii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Peptostreptococcus anaerobius</italic>), while other HAP bacteria (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium aminophilum</italic>) are not sensitive. Low numbers of HAP bacteria have been reported for the rumen (1% rumen bacterial population); however, they have high deamination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. Our study showed that addition of EO largely affected the proportion of low abundance bacteria in the rumen. The bacteria associated with NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N production were significantly different between the 52 mg and control groups. Moreover, the phenotype data suggested that the addition of EO increases the production of acetate and butyrate. This contributed to the increase of the total volatile acid production. Another study of in vitro ruminal microbial fermentation suggested that EO exhibited antimicrobial activities mainly by reducing fermentation and by shifting the VFA pattern towards less propionate and more butyrate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. In general, the most fundamental role of VFA in ruminants is to provide energy and the main role of ruminal microorganisms is to decompose nutrients into VFA and ammonia, and then use this for re-biosynthesis or for the energy metabolism. Acetate is absorbed by the ruminal wall, and most of the unmodified acetate enters the portal blood, is transported to the liver, and subsequently to peripheral tissues, where it is used for oxidation by tricarboxylic acid for cellular energy or fatty acid synthesis. Three-carbon propionate is the main precursor of gluconeogenesis and as a 3-carbon compound, it is considered a glucose former (six carbons). Butyrate (most of the conversion to β-hydroxyl butyrate) is exposed to several types of body tissues in the rumen, such as the reticulum wall that support the absorption process and is an especially important muscle energy source. In addition, previous studies reported that addition of EO reduced the methane production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. EO can either directly inhibit methanogenic archaea or indirectly decrease methane production via direct depression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. EOs may cause changes in the archaeal community structure or in the activity of the methanogenesis pathway, thus subsequently decreasing methanogen abundance and methane production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Our study found that EOC did not significantly affect the abundance of methanogenic bacteria.
