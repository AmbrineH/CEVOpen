<p id="Par31" class="p">In addition, members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>, an acidophilic bacterium, increased their population in response to EOC addition; at present, there is no clear conclusion about the ecological function of 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>. Only few strains can be cultivated independently; therefore, we can only summarize and speculate based on the existing research. Environmental factors significantly affected the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>, the most influential of which is the pH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Previous isolation and culture studies showed that the 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic> strains KBS83 and KBS96 have cellulolytic ability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Studies have also shown that 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic> accounts for more than 50% of the soil microbial community. For example, the microbial community of soil samples around chestnut tree roots consisted of as much as 65% 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic> are widely distributed in the natural environment and even in extreme environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>], such as polluted environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>] and waste-water environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]; therefore, it has been speculated that 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic> exerts a driver role in different ecosystem.
