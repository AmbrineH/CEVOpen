<p id="Par26" class="p">Of the 17 identified phyla, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic> were predominant in goat rumen samples (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2). However, with increased EOC dose, an increase in the number of 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> was found, while an increase in the number of 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Synergistetes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Elusimicrobia</italic> was also found. Compared to the 0 mg group and 52 mg group, decreases in 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicute</italic>s were observed in the rumen samples. Compared to the 52 mg group and 91 mg group, significant decreases in 
 <italic class="italic">Tenericutes</italic> were observed in the rumen samples (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). At the genus level, most of the annotated genes belonged to 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic>, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alistipes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Treponema</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcus</italic> in the 0 mg supplement group (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S3). Compared to the 0 mg group and 52 mg group, significant changes in 
 <italic class="italic">Succinimonas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Brachyspira</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> were found (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Compared to the 52 mg group and 91 mg group, 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> significantly decreased in the ruminal samples (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.009) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). The microbiome abundance of metagenomics in the genus obtained via principal component analysis (PCA) of each group using the Bray–Curtis similarity metric showed that the bacterial populations in each sample were best clustered together according to the differences in EOC content in the diet. These three groups showed distinct separation and the spatial location of 0 mg and 52 mg groups was dissimilar, indicating that the microbiota structure was different in both groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). These results suggest that the increase of EOC dosage has a stronger impact on the goat rumen microbiota, especially on the lower abundance of bacteria (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). Our results suggested that the addition of EOC did not significantly affect the abundance of methanogenic bacteria in the rumen (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S4).
