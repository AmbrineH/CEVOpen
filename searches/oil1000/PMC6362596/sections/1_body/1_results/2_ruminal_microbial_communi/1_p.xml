 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N values were associated with the variation of rumen microbiota that may result from the addition of EOC, we conducted metagenomic analyses using rumen fluid samples from different EOC treatment groups. Deep sequencing of rumen fluid DNA samples generated 107 Gb of high-quality data with an average of 11.84 Gb per sample (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1), enabling identification of 699,497 non-redundant (NR) genes with an average N50 contig length of 2.83 Kb. The EOC enriched diet group had lower gene counts than controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a) and the 52 mg EOC group had lower bacterial diversity than controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b), indicating that gene richness was lower in the EOC diet group. We observed higher β diversity in the 52 mg EOC diet group, when the supplementary of EOC reached 91 mg, we observed lower β diversity than controls, indicating the dose of EOC significantly influences the community structure in rumen (Fig.
