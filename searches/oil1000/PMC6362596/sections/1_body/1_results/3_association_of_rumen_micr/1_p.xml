<p id="Par27" class="p">To determine the correlation between metabolites and changes of rumen microbiome in different groups, we conducted association analyses (Pearson’s rank correlation coefficients) of the phenotypic module to detect significantly different microbiome. Furthermore, pH, NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N, daily weight, acetic acid, total acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid correlated with alterations in the rumen microbiota. The authors found that 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfosporosinus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> sp. were positively correlated with the production of NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N and were negatively correlated with the production of VFA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). In addition, we also conducted a difference analysis on the above genus and found a significant difference between the EOC diet group and the control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). We furthermore found that 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Succinivibrio</italic> sp. were positively correlated with VFA production and negatively correlated with NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). The abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Succinivibrio</italic> sp. were significantly lower compared to the 0 mg group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c), indicating that these species may constitute potential linking ruminal microbiota and metabolic status.
