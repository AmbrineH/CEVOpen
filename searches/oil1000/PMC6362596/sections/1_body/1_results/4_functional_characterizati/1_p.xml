 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>] was used to identify differentially abundant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in metagenome datasets. We identified 2130 KEGG Orthology (KOs) present in nine samples, of which 246 KOs differed in both the 0 mg group and 52 mg group (FDR &lt; 0.05; Additional file

The most highly expressed genes in the 52 mg group were associated with calcium-dependent protein kinase (K13412), Ras-related protein Rab-11A (K07904), Ras-related protein Rab-22 (K07891), serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1 catalytic subunit (K06269), and serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK/ATG1 (K08269; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). In summary, these results demonstrate that the microbiota of the EOC diet group may have a higher capacity for nitrogen utilization and a higher capacity for xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism.
