<p id="Par24" class="p">The villus height and width parameters were used to determine the effect of EOC supplementation on ruminal morphology. The villus height in the 0 mg group significantly enhanced its growth in the dorsal rumen (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>i), suggesting that an EOC enriched diet tended to stimulate ruminal villus development. Moreover, H&amp;E staining was used to examine the ruminal morphology and the results showed that an EOC enriched diet significantly improved the function of ruminal nutrient digestion and subsequent absorption (Fig.
