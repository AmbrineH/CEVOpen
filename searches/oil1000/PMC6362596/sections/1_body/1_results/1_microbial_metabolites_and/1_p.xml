<p id="Par23" class="p">In the present study, slaughter components such as meat quality, carcass weight, dressing percentage, net meat percentage, meat-bone ratio, and perineal fat were found to be significantly different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) when comparing the 91 mg group mean value with the control group. The cooked meat percentage was significantly (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) affected by EOC treatment (Lei et al. 2018). In the present study, all goats had a similar dry matter intake (DMI; see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>); however, the average daily gain (ADG) was affected by the feed additive levels. The ADG were significant increased with diet addition EOC (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). In addition, the 52 mg group showed a significant lower pH than other groups (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b), suggesting that feed additive levels significantly affect the ruminal pH. It is worth mentioning that the addition of EOC can significantly reduce the production of ammonia (NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-N) in the rumen (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c). Ruminal proportions of total acid and acetate were markedly elevated when goats consumed 52 mg EOC (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>d &amp; e). Acetate is mostly absorbed through the ruminal wall, transported unmodified into the blood, then transported to the liver, and moved via the portal blood to peripheral tissues for oxidation via tricarboxylic acid to gain energy or for fatty acid synthesis. Propionate and butyrate also showed a similar increasing trend; however, this difference was not significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>f &amp; g). In summary, the volatile fatty acid (VFA) content is one of the main indicators for ruminal fermentation, while the main impact of fundamental factors is the structure of the diet. These results indicate that adding 52 mg EOC changed in ruminal fermentation types.
