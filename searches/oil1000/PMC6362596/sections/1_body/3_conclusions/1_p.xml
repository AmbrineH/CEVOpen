<p id="Par34" class="p">In summary, the metagenome data that was analyzed in this study provides strong evidence that a 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Succinivibrio</italic> sp. type bacterial community was associated with the production of VFA as a result of EOC supplementation to the feed diet. A clear pattern was found, reflecting rapid fermentative growth in the rumen subsequent metabolism to butyrate. EOs may act as promising natural substances to mitigate ruminal methane and ammonia production, improve rumen fermentations, and thus, reduce the environmental impact of ruminant production.
