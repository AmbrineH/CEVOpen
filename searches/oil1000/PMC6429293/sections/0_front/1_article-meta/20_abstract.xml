 <p class="p">The focus of present study is on 
  <italic class="italic">Codium bursa</italic> collected from the Adriatic Sea. 
  <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> volatiles were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-FID; GC-MS) after headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), hydrodistillation (HD), and supercritical CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction (SC-CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>). The headspace composition of dried (HS-D) and fresh (HS-F) 
  <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> was remarkably different. Dimethyl sulfide, the major HS-F compound was present in HS-D only as a minor constituent and heptadecane percentage was raised in HS-D. The distillate of fresh 
  <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> contained heptadecane and docosane among the major compounds. After air-drying, a significantly different composition of the volatile oil was obtained with (
  <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-phytol as the predominant compound. It was also found in SC-CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract of freeze-dried 
  <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> (FD-CB) as the major constituent. Loliolide (3.51%) was only identified in SC-CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract. Fatty acids were determined from FD-CB after derivatisation as methyl esters by GC-FID. The most dominant acids were palmitic (25.4%), oleic (36.5%), linoleic (11.6%), and stearic (9.0%). FD-CB H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extract exhibited better antifungal effects against 
  <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp., while dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) extract was better for the inhibition of 
  <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum, Aspergillus flavus</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Rhizophus</italic> spp. The extracts showed relatively good antifungal activity, especially against 
  <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic> (for DMSO extract MIC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> was at 50 Âµg/mL).
