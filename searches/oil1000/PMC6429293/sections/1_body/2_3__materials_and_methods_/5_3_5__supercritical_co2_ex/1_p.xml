<p class="p">SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction was performed in a supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) system explained in detail previously [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The grounded freeze-dried sample of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> L. (30 g; FD-CB) was placed into the extractor vessel and the extraction was performed 90 min at temperature of 40 °C and pressure of 300 bar. Dynamic extraction mode for SFE was used where SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> continuously passed through the sample matrix. The obtained extract was diluted with hexane and diethyl ether (1:2
