    <italic class="italic">C. Bursa</italic> (500 g) was washed five times in water and twice in deionized water. For the freeze-drying experiment the samples were cut in slices (from 5 to 10 mm) and frozen at −60 °C for 24 h in an ultra-low freezer. Five trays of frozen samples were placed in a laboratory freeze dryer (CoolSafe PRO, Labogene, Denmark). The freeze drying process was performed for 24 h under high vacuum (0.13–0.55 hPa) with primary and secondary drying temperatures of −30 °C and 20 °C, respectively. Freeze-dried samples (
