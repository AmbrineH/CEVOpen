<p class="p">The headspace extraction was performed by manual SPME holder equipped with polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) fiber and divinylbenzene/carboxene/ polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber obtained from Supelco Co. (Bellefonte, PA, USA). Each fibre was conditioned before the extraction (according to Supelco Co. instructions). For HS-SPME, previously prepared samples of fresh (1 g; F-CB) and dried 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> (0.7 g; D-CB) were placed separately in 5 mL glass vials and hermetically sealed with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)/silicone septa. The vials were maintained in a water bath at 60 °C during the equilibration (15 min) and extraction (45 min). After sampling, the SPME fiber was withdrawn into the needle, removed from the vial, and inserted into the injector (250 °C) of the GC-FID and GC-MS for 6 min. The extracted volatiles were thermally desorbed directly to the GC column. HS-SPME of F-CB was performed within 24 h after the collection. HS-SPME was done in duplicate.
