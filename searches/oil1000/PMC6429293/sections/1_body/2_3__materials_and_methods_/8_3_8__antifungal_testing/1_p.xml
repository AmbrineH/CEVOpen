<p class="p">Antifungal testing was performed in accordance with the guidelines (document M38-A) [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] with modifications described by Šarkanj et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In this study the most important mycotoxin-producing species [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] were chosen as tested fungi. 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic> (NRRL 3251)
 <italic class="italic">, Aspergillus ochraceus</italic> (CBS 589.68)
 <italic class="italic">, Fusarium graminearum</italic> (CBS 110.250)
 <italic class="italic">, Fusarium verticillioides</italic> (119.825)
 <italic class="italic"/>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum</italic> (CBS 164.59) were used as producers of regulated mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, fumonisins, zearalenon, patulin, and citrinin). In addition, several species that are important producers of emerging mycotoxins were also used, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria alternata</italic> (wild type) and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophus</italic> spp. (wild type). For the inoculum preparation, the fungal spores were harvested from 7 days old potato dextrose agar (PDA) slants grown at 25 °C in the dark (except for 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp. where the mung bean agar (MBA) was used instead of PDA as a better alternative for sporulation). The number of the spores for inoculation was adjusted to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL by using Haemocytometer. For the antifungal susceptibility testing the RPMI 1640 medium buffered with 0.164 M MOPS (3-(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) at pH 7.0 was sterilized by filtration through 0.22 µm filter.
