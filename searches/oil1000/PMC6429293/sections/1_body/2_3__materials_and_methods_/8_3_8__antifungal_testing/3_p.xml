<p class="p">During the experiment growth, increasement was also noted in some cases compared to control and, therefore, growth inducing concentration (GIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) for at least 50% of the cells was defined as the tested extract concentration where optical density was at least 50% higher at 405 nm compared to growth control.
