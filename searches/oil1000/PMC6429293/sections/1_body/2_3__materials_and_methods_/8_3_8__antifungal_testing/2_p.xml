<p class="p">The ground, freeze-dried sample of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> L. (1 g; FD-CB) was used for ultrasound-assisted extraction with water (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent using an ultrasound bath with temperature control at 37 kHz and the ultrasonic power of 50 W (Elma, Elmasonic P 70 H, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Gottlieb–Daimler, Singen, Germany). The obtained extracts (500 mg/10 mL) were sterilized by filtration and diluted to tested concentrations (5000, 500, 50, and 5 µg/mL) in sterile buffered RPMI 1640 media. The plates were incubated at 35 °C in the dark during 72 h (to ensure stable growth of all tested fungi). After growth, the plates were read on a microplate reader (Azure Ao Absorbance microplate reader, Azure biosystems, Dublin CA, USA) at 405 nm. The Minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% cells (MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was defined as the lowest concentration reducing the optical density by 50% at 405 nm compared to growth control.
