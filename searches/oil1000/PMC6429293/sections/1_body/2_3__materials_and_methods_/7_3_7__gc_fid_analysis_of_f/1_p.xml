 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Gas chromatograph 7890A (Agilent Technologies, Lake Forest, CA, USA) with a capillary column ZB-WAX 25 m long with a diameter of 0.25 mm and the thickness of the stationary phase 0.25 microns (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), a split–splitless injector (temperature 260 °C) and a flame ionization detector (temperature 280 °C) was used. A sample (5 µL) was injected with a split ratio of 1:40. Start column temperature was 60 °C with holding time for 2 min. The oven temperature was increased at the rate of 13 °C/min to 150 °C, then at the rate of 2 °C/min was heated to 240 °C. The carrier gas was helium (99.9999%) at a constant flow rate of 3 mL/min. The hydrogen flow was 70 mL/min, air flow was 450 mL/min, and the makeup gas flow (nitrogen) was 15 mL/min. Fatty acid methyl esters were identified by comparison with retention times of 37 fatty acid methyl ester standard compounds analyzed at the same conditions. The result is expressed as a percentage (%) of individual fatty acids to total fatty acids. The detection limit of the method was 0.1%.
