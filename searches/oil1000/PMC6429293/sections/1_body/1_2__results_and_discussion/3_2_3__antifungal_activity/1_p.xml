<p class="p">The experiment aimed to gain insight into the antifungal activity of two extracts of FD-CB, not to investigate the extracts chemical composition or to identify the compounds responsible for the noted activity. Two solvents of different polarity (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) were used for the extraction of FD-CB. The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined against the most common and problematic fungal species with regard to regulated and emerging mycotoxin production. The obtained results are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00842-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The extracts exhibited a relatively low antifungal effect to most common cereals associated mycotoxigenic fungi (
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria alternata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus ochraceus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium graminearum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium verticillioides</italic>), and relatively good antifungal effect (MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> at 50 µg/mL DMSO extract) to fruit associated storage fungi 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium expansum</italic>. When comparing both extracts, there is a significant difference in the antifungal effect suggesting that different components or their concentrations were extracted by two solvents. 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp. was more susceptible to high concentrations of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extracts, while 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophus</italic> spp. were more susceptible to DMSO extracts, although detected MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> concentrations were several orders of magnitude higher compared with the reference standards (
 <italic class="italic">Amphotericin B</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Itraconazole</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Posaconazole</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Voriconazole</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. On the other hand, increased growth of several fungal species was also noted, and, therefore, a new parameter was added—growth-inducing concentration (GIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>). The new parameter also showed at which concentrations the tested extracts induce the growth (based on the optical density at 405 nm) for at least 50% compared with the control. Based on these calculations some of tested extracts on several fungal species did not show inhibitory properties but rather growth inducing properties, while for other fungal strains there was concentration dependent change from MIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> to GIC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>. Interestingly, DMSO extract showed the antifungal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophus</italic> spp. at 5000 µg/mL while H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extract at the same concentration showed growth inducing properties. A similar trend was observed for 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic> where DMSO extract showed excellent antifungal properties, and on the other hand, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extract exhibited great growth-inducing potential. Both extracts did not show growth-inducing effect against 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp. 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> was only fungi that exhibited susceptibility towards H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extract, and growth-inducing effect towards DMSO extract that was noticeable only when high concentrations were used (5000 µg/mL). 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> showed great concentration-dependent response to the usage of FD-CB extracts. While the high amount of DMSO extract exhibited antifungal properties (5000 µg/mL), at low concentrations (5 and 50 µg/mL) DMSO extract showed growth inducing properties. Similarly, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extract at 5 µg/mL increased the growth of the fungi indicating possible hormetic effect. Further characterization of the active compounds in the extracts is in progress.
