<p class="p">The chemical composition of the headspace of dried 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> (HS-D) was remarkably different. Namely, the major HS-F headspace compound, DMS, was present in the dried sample only as a minor constituent (3.72%; 3.10%) and its percentage fall of was ca. 15.3 and 11.7 times, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00842-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). That could be the consequence of its low molecular mass and high volatility. However, another DMSP breakdown product, dimethylsulfoxide (1.52%; 2.63%), appeared only in HS-D. On the other hand, the percentage of heptadecane raised in HS-D up to 52.62% (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00842-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) presumably as the consequence of DMS loss. In addition, several other saturated hydrocarbons appeared in HS-D (
