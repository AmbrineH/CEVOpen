<p class="p">After air-drying 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa, a</italic> significantly different chemical composition of the volatile oil was obtained (HD-D). Namely, (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-phytol predominated (58.42%), and its percentage raised ca. 17.7 times in comparison to HD-F, probably as the consequence of chlorophyll breakdown [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In addition, the percentage of phytone raised ca. 3.5 times compared to the fresh sample. Oxidation of phytol moiety of chlorophyll could lead, among others, to the methylated long chain fatty acid ketone-hexahydroxyfarnesyl acetone (6,10,14-trimethylpentadecan-2-one, phytone) that was found in the oil from the dried sample at 5.91%. Another significant change in HD-D was a significant decrease (9.8 times for dibutyl phtalate) or disappearance (diisooctyl phtalate) of alkyl phthalates (
