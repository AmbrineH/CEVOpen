<p class="p">In the present study, two different methods were used to investigate the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> volatiles: headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and hydrodistillation (HD). Two fibers of different polarity (divinylbenzene/carboxene/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) and polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB)) were used for HS-SPME to obtain more complete headspace profiles. Different methods were chosen to obtain a comprehensive profile of the headspace, low and medium volatile compounds. First insight into 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00842-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> reveals meaningful differences among the headspace and distillate composition that was confirmed by statistical analysis. In addition, the composition of fresh and air-dried 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> differed notably among the headspace and distillate indicating the strong impact of drying (also confirmed by statistical analysis).
