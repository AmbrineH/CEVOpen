 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> (HS-F) was 2-thiapropane (dimethyl sulfide, DMS) ranging from 36.22% to 56.51%, being more abundant when applying HS-SPME with DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber. It has long been recognized that algae play a highly significant role in the global biogeochemical cycles of sulfur. The key chemical compounds driving these cycles are often low molecular weight and/or volatile compounds. In the case of sulfur, a dominant compound is dimethyl sulfide (DMS), algal osmolyte, which derives from dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) that has been synthetized and accumulated in a wide range of taxa which occur in diverse ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. DMSP and its breakdown products (e.g., DMS) readily scavenge hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen species and, thus, may serve as an antioxidant system (e.g., for the reduction of oxidative stress), regulated in part by DMSP enzymatic cleavage [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. DMPS has been found in green algae, and the spatial and temporal distribution of DMSP content in

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Heptadecane was another abundant compound (4.82%; 32.51%) in HS-F, being more abundant when applying HS-SPME with PDMS/DVB fiber. Saturated and olefinic hydrocarbons were already determined in different species of benthic marine algae [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Heptadecane dominated in red algae but was also abundant in

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In general, aliphatic hydrocarbons result from highly endergenic metabolic processes of fatty acids decarboxylation [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The results of an incubation of stearic-18-

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Several low-molecular aliphatic aldehydes were present, such as nonanal (3.51%; 2.51%), octanal (0.81%; 0.10%), and decanal (1.01%; 0.42%). They could originate from ω9 MUFAs and also from ω6 PUFAs, such as linoleic acid [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Aliphatic lower alcohols oct-1-en-3-ol (1.12%; 9.71%) and octan-1-ol (0.62%; 0.20%) were also found. The biosynthetic pathways of vinylic alcohols in diatoms include the lyase activity and utilize water from the medium, presumably to assist the carbon–carbon bond cleavage and lipoxygenase catalyzes both the oxygenation of arachidonic acid and the lyase reaction leading to the formation of oct-1-en-3-ol [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Another abundant compounds in HS-F were aromatic compounds (benzaldehyde (5.21%; 4.73%) and benzyl alcohol (9.31%; 0.20%)) that are known to derive from phenylalanine by shortening of the carbon skeleton side chain by the C
