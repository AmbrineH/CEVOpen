<p class="p">The main fatty acids of FD-CB were oleic acid (C18:1n9), as the dominant, followed by palmitic acid (C16:0), linoleic acid (C18:2n6), and stearic acid (C18:0). The total content of unsaturated fatty acids was higher than saturated reaching 57.68% (including both MUFAs (41.73%) and PUFAs (15.95%)). Generally, for green algae it is a characteristic that the amount of unsaturated fatty acids is higher than saturated fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Oleic acid (C18:0) with 36.54% was found as the main MUFA, while linoleic acid (C18:2n6

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and Banaimoon [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] showed that linolenic acid was the dominant PUFA in 
 <italic class="italic">Codium</italic> species. PUFAs are of great importance for human health due to their activities related to reducing the risk of heart diseases, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. In the present study, linolenic acid was present in both of the forms, α-linolenic (ω3; C18:3n3) with higher abundance and γ-linolenic (ω6; C18:3n6). ω6 Fatty acids were present at a higher percentage than ω3 fatty acids (

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] also reported that hexadecatrienoic acid was not detected in 
 <italic class="italic">C. fragile</italic>. A possible explanation is that the fatty acid content is influenced by geographical location and environment conditions [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. It must be taken into consideration that the fatty acid composition can vary among different species within the same genus and also within the same species which were collected at different locations in the same season. Moreover, fresh algal samples gave a higher amount of PUFAs than dried samples which can be explained by the susceptibility of PUFAs to oxidation processes [
