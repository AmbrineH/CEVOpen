<p class="p">The present research contributes toward better chemical characterization of marine green alga 
 <italic class="italic">Codium bursa</italic> (Olivi) C. Agardh from the Adriatic Sea. According to the obtained results, the composition of volatile compounds differed significantly considering applied extraction methods. The major headspace compound of HS-F was 2-thiapropane (DMS), while in HS-D it was present as a minor constituent. (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-phytol was obtained in HD-D and in the SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract as a major constituent, and its predominance was probably originated after chlorophyll breakdown. HD-F was abundant in higher aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as heptadecane and docosane, probably as the consequence of DMS loss. The presence of loliolide was determined only in SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extract. Therefore, the use of different methods enabled obtaining full chemical profiles of the headspace, volatile, and semi-volatile compounds and combined used of all of them can be recommended for chemical profiling of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> (the single-use one method would result with incomplete profiles that are clearly visible even with HS-SPME when two fibers revealed significantly different results). The obtained results for fatty acids of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> showed a predominance of unsaturated fatty acids over the saturated fatty acids. Oleic acid was found as the main fatty acid, followed by palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acid.
