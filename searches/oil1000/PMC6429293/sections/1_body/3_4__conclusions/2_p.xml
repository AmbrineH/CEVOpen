<p class="p">There is a significant difference in the activity against tested fungal species when H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and DMSO extracts were used that could be the influence of different solvent polarity to the compoundsâ€™ extraction. H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extract exhibited better antifungal effects against 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> spp., while DMSO extract was better for the inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum, A. flavus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophus</italic> spp. On the other hand, the extracts showed growth inducing properties for some fungal species. H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extract showed growth inducing properties when tested on 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic>, while DMSO extract showed inhibition properties. In general, it can be concluded that the extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> showed relatively good antifungal activity, especially against 
 <italic class="italic">P. expansum</italic>.
