 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] molecules. However, the species belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Codium</italic> have been the least investigated for their biological activity among all 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorophyceae. C. fragile</italic> has drawn the most attention due to its invasive nature and potential of being utilized for biomedical applications. Surget et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] reported its potential with pro-mineralogenic activity and osteogenic properties. Clerosterol possess great bioactivity potential including the inhibition of human melanoma cell growth [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Isolated clerosterol and its derivatives from 
 <italic class="italic">Codium arabicum</italic> exhibited cytotoxic activity [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Codium</italic> species were tested for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Methanol extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. dichotomum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. fragile</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. Bursa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. tomentosum</italic> showed significant inhibitory activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, while 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> did not inhibit the growth of tested bacteria. Antibacterial activity was influenced by the algal reproductive state and seasonality [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Ethanol extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> were used against
