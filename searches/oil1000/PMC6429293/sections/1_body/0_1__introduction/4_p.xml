<p class="p">In general, available data on the phytochemical composition and bioactivity of marine macroalgae from the Adriatic sea are limited. Consequently, the focus of this study was on macroalga 
 <italic class="italic">Codium bursa</italic> (Olivi) C. Agardh collected from the Adriatic Sea. It belongs to the family Codiaceae and phylum 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorophyta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and mostly, it can be found in temperate and subtropical areas [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. It grows in the range of a few millimeters up to 40 cm in diameter in hollow spherical form. This alga can satisfy its nutrient demands by recycling and preserving nutrient retention within the enclosed water with the presence of a unique microbial heterotrophic community [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Thick algal walls enable it to minimize the losses of nutrients which results in low nutrient requirements [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> is ranked among the slowest-growing macroalgae because of its low respiration and photosynthetic rates [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00842" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on its comprehensive headspace, volatile, and less-volatile organic compounds (among them biologically active molecules can be expected). The VOCs of fresh and corresponding air-dried sample of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> were investigated to detect the influence of drying on VOCs′ chemical composition determined by hydrodistillation (HD) and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Freeze-dried sample of 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> (FD-CB, as a more standardized sample) was further analyzed. It was subjected to supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extraction (SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) to determine less-volatile organic compounds that could not be isolated by hydrodistillation (HD) or HS-SPME. In addition, fatty acids’ profile and antifungal activity of FD-CB were also determined for the first time. The goals of present research on 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> were to: (a) investigate the phytochemical composition of fresh and air-dried 
 <italic class="italic">C. bursa</italic> by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after HS-SPME and HD; (b) analyze the less-volatile compounds of SC-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> extracts of FD-CB by GC-FID and GC-MS; (c) determine fatty acids profile of FD-CB after derivatization as methyl esters by GC-FID; and (d) get an insight into the antifungal activity of FD-CB extracts (with H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and DMSO) against most common mycotoxigenic fungi.
