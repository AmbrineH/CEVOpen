<p id="Par25" class="p">In conclusion, 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. meal can be used to replace completely FO without compromising growth. Among the diets tested in this study, the diet containing second highest level microalgae meal combined with SBO provided the best benefits in terms of slightly improved growth, and significantly higher antioxidant enzyme activity, lipase activity, and LC-PUFA content as well as indications of more available energy. Moreover, Pacific white shrimp displayed higher proportions of n-3/n-6 in treatment 6 (algae meal and LSO based diet) and 8 (only algae meal based diet as lipid source) in the tail muscle, which is healthier sea food preferred for human consumption. This study, therefore, demonstrates that 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. meal can be superior to the traditional ingredient, FO, in the diets of 
 <italic class="italic">L. vannamei</italic> which provided improved shrimp quality as a healthier food. Considering the relatively high cost of 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. meal, further research into optimal ratios with SBO could be worthwhile to improve feed cost-effectiveness.
