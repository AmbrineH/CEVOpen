<p id="Par20" class="p">Due to lower EPA levels in 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp., diets 4â€“6 were formulated with LSO, which contains relatively high amounts of ALA, which is a precursor to EPA synthesis. This was done since 
 <italic class="italic">L. vannamei</italic> has shown some ability for elongation and desaturation, although this ability is depressed when shrimp are fed with high levels of either ALA or LA

 </sup>. This is believed to be due to a feed-back mechanism

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, in this study, dietary LSO had no effect on muscle EPA content of the shrimp. This finding is in general agreement with other studies showing the fatty acid composition of 
 <italic class="italic">L. vannamei</italic> reflects that of the diet

 </sup>. In addition, dietary treatments significantly influenced the major fatty acids of the tail muscle (total MUFA, n-6 PUFA and ratio of n-3/n-6) of Pacific white shrimp in this study. Previous study suggested that for Pacific white shrimp production a range of lipid sources can be used for growth but a lipid source containing high levels of n-3 HUFA and high n-3/n-6 ratios are preferred for the shrimp being used for human consumption

 </sup>. In this study, shrimp fed with diets 6 and 8 followed by diet 1 displayed the highest n-3/n-6 ratios in the tail muscle compared to those fed with other diets. Therefore, our findings indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. meal could be used as better source than fish oil for shrimp feed because it provides better and healthier shrimp product for human food.
