<p id="Par24" class="p">In addition to shrimp tending to have higher lipid content in the diets with the highest levels of 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> meal, all shrimp fed a diet containing some microalgae meal had significantly lower moisture and ash content than those fed the control diet. This finding might indicate an improvement in osmoregulation; since at elevated salinities, shrimp need to remove excess minerals. Indeed, the use of high levels of dietary LC-PUFA improves osmoregulation at both low and high salinities in various crustaceans

 <italic class="italic">L. vannamei</italic> can be farmed in various salinity conditions, although a particular focus on low salinity waters would be beneficial since the production of shrimp in inland (low salinity waters) has become an emerging industry around the world
