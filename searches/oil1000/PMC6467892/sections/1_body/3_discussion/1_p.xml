<p id="Par19" class="p">The results of the present study indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> meal fed at different levels or in combinations with SBO and/or LSO as a replacer to FO did not cause a significant difference in the growth or feed efficiency of shrimp. Moreover, there were no indications of feed rejection when shrimp were fed diets without FO and shrimp appeared healthy throughout the feeding trial. In fact, shrimp fed diets with the highest amounts of the microalgae meal tended to have slightly higher growth than those fed the control diet with only FO as the added lipid source although differences were not statistically significant. In addition, the tail muscle fatty acids composition had significantly higher amounts of LC-PUFA compared to shrimp fed the control diet. FO can be completely replaced with SBO and LSO in the diet of

 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp.) meal as a fish oil replacer in fish meal free diets for shrimp, however the in the current study we have used the algae meal as a substitute to fish oil, but our experimental diets were fish meal-based diets (25% fish meal). Kumar

Algal meal combined with vegetable oil could replace 75% fish oil in shrimp diets. Recently, a combination of SBO, LSO, and beef tallow led to significantly better growth in 
 <italic class="italic">L. vannamei</italic> compared to FO only

 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Mortierella</italic> sp., are a viable replacement for FO in the diets of

 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp. had relatively high and low levels of DHA and EPA, respectively. An imbalance in these fatty acids in other microalgae meals was implicated as a potential reason for lower growth in the shrimp,
