<p id="Par22" class="p">One of the potential ways to determine the nutritional status of animals is the proximate composition of the animal including the adipocyte counts, which is a measurement of the fat content. Limited information is available on measuring adipocytes in aquatic animals, but adipocyte counts showed a similar pattern to the crude lipid content of the shrimp carcass. However, only adipocyte counts were affected by diet (with significantly higher counts in shrimp fed with diets 3 and 7). An increase in adipocyte counts could potentially be due to improved energy reserves or decreased lipid digestion. In terms of the latter, fatty acid digestion is greatly influenced by the carbon length and degree of saturation in the black tiger shrimp,

 </sup>. LC-PUFA generally tends to have a lower digestibility than SFA and MUFA, which further decreases with increasing carbon length

 </sup>. However, the high adipocyte counts found in shrimp fed diet 3 did not show any pattern related to carbon length, saturation, or any unique fatty acid type, group or ratio. In addition, for shrimp those fed with diet 3, the higher number of sub-epidermal adipose tissue was not linked to growth. Additional investigations are required to better elucidate the cause for higher adipocyte counts in diet 3.
