<p id="Par23" class="p">Alternatively, the high DHA content in shrimp those fed with diets 7 and 8 may have led to a lower digestibility and, thus, an accumulation of lipids. A decrease in digestibility is consistent with the high intestinal lipase activity found in shrimp fed both of these diets, but particularly in shrimp fed diet 8, which contained the highest amount of DHA. Crustaceans have the ability to modify their digestive enzymes as demonstrated in redclaw crayfish,
