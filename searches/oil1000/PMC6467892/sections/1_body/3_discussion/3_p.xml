<p id="Par21" class="p">Fatty acids with a high degree of saturation are more prone to lipid peroxidation. Despite the differences in the fatty acid composition among the shrimp, with the lowest and highest content of LC-PUFA in shrimp fed with diets 2 and 8, respectively, the amount of MDA in the tail muscle was unaffected by the diets. This may be due to fact that SOD and CAT activities were not disrupted, since these enzymes are primarily responsible for protecting animals from oxidative stress

 </sup>. In fact, SOD was significantly higher only for shrimp fed with diet 7, which corresponded to the highest CAT activity. A similar finding of enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity was observed in

 </sup>. Therefore, the higher muscle SOD and CAT activities in the current study may also indicate an improvement in the anti-oxidative status of the shrimp rather than a stress response. This also appears to be supported based on the fact that hemolymph parameters of the shrimp (including albumin, glucose, total protein, and globulin), which can indicate stress
