 </sup>. Currently, the world produces nearly 44 million tonnes of finfish products and nearly 3 million tonnes of crustaceans contributing at inland aquaculture farms (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO)

 </sup>. Among crustaceans produced in aquaculture, the Pacific white shrimp (
 <italic class="italic">Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>) is produced in the largest amount by far, which can be attributed to their fast growth, high market value, and higher resistance to disease
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>. As shrimp aquaculture has increased, demand for marine based ingredients, such as fish oil (FO) has also risen. This resource, however, is becoming more expensive, which is leading to investigations in identifying suitable alternatives without jeopardizing finfish and crustacean health

 </sup>. Among potential FO alternatives, oils from thraustochytrid microalgae, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Crypthecodinium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp., have been recognized as promising ingredients in aquafeeds due to their high long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) content and the fact that they result in similar or better growth performance compared to FO in various aquatic animals

 <italic class="italic">Ictalurus punctatus</italic>) fed diets with increasing amounts of dried 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> meal (0 to 20 g/kg) at the expense of catfish offal oil had significantly increased weight gain when fed at 10 or 15 g/kg

 </sup>. Similarly, when 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> was used as FO replacer for Atlantic salmon parr (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>) feed, growth was not compromised, and the microalgae oil was as digestible as FO also
