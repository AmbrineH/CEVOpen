<p id="Par18" class="p">The total adipocyte count in the tail muscle was significantly higher in shrimp those fed with diets 3 and 7 compared to those fed diets 1, 2, 5 and 6; shrimp fed diet 1 had the lowest adipocyte count (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>). The total cholesterol levels of the shrimp were unaffected by the dietary treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>). Intestinal lipase activity was lowest for shrimp fed diets 1, 4 and 5 and significantly lower than shrimp fed diets 7 or 8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>). The amount of MDA was unaffected among the different treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>). SOD activity in shrimp fed diet 7 was significantly higher than those fed with diets 1, 2, or 3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3B</xref>). Similarly, CAT activity was significantly higher in shrimp those fed diet 7 than all other diets, except diet 4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3C</xref>).
