<p id="Par15" class="p">Growth performance parameters were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) among the treatments, although FBW was numerically higher in shrimps fed with the diets 4, 6, 7, and 8 compared to the other diets (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Similarly, the feed efficiencies, including FCR, PER, PPV and LPV were also not significantly different among treatments. Differences in survival rate among treatments were not significant (Table
