<p id="Par17" class="p">The tail muscle fatty acids composition is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. Among the saturated fatty acids (SFA), palmitic acid (C16) was significantly higher in shrimp those fed with the diets 6–8 than those fed diets 1–4, while shrimp fed that diets 5–8 had significantly lower lignoceric acid (C24) levels than those fed diets 1–3. There was no significant difference for the total SFA level among the treatments. Among the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), C16:1n-7 was lower (p &lt; 0.05) in shrimp fed diet 4 than those fed diets 1, 6, 7, or 8, while oleic acid (C18:1n-9) in the muscle was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in shrimp fed diet 1 than all others except in shrimp fed with diet 2. Meanwhile, shrimp fed diet 1 had significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) gondoic acid (C20:1n-9) than those fed all other diets; the lowest amount was in shrimp fed diets 5, 6, 7, and 8. Shrimp fed with diets 1, 6, or 8 had significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) LA than all others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>), while αALA was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in shrimp fed diets 5 and 6 than all other treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>). There was significant influence of dietary treatments on the total MUFA level, and the highest level was observed in the group fed diet 1 trailed by diets 2 and 3, respectively. Treatments 2–5 displayed higher total n-6 PUFA level compared to the control (fish oil) and groups 6–8. The total n-3 PUFA level was unaffected by the experimental diets (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Among the LC-PUFAs, EPA decreased with increasing amounts of microalgae meal in the diets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C</xref>), while DHA significantly increased with higher dietary inclusions of algae meal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1D</xref>). The total LC-PUFA level was unaffected. Shrimp fed diets 6, 8, and 1 displayed the highest n-3 and n-6 ratio compared to those fed with other diets, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>).
