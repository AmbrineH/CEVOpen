 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and muscle samples from five shrimp in each tank were analyzed for their fatty acid composition by quantitative gas chromatography (utilizing C23:0 as an internal standard). Total cholesterol from the muscle was analyzed using a colorimetric total cholesterol assay kit according to manufacturer instructions (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA). Absorbance was read on a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Muscle samples (with digesta) from six shrimps in each replicate were immediately stored at −80 °C. For analysis, the samples were thawed in an ice bath and homogenized using an ultrasonic processor (Cole Parmer Scientific Experts, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) for 5 min in an ice bath. The samples were then placed in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Fisher Bioreagents, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) and cell lysis solution (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).
