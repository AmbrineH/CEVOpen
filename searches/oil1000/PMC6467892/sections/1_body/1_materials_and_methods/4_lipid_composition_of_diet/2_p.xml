<p id="Par13" class="p">The activities of lipase, catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the contents of lipid peroxide and adipogenesis were analyzed using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Intestinal lipase activity was measured using a QuantiChrom lipase assay kit (DLPS-100; BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) according to manufacturer instructions; absorbance was read at 412 nm. The CAT and SOD activities in the tail muscle were measured using commercial test kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); absorbance was read at 540 nm and 460 nm, respectively. Lipid peroxide in tail muscle was measured by analyzing the malondialdehyde (MDA) level using a colorimetric/fluorometric assay kit (BioVision Incorporated, Milpitas, CA, USA) according to manufacturer instructions; absorbance was read at 532 nm. Adipogenesis was measured by quantifying triglyceride accumulation in muscle tissue. The sub-epidermal adipose tissue amounts were analyzed using an Adipogenesis Assay kit (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan); absorbance was read at 570 nm.</p>
