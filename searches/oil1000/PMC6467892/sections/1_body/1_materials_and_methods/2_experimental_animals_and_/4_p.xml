<p id="Par9" class="p">Throughout the feeding trial, the water temperature was maintained at approximately 29 °C by an immersion heater. Salinity was maintained by adding fresh water to replace water loss from evaporation or additional salt to replace losses due to filter flushing. The pH, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen were measured once per day using a Hydrolab Quanta meter (Hydrolab Corporation, Loveland, CO). The shrimp were subjected to a photoperiod of 12 h:12 h light: dark cycle by overhead fluorescent ceiling lights. In the morning and evening, all aquaria were siphoned daily to remove uneaten feed and feces. The total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrite-N (NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-N) concentrations were measured once per week on a Hach DR 3800 spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer instructions (Hach, USA). If the TAN or NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-N exceeded 0.5 mg/L, a partial water exchange was performed.
