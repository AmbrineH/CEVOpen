<p id="Par6" class="p">Post larvae of Pacific white shrimp (
 <italic class="italic">Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>) were purchased from the private shrimp hatchery (Shrimp Improvement Systems, LLC, Islamorada, FL, USA) and gradually acclimated to a shrimp nursery system at the department of aquaculture, Kentucky State University, Frankfort, KY, USA. A 1,000-L rearing tank (used as a recirculating nursery system) connected to a solid settling tank and a matured biological filter (Red-Ewald, Karnes City, TX, USA) to maintain optimum water parameter conditions for shrimp larvae. Artificial seawater was made by mixing Crystal Sea Marine salt mix (Marine Enterprises International, LLC, Baltimore, MD) with dechlorinated municipal water to a salinity of 34 parts per thousand (ppt). The rearing tanks were provided gentle aeration (ceramic diffusers). Gradually salinity was decreased to 27–28 ppt by addition of freshwater over two weeks acclimation period and were fed commercially available shrimp diets (Zeigler Brothers Inc.).
