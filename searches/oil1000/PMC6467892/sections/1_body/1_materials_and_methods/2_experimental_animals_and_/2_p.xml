<p id="Par7" class="p">A total of 600 juvenile shrimp (3.15 ± 0.08 g) were individually weighed, divided into 24 groups consisting of 25 shrimp each, and placed into 110-L glass aquaria. After stocking the shrimp, the eight treatment diets were randomly allocated in triplicate. The aquaria were connected to a 2000-L mechanical and biological propeller-washed bead filtration system (Red-Ewald, Karnes City, TX, USA) at a salinity of 27–28 ppt. Each aquarium was supplied with seawater at a rate of 4.0 L/min and optimum aeration was provided by single 12-inch air diffusers by Rotron blower (Ametek, Kent, OH, USA).</p>
