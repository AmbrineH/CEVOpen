<p id="Par14" class="p">All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the SAS/STAT software (SAS, 1988). If significant differences were detected (p &lt; 0.05), means of dependent variables were compared using Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test. Our data were represented as mean ± SEM.</p>
