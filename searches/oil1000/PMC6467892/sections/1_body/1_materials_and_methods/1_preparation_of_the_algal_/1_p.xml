<p id="Par5" class="p">The fermented algae, 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> sp., was used in the current study (Source: Alltech Lexington, KY, USA). The fermented algae were continuously centrifuged (5,000 g) to obtain the solid thereafter sprayed dried yielding a fine algae powder. Kochiwa spray dryer [using centrifugal atomization (4,500 g) at an inlet temperature (140–150 °C), central chamber (130–135 °C) and an outlet temperature of (80–85 °C)] were used to prepare the spray-dried powder. It took 6–8 sec to form the algae powder after injection. The proximate composition was measured according to standard Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods

 </sup>, which showed this meal contained a lipid content of 66%. The proximate composition of ingredients such as SBM, wheat meal, and wheat gluten were similarly measured. A total of eight iso-nitrogenous diets (containing 40% protein) and iso-energetic (9.0% lipid) were formulated to contain increasing amounts of the algae meal (containing 660 g/kg extractable lipid; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Regardless of the diet, fishmeal (FM) and soybean meal (SBM) were the dominant protein sources and were added to all experimental diets at 250 and 397 g/kg, respectively. The amount of crude protein, lipid, vitamins, and minerals were formulated to meet the requirements of penaeid shrimp

 </sup>. The control diet (diet 1) had 6% FO as the main lipid source, which is similar to the amount used in commercial diets (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Diets 2 and 3 had increasing amounts of algae meal and SBO at the expense of FO. FO was completely replaced in diet 4 with a combination of algae meal, SBO, and LSO. Diets 5–8 also contained no FO, but had different combinations of lipids: diet 5 had equal amounts of LSO and SBO at 8 g/kg; diets 6 and 7 contained equal amounts of algae meal, but with LSO or SBO added at 8 g/kg, respectively; diet 8 contained only algae meal as the only added lipid source, with the highest inclusion at 75 g/kg. Wheat meal was adjusted in the experimental diets to compensate for the small amount of crude protein in the algae meal (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Meanwhile, 
 <italic class="italic">Schizochytrium</italic> meal is low in EPA, but can be synthesized by some aquatic animals from the precursor, ALA. Therefore, LSO, which is high in ALA, was added in diets 4–6 to determine whether this could result in high EPA levels in the shrimp. Dried feed ingredients were thoroughly grinded and mixed in mixer (Hobart A200, Hobart, Troy, OH, USA) to prepare the shrimp diets. Followed by warm water addition to maintain the 35% moisture and mixed for another 10 min. This dough of each diet was passed via feed pelletizer (meat grinder, Glen Mills Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA) with a 2-mm die followed by air dried for 24 hours. Long strands of diets were pulverized with grinder (Glen Mills Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA) and obtained 2 mm pellet size via using sieve. After sieving, appropriate amounts of LSO, SBO, and FO were manually added to inhibit the damage of highly unsaturated fatty acids during pelletizing. After the diets were dried, chemical composition including fatty acids of diets was determined
