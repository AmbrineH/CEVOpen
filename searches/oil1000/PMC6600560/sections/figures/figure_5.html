 <p> Morphology of the pine nut of P. cembroides. ( A) Intact seed used to determine the weight of the seed. 1 = Vertical line used for the determination of the seed length. 2 = Horizontal line that represents the measurement used to determine the width of the seed. 3 = Measurement of the seed area. In the lower part, an intact scarified seed used to determine the weight of the megagametophyte. 4 = Vertical line used for megagametophyte length determination. 5 = Horizontal line that represents the measurement used to determine the width of megagametophyte. 6 = Area of megagametophyte. 7 = Perimeter of megagametophyte. ( B) Morphology of the intact seed of La Florida, Cardonal (LFCH), San Miguel Tlazintla, Cardonal (SMCH), Jagüey Colorado, Zimapán (JCZH), Fontezuelas, Metztitlán (FMH), Malpaso Curves, Cuauhtémoc (CMCC). The intermediate part represents the seed coat and the lower part of the scarified seed. </p>
