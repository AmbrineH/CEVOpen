<p class="p">Prior to the proximate analyses, 50 seeds were randomly selected and pooled from each population, and were scarified manually using the methodology described previously. Once peeled, megagametophytes were weighed (AD
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, model HR-250A) and triturated in a blade miller (Nutribullet
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, mod. NB-101B, Los Angeles, CA, USA) until a homogeneous paste was obtained. The trituration of pine nut was performed at 4 °C for 5 min. In this condition, the proximate analyses were determined on three analytical replicates per each population and were determined according to the AOAC [

 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, mod. 1324, Cornelius, OR, USA) (AOAC, 930.15). The ashes content was quantified by the incineration of the samples at 550 °C for 12 h to constant weight (Felisa
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, mod. FE-340, Guadalajara, Jalisco, México) (AOAC, 923.03). The total protein content was performed by measurement of the total nitrogen using the Kjeldahl method (Labcono
