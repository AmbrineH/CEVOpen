<p class="p">Total flavonoid content was determined according to the methodology defined by Georgé et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Briefly, 31 μL of standard extracts were taken and placed in a well of a microplate. Then, 125 μL of distilled water and 9.3 μL of 5% NaNO

Then, the mixture was incubated for 30 min in the absence of light and the absorbance was measured at 510 nm in a BioRad xMark Plus (Hercules, CA, USA), and the data were obtained with the Microplate Manager 6.0 (Tokyo, Japan) computer software. For quantification of the total flavonoid content, a calibration curve was performed using catechin as a standard and results were expressed as mg catechin equivalents by 100 g of dry weight (mg CE/100 g DW). All determinations were made in triplicate.
