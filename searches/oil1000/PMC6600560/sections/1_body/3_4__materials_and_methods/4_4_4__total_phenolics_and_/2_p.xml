<p class="p">Phenolic content was determined according to the methodology defined by Georgé et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Briefly, 100 μL of standard extracts were taken into a test tube and 500 μL of the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was added allowed to stand for 2 min. Thereafter, 400 μL of Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> were added. Then, the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 15 min. Finally, the mixture was cooled in an ice bath and 250 μL were collected and placed in a microplate well. Absorbance was measured at 740 nm in a BioRad xMark Plus (Hercules, CA, USA), and data were obtained with the Microplate Manager 6.0 (Tokyo, Japan) computer software. A calibration curve was performed using gallic acid as a standard and results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents by 100 g of dry weight (DW) (mg GAE/100 g DW). All determinations were made in triplicate.
