<p class="p">Normality of frequency distributions was tested by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. A one-way ANOVA was performed to test for differences in morphometry and chemical composition of seed data. Pearson’s correlation was carried out to test for correlation between morphometry and chemical seed composition data. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v.8.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The web-based software NIA array analysis tool [
