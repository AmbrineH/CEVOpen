 <italic class="italic">Opuntia rastreta</italic>. The selection of the provenances was mainly done because of these localities are lands in which there is a traditional collection of pine nuts and these areas are in the process of evaluation to become germplasm producing zones. 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02057-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the geographical and climatic characteristics of the provenances where the collection of the biological material was carried out. Climatic and geographical data were obtained from the database of the National Meteorological System of the National Water Commission from the historical period data of 1950 to 2010.
