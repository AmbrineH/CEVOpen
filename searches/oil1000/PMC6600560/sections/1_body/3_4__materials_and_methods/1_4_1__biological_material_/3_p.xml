<p class="p">In each place, in order to collect the greatest variability of each of the sampled areas, 20 trees located 20 m from each other were randomly selected. The selection of the trees consisted of detecting healthy and vigorous trees. From each tree, ten cones distributed throughout the tree crown were collected. Cones were placed into an airtight polyethylene bag and immediately transported to the laboratory, where samples from each population were stored at room temperature until the cones were opened (20 days). Seeds were separated from the cones and stored in an airtight polyethylene bag at 4 Â°C.</p>
