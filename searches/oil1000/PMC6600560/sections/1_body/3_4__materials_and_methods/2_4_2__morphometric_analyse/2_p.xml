<p class="p">Individual seed weight was determined using an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo AJ150, Ciudad de México, México). Length and width measurements were made on individual seed using a digital Vernier with precision of 0.01 mm (model CD: 15CP 500-181). To determine the weight of the seed coat and megagametophyte, 20 seeds were randomly selected and were scarified manually with the help of mechanical tweezers trying not to damage the megagametophyte (

Then, megagametophytes were digitally photographed under a stereomicroscope, and the images were used to determine the area, perimeter, length, and diameter of the megagametophyte using an image analysis software (ImageJ, Bethesda, MD, USA) (
