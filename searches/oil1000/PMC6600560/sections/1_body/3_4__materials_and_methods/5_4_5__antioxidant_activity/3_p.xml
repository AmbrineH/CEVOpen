<p class="p">To determine the antioxidant activity by ABTS
 <sup class="sup">++</sup> assay, 12 μL of the standard extract was placed in a well of a microplate and 285 μL of the ABTS reagent was added. Then, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in absence of light and the absorbance was read at 734 nm using a Bio-Rad microplate reader. Results were expressed as the inhibition percentage of ABTS
 <sup class="sup">++</sup>. To determine the IC50 of ABTS
 <sup class="sup">++</sup>, TROLOX reactive was used as a standard and results were expressed as mmol TROLOX equivalents per 100 g of dry weight (TE/100 g DW). The IC50 was determined in the percentage inhibition plot with respect to the concentration of the sample, defined as the amount of the sample (mg/mL) necessary to obtain a 50% inhibition of the ABTS
 <sup class="sup">++</sup> radical. All determinations were made in triplicate.
