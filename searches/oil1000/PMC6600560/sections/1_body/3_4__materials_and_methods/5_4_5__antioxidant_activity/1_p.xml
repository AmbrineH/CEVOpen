<p class="p">The total antioxidant activity was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays using the methodology according to Thaipong et al. [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. For DPPH assay, the solutions were prepared in 80% methanol. DPPH solution (60 mM) was prepared in methanol and was mixed in a 96-well microplate. Briefly, 25 μL of the standard extract was placed in a well of a microplate and 200 μL of the DPPH solution was added. Then, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in absence of light and the absorbance was read at 517 nm every min for 1 h. TROLOX was used as standard and results were expressed as mmol TROLOX equivalents per 100 g of dry weight (TE/100 g DW). All determinations were made in triplicate.
