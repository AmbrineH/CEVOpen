<p class="p">The FRAP assay, 24 μL of the standard extract was placed in a well of a microplate and 180 μL FRAP reagent was added. Then, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and the absorbance was read at 595 nm every min for 30 min using a Bio-Rad microplate reader. TROLOX reactive was used as standard and results were expressed as mmol TROLOX equivalents per 100 g of dry weight (TE/100 g DW). All determinations were made in triplicate.</p>
