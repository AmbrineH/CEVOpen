<p class="p">In Mexico, fifteen species of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> sp. produce edible nuts. These developed plant communities of three represent an essential resource for the populations and the surrounding environment of these zones because they play roles in maintaining the hydrological regime of the basins, modulating local microclimates, and providing shelter and food for associated wildlife and domestic livestock. 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species are also sources of wood, resins, and seeds for a wide range of applications.
