<p class="p">In Mexico, the forest with the greatest distribution and territorial extension is formed mainly by 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus cembroides</italic> Zucc. [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The distribution of this specie included the states of Aguascalientes, Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Jalisco, State of Mexico, Nuevo Leon, Puebla, Querétaro, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, Tamaulipas, Tlaxcala, Veracruz, and Zacatecas [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In the Mexican highlands, 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> occupies transition zones due to its ability for adaptation and remarkable resistance to adverse climatic and poor soil conditions, in such zones it can grow in shallow soils with pH values ranging from 4 to 8. These characteristics make 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> trees suitable for reforestation of semiarid or eroded arid, habitats which have been extensively impoverished historically by intensive agriculture and cattle feed activities [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the populations of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> are being threatened by global warming, fire, pests, diseases, and anthropogenic activities, altogether contributing to massive deterioration of the inhabiting ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In the states of Hidalgo and Chihuahua, one of the most important species in the production of pine nut is 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The population of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> located in these areas has been subject to self-consumption and trading to neighboring communities. However, as it also happens in other regions of Mexico, the production of pine nuts has many limitations: (i) it is carried out in the rustic format, (ii) the collectors do not have an adequate training, (iii) a lack of technical management of the stands, and (iv) lack of a proper system of quality control of the collected seeds [
