<p class="p">This study presents the morphology and chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic>, which complement the chemical composition previously reported. The results confirm that seeds of SMCH and JCZH population of Hidalgo State could be considerate to be used as seed selection for a reproduction program, because these provenances had the longest, widest, and heaviest pine nuts. Seed chemical composition obtained in this study also demonstrate that JCZH and FMH population of Hidalgo state had the highest content of water, lipids, protein, flavonoids and antioxidant activity, while CMCC population of Chihuahua State presented the highest contents of ash and carbohydrates. Furthermore, temperature (i.e., mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature) could be the most important climatic variables for seed morphology and chemical composition. The seed of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> could be a rich source of important nutrients that appear to have a very positive on human health. In the future, a multiyear study should be done taking into account the measurement of several years of seed collection, as well as the correlation with the soil, climate, and geographic data, in combination with the analysis of lipid, amino acid, and protein profiles could help us to make a more robust data set and corroborate this hypothesis most strongly.
