<p class="p">Until now, few studies of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> variability based in the morphological and chemical composition of pine nut have been conducted in the forests of the states of Hidalgo and Chihuahua, Mexico. In the present study, we assessed the natural variability of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> by making a comparison of morphological traits and chemical composition of the seed from five different populations located in the two mentioned states. The results showed statistically significant differences among populations (

San Miguel Tlazintla, Cardonal, Hidalgo (SMCH) and Jagüey Colorado, Zimapán, Hidalgo (JCZH) populations presented the highest values in unshelled seed (i.e., weight, length, and width), seed coat weight, and shelled seed (i.e., megagametophyte weight, length, width, area, and perimeter) (
