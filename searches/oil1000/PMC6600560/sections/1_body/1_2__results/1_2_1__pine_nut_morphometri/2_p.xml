<p class="p">The difference found in the values in morphometry of seeds among the five populations was statistically significant; this could be associated with the difference in the ecological environment as well as the genotypic and phenotypic variability of this species of pine. In this direction, we correlated the geographical and climatic data of the location of population included in our study. The results showed that seed length (r= −0.86, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> =0.05) and megagametophyte weight (r = −0.86, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05) were inversely correlated with latitude range of seed source, but positively correlated with the megagametophyte perimeter (r = 0.95, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.01). Furthermore, longitude range of seed source showed a direct correlation with seed length (r = 0.87, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05) and megagametophyte weight (r = 0.87, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05) and an inverse correlation with the megagametophyte perimeter (r = −0.95, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.01). Additionally, seed length, seed width, seed coat weight, megagametophyte weight, and length showed a statistically significant inverse correlation with mean monthly maximum temperature (

Thereby, populations located geographically in the northern areas would be expected to have higher pine nut morphometry and weight than southern populations. Nonetheless, these parameters would decrease accordingly with the overall temperature of each provenance.
