Ash content was higher for the population of CMCC, while LFCH presented the lowest ash content. Total lipid content ranged from 58.4% (JCZH) to 48.4% (CMCC). The protein content of pine nut varied from 15.7% (LFCH) to 19.1% (JCZH). On the other hand, carbohydrates from CMCC presented the highest values, while JCZH presented the lowest ones. The difference in the values found, in chemical composition among the five population was statistically significant, and this could also be related to the difference in the ecological condition, as well as genotypic and phenotypic variability. In this direction, data were also correlated with the geographical and climatic data of population location. The results showed no statistically significant differences with the geographical location. However, when location was correlated with the climatic data, the mean monthly maximum temperature was an inverse correlation with total lipids (
