<p class="p">In general, several methods have been used to assess the total antioxidant capacity of pine nuts. In this study, we determined the antioxidant activity by three different methods. The DPPH quenching value confirmed that seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> presented a quenching capacity and a hydrogen donor capacity, and it slightly oscillated among the population from 63.4 to 66.7 mmol TE g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The FRAP assay measures the ability of the sample to reduce Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> (ferric ion) to Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> (ferrous ion) in the presence of antioxidants. This methodology also showed slight variation among the population from 21.9 to 26.2 mmol TE g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Finally, the ABTS
 <sup class="sup">++</sup> assay measures the capacity of the radical to donate a proton, which allows the analysis of hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Using this methodology, results showed a wide variation from 10.9 to 28.2 mmol TE g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> among populations. However, as consensus the three assays for measuring the antioxidant activity showed that FMH presented the highest activity, while the population of SMCH presented the lowest antioxidant capacity as determined by DPPH and ABTS methodologies, and CMCC by FRAP assay (

We could not observe a significant correlation between parameters associated with the antioxidant activity of seed and the geographical location. However, when the antioxidant activity of the seeds was correlated with the climatic data, the mean monthly temperature was positively correlated with the antioxidant activity determined by DPPH assay (
