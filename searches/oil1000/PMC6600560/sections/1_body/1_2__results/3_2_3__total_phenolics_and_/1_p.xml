<p class="p">Currently, the content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds found in fruits and plant seed, particularly in nuts, has emerged as desirable characteristic for consumption as part of the human diet given their diverse benefits of these bioactive molecules have been demonstrated to act as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and antifungal activities. The analysis of total phenolic contents demonstrated that seed of

We could not observe statistically significant correlation when compared the phenolic and flavonoid compounds of seeds to geographical location. However, when these were correlated with the climatic data, the mean monthly minimum temperature was positively correlated with flavonoids (
