<p class="p">Both analyses showed that JCZH and FMH populations of the state of Hidalgo showed a substantial similarity between seed morphometry and chemical composition determined in this study, while SMCH and LFCH populations of the state of Hidalgo were clustered inside this group (

Principal components analysis also showed that the first two components explained 91.72% of the total variability, with 76.1% and 15.7%, respectively (

These results confirm that the phytochemical of pine nut grown in both states could be a significant influence on the separation of the population than morphological characteristics. JCZH and FMH population showed a tendency to present values higher in water content, total flavonoids, and antioxidant activity (
