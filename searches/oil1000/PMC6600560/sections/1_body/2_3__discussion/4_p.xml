<p class="p">Pine nut of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> could be a good source of essential fatty acid and hence a good source of dietary energy. Wolff and Marpeau [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] determined that the dehulled seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> in the United States are a good source of oil (64%) with desirable fatty acid composition, including high levels of oleic (47%) and linoleic (41%) acids, but only 10% of saturated acids. Sagrero-Nieves [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] found that seed coat of pine nut of several phenotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> from the central region of Veracruz showed differences in myristic (3.4–9.1%), oleic (36.7–47.2%), and linoleic (32.9–44.5%) acids. Total lipids determined in this study were higher compared to those determined for 
 <italic class="italic">P. pinea</italic> (36.7%), 
 <italic class="italic">P. halepensis</italic> (19.7%), 
 <italic class="italic">P. pinaster</italic> (24.1%), and 
 <italic class="italic">P. canariensis</italic> (23.9%) located from North of Algeria [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Furthermore, total lipids were higher compared with the determined for the species of 
 <italic class="italic">P. monophylla</italic> (23%), 
 <italic class="italic">P. maximartinezii</italic> (42.5%), and 
 <italic class="italic">P. quadrifolia</italic> (37%) species [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Loewe-Muñoz et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] found an average of 40.2% of lipids in seed collected of three different macrozones of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pinea</italic> in Chile, which is lower than values determined in this study, and these variations can be due to the soil composition between regions and with the species [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>].
