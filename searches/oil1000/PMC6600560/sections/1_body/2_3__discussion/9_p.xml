<p class="p">Some studies have shown that seed morphology and chemical composition variation could reflect the environmental conditions of the location where the 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species grow. Our result showed that latitude, longitude, and mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature were the most important climatic variable for unshelled and shelled pine nut characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02057-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A–E). These results agreed with Loewe-Muñoz et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], who found that temperature (i.e., average summer temperature, maximum summer temperature, maximum average temperature, and thermal oscillation) was the most important climatic variables for cone, in-shell pine nut characteristics, and kernel weight variation across Chilean macrozones. Furthermore, our result showed that monthly maximum temperature showed an inverse correlation with total lipids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02057-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A) and these were positively correlated with carbohydrate contents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02057-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B). Lutz et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] showed that ash, protein, and lipid contents exhibited significant correlation with the temperature of seed origin of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pinea</italic> from Chile forest areas. Some studies have demonstrated that phytochemical contents vary widely among and within the different nut genotypes. However, other variables as the harvesting and environmental stresses (i.e., starvation, infection, predation, and UV light) could modulate the capacity for phytochemical synthesis [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Our results showed that mean monthly temperature and mean monthly minimum temperature were positively correlated with flavonoids and antioxidant activity determined by DPPH assay. Our result partially agreed with those reported by Lutz et al., [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], who showed that α-tocopherol contents exhibited significant correlation with the temperature of seed origin of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pinea</italic> from Chile forest areas. Therefore, these results support that variation in the chemical and phytochemical composition of pine nut could be related to factors associated with (i) climatic conditions (i.e., temperature and temperature oscillations), (ii) physiological condition of plant (i.e., ripening and desiccation), and (iii) sanitary condition (i.e., attacks from pests) [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The analysis of the protein profile of seed of 
 <italic class="italic">P. pinea</italic> collected of 30 populations distributed along a climatic gradient in Chile forest areas also demonstrated that the differentiation among them was more dependent on the environmental factors than on the genetics [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The principal component analysis has shown that accumulated rainfall, hydric deficit, and minimum average temperature were the climate variables mostly related to the principal component, showing clear correlations between proteins and the geoclimatic environment [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Principal components analysis also showed that the populations varied significantly in water content, total flavonoid and antioxidant activity (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-02057-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Lutz et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] established that the content of fiber, ashes, moisture, protein, and lipids of pine nuts are useful to segregate the three Chilean macrozones of
