<p class="p">Phenolic and flavonoid compounds are an essential group of bioactive molecules found in plant seeds and exhibit various biological activities when these are included in the diet. Phenolic content of pine nut of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cembroides</italic> showed an average of 5.5%. Although there are no previous results for this species, the results determined in this study were lower than those ones detected in pine nut of
