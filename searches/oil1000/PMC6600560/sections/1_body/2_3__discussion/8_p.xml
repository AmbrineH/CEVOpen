<p class="p">In this study, the total antioxidant activity was carried out using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assays. These methods are based on the same mechanism of propensity to donate hydrogens [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Our results showed a variation in the averages according to the population and the method used to determine these chemical compounds. The results showed that FMH population of the state of Hidalgo presented the highest activity, while the population of SMCH presented the lowest antioxidant capacity determined by DPPH and ABTS methodologies, and CMCC by FRAP assay. Some studies have established that the presence of phenolic and flavonoid contents in an extract could be related to a high antioxidant capacity. Our results showed a negative correlation between the total phenolic content and DPPH (r = −0.81, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.09), ABTS
 <sup class="sup">++</sup> (r = −0.452, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.44), and FRAP (r = −0.442, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.45). These results were opposite to those ones found in pine nut of 
 <italic class="italic">P. gerardiana</italic>, where total phenolic content exhibited significant positive correlation with DPPH (r = 0.867), ABTS

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. However, when flavonoid content was correlated with the antioxidant activity ABTS (r = 0.87, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05), it was highest than FRAP (r = 0.83, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.08) and DPPH (r = 0.76, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.13). In addition, when the methods used to determine the antioxidant activity were correlated with each other, FRAP and ABTS (r = 0.99, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) were higher than FRAP and DPPH (r = 0.563, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.32), and DPPH and ABTS (r = 0.533, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.35). Negative correlations indicate that the antioxidant capacity of most samples does not depend only on the content of phenolic compounds. Previous phytochemical analysis of the pine nuts composition has shown the presence of phytosterols, carotenoids, tocopherols, vitamin C, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid; all of them with proven antioxidant capacity, whose concentrations exceed that of phenolic compounds [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, given the high relation between the antioxidant activity determined by ABTS assay and the flavonoid content, these compounds content could be a good indicator of the presence of antioxidants compounds for pine nut of
