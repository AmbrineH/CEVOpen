<p class="p">The Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are the cause of severe infections in humans, and due to their ability to survive in harsh conditions they may cause hospital infections. The use of natural products would be a helpful way to reduce the risk of growth of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. There is a need to develop alternative antimicrobial products from plants to support antibacterial therapy in the treatment of infectious diseases. Essential oils exhibit antimicrobial activity and affect processes occurring in cells that could alter human cell viability. This makes it necessary to confront the concentration that would have a cytotoxic effect on human cells with MIC.</p>
