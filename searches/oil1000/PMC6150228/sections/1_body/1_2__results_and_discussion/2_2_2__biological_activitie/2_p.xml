 <xref rid="molecules-22-01880-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). When compared to those of thymol, which was used as a positive control, the tested oils showed rather low antimicrobial properties. Despite the fact that the compositions of seed and cone essential oils are different, the results of the antimicrobial screening showed that the 
 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> seed oil exhibited almost identical antibacterial properties to cone oil (minimal inhibitory concentrations was in the range of 26 to 30 μL/mL). It is due to a high and similar content of monoterpene hydrocarbons in both essential oils (93 g/100 g of seed oil, 79 g/100 g of cone oil), which in contrast to oxygenated terpenes show the lowest antibacterial activity, even hydrocarbons tend to be relatively inactive. This is caused by their structure that limits hydrogen bound capacity and water solubility, and as a result, limits their diffusion through the medium. Limonene, α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, and β-myrcene, which are the predominant oil components showed a very low or no antimicrobial activity. On the other hand, more polar molecules like alcohols, aldehydes or ketones, ethers, or oxides, are active, but with differing specificity and levels of activity, which is related to the present functional group, but also associated with hydrogen-bounding parameters in all cases [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-22-01880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Surprisingly, we did not notice the differences of antimicrobial activity between seed and cone oils of white fir, although the concentration of oxygenated derivatives of mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes in cone essential oils was ten times higher (10% of all volatiles) than in seed oil (0.9% of all oil compounds). Thymol, was used as a positive control, and obviously was much more effective against tested bacteria strains than the 
 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> oils. It is well known that the essential oil constituents confer antimicrobial activity by damaging the cell membrane and wall, leading to cell lysis, leakage of cell contents, as well the inhibition of proton motive force [
