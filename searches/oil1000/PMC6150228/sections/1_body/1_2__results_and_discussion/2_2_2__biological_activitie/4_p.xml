<p class="p">Two essential oils (
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> seeds and 
 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> cones) were examined in a cell viability test on human fibroblasts, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-tetrazolium bromide (MTT). Thymol was used as a positive control. The results of cytotoxicity of the tested oils are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-01880-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. It was observed that at a concentration of 0–0.075 μL/mL the oils were rather safe. Their IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value fluctuated around 0.110 μL/mL (
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> cones) and 0.125 μL/mL (
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> seeds). The influence of oils on normal cells was weak when compared to thymol, whose IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> fluctuated around 75 μg/mL, which corresponds to ca. 0.075 μL/mL (due to the melting point of thymol which was weighted). The effect of oils was confirmed by DNA synthesis. The oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> cones at a concentration of 0.110 μL/mL decreased DNA synthesis to 86% of the control value. The oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> seeds at a concentration of 0.125 μL/mL decreased DNA synthesis to 66% of the control value. Thymol used as a positive control reduced DNA synthesis to 20% and 15% of the control value, respectively. The influence of white fir essential oils was also examined in a cell viability test on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), using MTT. The studies demonstrated that the tested essential oils were cytotoxic to HMEC-1 at concentrations lower than the MIC. The oil from 
 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> cones was less toxic than the seed oil. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of seed and cone essential oil was 1.0 μL/mL and 1.38 μL/mL, respectively.
