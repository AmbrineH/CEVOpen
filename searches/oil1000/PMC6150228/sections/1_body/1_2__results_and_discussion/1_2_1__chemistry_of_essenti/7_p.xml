<p class="p">Natural essential oil that contains chiral molecules often shows the presence of a predominant enantiomer for each pair, and the enantiomeric ratio is therefore a value that characterizes the genuineness of an oil [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-22-01880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The enantiomeric excess of limonene, α- and β-pinene as well as camphene, is listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01880-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The levorotatory form of the main monoterpene hydrocarbons constituting the seed and cone oils of the investigated fir is largely predominant over the dextrorotatory form. This dependence was also observed for the above mentioned monoterpene hydrocarbons, which are the components of essential oils from the seeds and cones of
