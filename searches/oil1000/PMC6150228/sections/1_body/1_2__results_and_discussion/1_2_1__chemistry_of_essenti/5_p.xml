<p class="p">Among volatile terpenes, the oxygenated derivatives of sesquiterpenes were detected in the analyzed white fir at the lowest level in both seed (0.21 g/100 g) and cone oils (0.04 g/100 g). This group consisted mainly of τ-cadinol and τ-muurol. However, this terpene group was detected in the

Higher than in white fir oils, the amount of oxygenated sesquiterpenes has been found previously in the silver fir seed cone oils (up to 1.5%) and Korean fir seed and cone oils (up to 1.6%). Intermedeol and selin-6-en-ol were the main one [
