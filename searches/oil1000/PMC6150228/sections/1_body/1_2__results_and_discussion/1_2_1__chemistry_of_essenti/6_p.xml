<p class="p">As it is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-01880-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the quantitative as well as qualitative compositions of seed and cone oil of white fir are different. Despite the fact that all of the main compounds, i.e., monoterpene hydrocarbons, were identified in seed and cone essential oils, many terpenes occurred only in one of the examined oils. Finally, among the 98 compounds identified in both white fir oils, 61 volatiles were detected in the seed oil, while 70 terpenes in the cone oil. As can be seen, the most significant differences between both oils is the content of limonene, which constituted 47.15 g/100 g in the seed oil, while cone oil contained only 2.71 g/100 g of this monoterpene. What is more, sabinene is one of the main compounds in the cone oil (10.73 g/100 g), but it constituted only 0.23 g/100 g of the seed oil. Another determinant that distinguishes cone oil from seed oil is a higher content of oxygenated derivatives of monoterpenes, which constituted 9.23 g/100 g and 0.71 g/100 g, respectively. Among this group, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-pinocarveol, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol, myrthenol and verbenol, α-terpineol, cryptone and α-campholenal occurred in significantly higher concentrations in comparison with 
 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> seed oil. Probably due to the ligneous structure of cone scales and ability to produce resin the cone oil contained also a higher concentration of diterpenes, 2.82 g/100 g, while seed oil contained only traces of these chemicals.
