<p class="p">The second most abundant group characterizing the examined seed oil were sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (1.9 g/100 g), among which γ-cadinene (0.97 g/100 g), α-muurolene (0.20 g/100 g), and α-copaene (0.18 g/100 g) were the main compounds. This terpene group constituted from 5% to even 10% of the needle oil. Among them, δ- and γ-cadinene, valencene, and (
