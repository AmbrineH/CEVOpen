<p class="p">Opposite to the seed oil, the second main and most numerous group in the examined cone oil were oxygenated derivatives of monoterpenes (9.2 g/100 g). In this group predominant was terpinen-4-ol (1.9 g/100 g), myrtenol and verbenol (2.2 g/100 g), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-pinocarveol (1.4 g/100 g), as well as 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-verbenol (1.2 g/100 g). It is worth mentioning that the main oxygenated monoterpenes in the needle oil were bornyl acetate and Î±-terpineol, which dependently on population origin constituted even 20% and 7% of essential oil, respectively [
