<p class="p">The yield of cone essential oil ranged from 0.40% to 0.47% (average—0.44%). The yield of seed essential oil was twelve times higher than that of cone scales and was on the level of 5.43% (ranging from 5.38% to 5.54%). Seed oil was also characterized by very attractive forestry, resinous, fresh, citrus-like scent, opposite to less attractive, resinous, soil-like scent of cone oil, caused 
 <italic class="italic">inter alia</italic>, probably by a bigger amount of high boiling volatiles, like the diterpenes that are detected in cone oil. The yield of

Chromatographic and spectroscopic methods allowed us to identify 98 compounds in the examined essential oils, which constituted 92.3 g/100 g and 96.8 g/100 g of cone and seed oils, respectively. The structure of 13 of white fir volatiles were also confirmed by

It is important that the levorotatory form of limonene in the seed oil was in great majority (≥97%).
