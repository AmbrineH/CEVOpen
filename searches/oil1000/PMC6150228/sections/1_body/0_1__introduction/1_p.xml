 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic>, commonly known as the white fir, is a species native to the mountains of western North America (Sierra Nevada Mountains of southern Oregon and California, as well the southern Rocky Mountains). Variation between the two regions of 
 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> is sufficient to commonly recognize two varieties, i.e., var. 
 <italic class="italic">Iowiana</italic> (California white fir) and var. 
 <italic class="italic">concolor</italic> (Rocky Mountain white fir). Only the Rocky Mountain form of Concolor fir is suited for planting in other northern hemisphere regions [

This tree naturally occurs at elevations of 900–3400 m and grows to 25–60 m tall. The cones are 6–12 cm long and 4–4.5 cm broad, green or purple, with about 100–150 scales. The winged seeds are released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about six months after pollination. In Poland it is usually in September. 
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> generally lives from 300 to 400 years. Some trees have been known to live to even over 500 years. White fir is a preferred construction species because of its nail-holding ability, lightness in weight, and resistance to split, twist, and pitch. It is straight-grained, non-resinous, fine-textured, stiff, and strong. This fir species is widely planted in northern hemisphere as an ornamental tree in parks and larger gardens, and also cultivated as a Christmas tree [
