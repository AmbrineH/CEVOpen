 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> isolates (including essential oils) have been done. Due to essential oils, antibacterial, antifungal, and insecticidal activities, these plant isolates have been intensely tested and applied in the fields of pharmacology, medical and clinical microbiology, and food preservation. As it was found in many current scientific literature, the essential oils have also been shown to possess cytotoxic effects. The remarkable effectiveness exhibited by the essential oils may be interesting for example in the cosmetic industry or food processing, which, as is known, is increasingly directed to the use of so called green chemistry that is able to safeguard the high quality of products and the environment [
