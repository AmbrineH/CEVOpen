<p class="p">Summarizing, the seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> are a rich source of essential oil (5.4%) with a very pleasant forestry scent. The quantitative and qualitative compositions of examined seed and cone essential oils differ from each other, however the main volatiles belong to monoterpene group. In conclusion, our results indicate that the essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> seeds and cones have no toxic effect on human skin fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells when added to the cells at a low concentration (0–0.075 μL/mL and 0–1.0 μL/mL, respectively) and cultured for 24 h. The inhibiting activity of essential oils isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">A. concolor</italic> seeds and cones was mild, and this is certainly dependent on the presence of monoterpene hydrocarbons as a mine constituents of tested oils, but essential oils from these conifers may be a valuable addition to medicines and cosmetics with a gentle antibacterial action.
