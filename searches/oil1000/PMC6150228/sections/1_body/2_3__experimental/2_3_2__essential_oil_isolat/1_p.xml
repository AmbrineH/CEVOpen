<p class="p">Before hydrodistillation the fir seeds were crushed using simple mill. Essential oils from such crushed seeds and separately from cone scales were isolated by hydrodistillation for 4 h using a Clevenger-type glass apparatus. After that time, the amount of essential oils in apparatus did not rise, thus we choose 4 h as an appropriate time of seed essential oil isolation. Hydrodistillation was performed 14 times for cone scales and three times for seeds. The number of distillation was caused by huge amount of cone scales and less weight of seeds. Each hydrodistillation was conducted using 100â€“200 g of plant material.</p>
