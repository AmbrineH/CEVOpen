<p class="p">To isolate the volatiles of interest, the seed oil (34 g) was subjected to fractional distillation under reduced pressure. The residue, deprived of monoterpene hydrocarbons (1.32 g) was flash-chromatographed (FC) on silica gel 60 (0.040–0.063 mm, Merck, EM Science, NJ, USA) with hexane and increasing amounts of diethyl ether. The separation was monitored by TLC and GC-MS. Fourteen fractions (1–14) were obtained and analysed by GC-MS-FID. Structures of 13 volatiles from the following fractions were confirmed using 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy: 1: (157 mg) α-copaene (33%), α-cubebene (37%); 2: (690 mg) γ-cadinene (26%), δ-cadinene (31%); 7: (526 mg) bornyl acetate (82%); 9: (131 mg) terpinen-4-ol (24%), cubenol (39%); 10: (34 mg) τ-cadinol (51%); 11: (129 mg) 4-
