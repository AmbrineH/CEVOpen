<p class="p">The identification of compounds was based on a comparison of MS spectra with computer mass library NIST 2012, Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 8th edition, and MassFinder 4.1 along with the relative retention indices (RI, non-polar column). Identification was also based on the comparison of 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR spectra with literature data or a homemade NMR database. The identification of limonene, camphene, α-, and β-pinene enantiomers was based on (−)- and (+)-standards of these terpenes.
