<p class="p">The standard bacterial strains, i.e., the Gram-positive strains 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 43300, 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC 51299 (VanB), and 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecium</italic> VA sensitive ATCC 35667 and the Gram-negative strains 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 700603 were obtained from the collection of the Medical and Sanitary Microbiology Department, Medical University of Łódź (Łódź, Poland). The standard strains were cultivated in Columbia agar medium and were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in aerobic conditions. Bacterial suspensions with an optical density of 0.5 McFarland scale were prepared and analyzed with a BioMerieux densitometer (BioMerieux, Hamburg, Germany). The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated with the broth micro-dilution method [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-22-01880" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The essential oils and thymol (used as a positive control) were diluted in EtOH. These solutions were mixed with 100 μL of Mueller-Hinton broth to obtain concentrations from 11.5 to 32.5 μL/mL. The mixtures were then transferred to 96-well microliter plates. An inoculum (10 μL) per well was added to the broth with various oil concentrations. As a control of strain growth, one well was filled with broth without oils or thymol. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of oil or thymol, which inhibited the visible growth of bacteria after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C under aerobic conditions. The control media containing only EtOH at concentrations that were used for the dilutions of the oils did not inhibit the growth of the standard bacterial strains.
