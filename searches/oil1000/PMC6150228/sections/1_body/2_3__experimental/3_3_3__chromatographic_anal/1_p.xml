<p class="p">Essential oils, its enantiomers, were analysed by GC-MS-FID. The analyses were performed on a Trace GC Ultra coupled with DSQII mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA, USA). A simultaneous GC-FID and MS analysis was performed using a MS-FID splitter (SGE Analytical Science, Ringwood Victoria, Australia). Mass range was 33–550 amu, ion source-heating: 200 °C, ionization energy: 70 eV. One microliter of essential oil solution (80%

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) diluted in pentane:diethyl ether was injected in split mode at split ratios (50:1). Operating conditions: capillary column Rtx-1 MS (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm), and temperature program: 50 (3 min)–300 °C (30 min) at 4 °C/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 280 °C and 300 °C, respectively. Carrier gas was helium (constant pressure: 300 kPa). Resolution of (−) and (+) enantiomers of limonene, α- and β-pinene, camphene was performed on a Chirasil-Dex CB column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) having the following dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm df. Temperature program: 50 (3 min)–220 °C (30 min) at 4 °C/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 240 °C and 250 °C, respectively. Carrier gas was nitrogen at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
