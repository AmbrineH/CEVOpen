<p class="p">For the measurement of response factors, compounds determined in the volatile fraction of the oil were grouped, based on their moieties, into chemical classes (hydrocarbons, aldehydes, etc.); each class was sub-divided depending on the comprehensive structure of the compounds e.g., monoterpene, sesquiterpene, etc.). Standard compounds, each representing the chemical classes determined, were selected among those available in the laboratory. For a high level of reliability, when possible, more than one standard compound per class was considered.</p>
