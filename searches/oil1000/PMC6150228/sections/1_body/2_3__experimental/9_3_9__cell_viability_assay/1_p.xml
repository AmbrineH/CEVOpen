 <italic class="italic">H</italic>-tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd.; St. Louis, MO, USA). HMEC-1 (human microvascular endothelial cells) cells and human skin fibroblasts were cultured for 24 h with various concentrations: of essential oils or thymol and without tested oils or thymol (control groups) in 96-well plates. After incubation, 50 μL MTT (1 mg/mL, Sigma) was added and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. At the end of the experiment, the cells were exposed to 100 μL dimethyl sulphoxide, which enabled the release of the blue reaction product: formazan. The absorbance at 570 nm was read on a microplate reader and the results were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance measured in control cells. The results were submitted to statistical analysis using ANOVA, and post-hoc comparisons were performed using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The normal distribution of parameters was checked by means of the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the data was not normally distributed or the values of the variance (test 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>) were different, ANOVA with Kruscal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney’s 
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> test were used. All of the parameters were considered significantly different if 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The statistical data analysis was performed using Statgraphics 5.0 plus software (version 5.0 manuals, STSC Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).
