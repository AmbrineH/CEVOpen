<p class="p">Normal human skin fibroblasts (CRL-1474) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Washington, DC, USA), 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> incubator. Cells were counted in a hemocytometer and cultured at 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells per well in 2 mL of growth medium in 96 or 24 well plates (Costar, Washington, DC, USA). Cells reached confluence at day 6, and in most cases such cells were used for assays. The essential oils and thymol were diluted in ethanol. Ethanol was added also to the control. The final ethanol concentration did not exceed 0.1% throughout the study.
