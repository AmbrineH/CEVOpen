  <p class="p">Viability (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) and DNA synthesis (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) of human skin fibroblasts and viability (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of essential oils derived from 
   <italic class="italic">Abies concolor</italic> seeds (□) and cones (○). Cell viability and DNA synthesis are expressed as percentage when compared to untreated control cells and given as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments done in triplicates. Significant differences (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) are indicated by *.
