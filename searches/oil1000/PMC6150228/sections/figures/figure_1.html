 <p> Viability ( A) and DNA synthesis ( B) of human skin fibroblasts and viability ( C) of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of essential oils derived from Abies concolor seeds (□) and cones (○). Cell viability and DNA synthesis are expressed as percentage when compared to untreated control cells and given as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments done in triplicates. Significant differences ( p ≤ 0.05) are indicated by *. </p>
