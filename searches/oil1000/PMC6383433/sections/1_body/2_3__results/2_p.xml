 <italic class="italic"> H. scupense</italic>. This concentration is significantly lower than what was recorded with the other EO (3.125 - 6.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml). The eclosion rates of the eggs in all treatments were significantly different as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Note that thyme and rosemary EO are more inhibitors of eclosion than other EO such as those of river red gum and blue gum. At 24 hours, thyme EO proved to be the most larvicidal, whereas the least larvicidal was blue gum EO. On the 6th day, the most and the least larvicidal EO remained the same as those obtained in 24 h (
