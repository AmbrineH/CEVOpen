<p class="p">We found excellent acaricidal activity of several EO constituents that were evaluated against
 <italic class="italic"> H. scupense</italic> in this study. Our results indicate that these compounds may provide real alternatives to the current conventional acaricidal products, especially against resistant tick populations. However, further investigations are warranted including toxicological studies on nontarget species regarding the usefulness of these components for tick control.
