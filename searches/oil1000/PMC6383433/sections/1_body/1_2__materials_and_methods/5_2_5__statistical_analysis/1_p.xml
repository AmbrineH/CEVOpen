<p class="p">The results of mean oviposition rate, egg eclosion rate, reproduction efficiency, and reproduction inhibition for adult ticks (
 <italic class="italic">H. scupense</italic>) were subjected to nonparametric tests using the Kruskal Wallis test [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Estimated LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, 
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>, and 
 <sub class="sub">95</sub> of larvae of each EO were determined at 24 h and 6 days. Lethal concentration data were transformed according to Finney's probit analysis method [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The Tukey test was used to identify differences between mean values of the LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>, and LC
 <sub class="sub">95</sub> which were obtained at 24 h and after 6 days for each EO. All these statistical analyses were performed using the Social Science Statistics Software (SPSS) for Windows, version 20.0. [
