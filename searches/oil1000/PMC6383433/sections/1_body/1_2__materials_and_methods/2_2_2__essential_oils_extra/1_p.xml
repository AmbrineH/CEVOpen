<p class="p">Extraction of EO from plant parts was carried out by hydrodistillation for three hours using a Clevenger-type hydrodistillation apparatus. GC-MS analysis of the oils was performed on an HP-MS HP Model 6980 inert MSD (Agilent Technologies, USA), with HP-5MS column (30 × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m film thickness). Temperature of the injector was maintained at 280°C. Oven temperature was maintained at 60°C for 1 min and then increased to 280°C at 5°C/min and remained constant at this temperature for 8 min. Flow rate of the helium carrier was 1 ml/min and split mode 1/100 was used. Identification of components in the EO was accomplished by comparison of their Kovats index and GC mass fragmentation with those of Wiley Mass Spectral data (Agilent Technologies 7th edition, Inc.) and NIST 05 MS library data. Each analysis was executed in duplicate.
