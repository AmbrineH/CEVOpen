 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] to evaluate the larvicidal activity of the EO. Approximately 200 eggs (0.01 g) were transferred to a 2.5 ml open-end syringe whose plunger was withdrawn to the line of 2 ml. The syringe was then sealed with a TNT fabric and incubated at 27°C with 90% RH in darkness. Bioassays started 14 days after eclosion.
