<p class="p">Essential oils were serially diluted in 2% Tween 80 to obtain ten concentrations ranging from 12.5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml to 0.024 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml. Larvae were exposed to 2 ml of a concentration per syringe replicated twice. Larvae were exposed to each concentration for 5 min. Mortality in one syringe was recorded at 24 h, while larval mortality in the second syringe was recorded at 6 days. Each bioassay was repeated three times. After removing the TNT parts and emptying the syringes contents, the number of the living and dead larvae was counted in both syringes incubated at 24 h and 6 days. Control groups were handled similarly and were exposed to 2% Tween 80 solution only.
