 <p class="p">The present study aimed to investigate the acaricidal properties of six essential oils. They were extracted from some plant species (
  <italic class="italic">Lamiaceae</italic> and
  <italic class="italic"> Myrtaceae</italic>) using the technique of hydrodistillation with the Clevenger apparatus. The chemical compositions of the essential oils under study were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC-MS). An Adult Immersion Test (AIT) and a Larval Immersion Test (LIT) were used to evaluate the acaricidal activity of these essential oils against the adults and larvae of
  <italic class="italic"> Hyalomma scupense</italic>. GC-MS analysis showed the major constituents of each essential oil: 25.49% of 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujone (lavender); 46.82% of carvacrol (oregano); 78.78% of carvacrol (thyme); 40.27% of 1,8-cineole (blue gum); 17.45% of p-cymene (river red gum); and 26.96% of 1,8-cineole (rosemary). The biotests on the essential oils revealed that they inhibit the reproduction of
  <italic class="italic"> H. scupense</italic> engorged females at a rate of 100 % with doses of 0.781 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml of rosemary, 1.562 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml of thyme, 3.125 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml of lavender and oregano, and 6.250 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml of blue gum and river red gum. After a treatment that lasted for 24 hours, essential oils showed a larvicidal activity with respective values of lethal concentrations (LC): LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>, LC
  <sub class="sub">90</sub>, and LC
  <sub class="sub">95</sub> (0.058, 0.358, and 0.600 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for thyme; 0.108, 0.495, and 0.761 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for rosemary; 0.131, 0.982, and 1.740 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for oregano; 0.155, 2.387, and 5.183 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for blue gum; 0.207, 1.653, and 2.978 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for river red gum; and 0.253, 2.212, and 4.092 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l/ml for lavender). This is the first report on the acaricidal activity of these essential oils against
  <italic class="italic"> H. scupense.</italic> The results obtained showed that the essential oils with chemotype carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujone, and p-cymene are highly acaricidal, and they can be used for ticks control. However, further studies on their toxicity in nontarget organisms are required.
