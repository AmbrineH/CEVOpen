<p class="p">Under the presumption that the sulfur in ENSDs is ultimately derived from sulfate, a microbiological answer to this geological conundrum could involve several concepts. One is an alternative, or ‘leaky,’ dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway that yields sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation states, which can subsequently be converted to native sulfur. Another could utilize ‘non-classical’ oxidants and oxidation pathways for the oxidation of sulfide to native sulfur. Any postulated scenario has to be energetically feasible. If the proposed process argues for a shift from one metabolic pathway to another, there should be a reason for what could have triggered such a shift. Ideally, there should also be evidence from experiments or the environment that point to the possible existence of the hypothesized process.</p>
