<p class="p">The discussion above shows that if O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> were the oxidant in native sulfur deposits, several biogeochemical coincidences are required. For example, well-timed alternating cycles of abundant O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with phases of low supply, where the sulfide can accumulate, have been postulated for the Middle Miocene strata-bound sulfur deposits of northern Iraq (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jassim et al., 1999</xref>), or a ‘pipe-to-chimney-like’ saline groundwater flow into the Castile evaporite in the Rustler Springs sulfur district, Texas (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kirkland, 2014</xref>). Moreover, geochemical data imply that supply of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the sites where native sulfur deposits were formed was limited, and that for Challenger Knoll – the rare case where a site with potentially active sulfur generation was accessed – O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was found to be absent. While explanations that include O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as critical agent in the formation of native sulfur deposits may be plausible for some sites, following the law of parsimony (Occam’s razor), we pose the question: are there not simpler – and less coincidental – alternatives for the genesis of native sulfur deposits?
