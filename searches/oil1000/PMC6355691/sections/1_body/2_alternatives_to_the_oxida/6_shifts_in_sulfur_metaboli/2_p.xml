<p class="p">Release of intermediates as a stress response has indeed been observed for dissimilatory sulfate reduction. This process operates over several steps, including intermediates such as adenosine phosphosulfate (APS), and sulfite (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Akagi, 1995</xref>). Sulfite is reduced by the enzyme DsrAB, with the sulfite-derived sulfur coupling to DsrC, forming a protein-based trisulfide, which can then be reduced to reduced DsrC and sulfide (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). This last step is of particular importance for dissimilatory sulfate reduction since it couples the four-electron reduction of DsrC to energy conservation (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). In absence of functional DsrC but presence of DsrAB, the products of sulfate reduction can be trithionate, thiosulfate, and sulfide, however, DsrC turns out to be essential for sulfate reduction (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Probably, the energy gained from this last step ties into the energetically costly activation of the sulfate molecule to APS, which could explain why dissimilatory sulfate reduction usually does not release sulfur intermediates. Nevertheless, it is known that under stressed conditions, such as maintenance metabolism in a retenostat or sulfite reduction by washed cells, thiosulfate and tetrathionate can be released by sulfate-reducing bacteria (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>). Such a leakiness of dissimilatory sulfate reduction as a stress response to sulfate-saturated pore fluids coupled with low availability of an electron donor has been proposed to explain the formation of native sulfur nodules in the Lisan Formation, Israel (
