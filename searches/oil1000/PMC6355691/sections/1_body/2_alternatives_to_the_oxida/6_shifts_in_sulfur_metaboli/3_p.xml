<p class="p">In the formation of ENSDs – particularly if they function as systems with rather sluggish fluid exchange – there are two obvious stress factors. The first factor is build-up of high levels of sulfide (sulfide stress). Following Le Chatelier’s principle this renders additional sulfide production energetically less favorable, but more importantly, at high levels, sulfide becomes toxic to organisms. Because ENSDs form in the vicinity of evaporite deposits, which offer vast quantities of highly soluble salts, the second stress factor is high concentrations of ions (salt stress).</p>
