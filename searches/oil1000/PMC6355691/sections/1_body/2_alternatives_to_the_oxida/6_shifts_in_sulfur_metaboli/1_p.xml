<p class="p">There are several reasons why metabolic processes can yield a product that is commonly absent. One cause is a change in the environmental conditions that results in an inactive process becoming more energy yielding than the previously prevailing one. A second option is a response to environmental stress, which may cause a metabolic process to no longer function optimally (but still energetically favorably), thereby releasing intermediates from its pathway. A third option constitutes a trade-off situation: to cope with unfavorable environmental conditions, organisms shift from a mechanism that overall provides the highest energy yield, but also leads to poor environmental conditions to a process with lower energy yield that offers the advantage that the reaction products do not exacerbate the unfavorable conditions.</p>
