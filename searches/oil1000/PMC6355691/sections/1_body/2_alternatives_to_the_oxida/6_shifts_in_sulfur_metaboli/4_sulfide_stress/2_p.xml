<p class="p">Similar to sulfate-reducing bacteria, ANME that are involved in sulfate-driven AOM must be tolerant to sulfide. In some incubation experiments, AOM activity stopped at sulfide concentrations as low as 2.1 mM. Yet, this may have been caused by selection of weakly tolerant AOM cultures by sulfide removal during the culture enrichment (

 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> incubations operate at much higher sulfide concentrations, up to 14 mM (

 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wegener et al., 2016</xref>). Sulfide inhibition of AOM was observed for low sulfate concentrations (4 mM) and high sulfide concentrations (3–4 mM), but not with high sulfate (21 mM) and high sulfide (3–4 mM) concentrations, which implies that thermodynamics (energy yield) impact the sulfide tolerance of AOM (
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Timmers et al., 2015</xref>). Due to advection in methane seep environments, sulfate and methane availability is higher than in sulfate-methane transition zones in marine sediments that are governed by diffusion. Thus, AOM in seep environments is expected to show a higher sulfide tolerance, an interpretation that is supported by the observation of high sulfide concentrations of 10–15 mM in seep settings (

 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Milucka et al., 2012</xref>), the following questions arise: could ANME oxidize the toxic sulfide to native sulfur as a coping strategy, or alternatively, could this oxidation happen spontaneously once sulfide enters ANME cells, and what in either case would the electron acceptor be for such a reaction? A possibility is that sulfate-reducing bacteria, as in the case of methane oxidation by ANME (

As a net reaction, this process corresponds to the comproportionation of sulfide and sulfate to form native sulfur, whereby the weakly exergonic AOM reaction may have to offset a slight potential energy loss by the comproportionation reaction under environmental conditions.
