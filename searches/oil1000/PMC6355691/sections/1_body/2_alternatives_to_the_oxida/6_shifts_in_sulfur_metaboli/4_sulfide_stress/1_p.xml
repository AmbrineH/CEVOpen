<p class="p">In aqueous solutions at circum-neutral pH, sulfide exists in approximately equal amounts as dissolved hydrogen sulfide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S) and bisulfide ion (HS
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>). In natural environments, sulfide concentrations can reach hypersulfidic levels, such as 10 mM in cool-water carbonate sediments, (
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wortmann et al., 2001</xref>) or 16 mM in hypersaline waters of the Urania Deep (
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van der Wielen et al., 2005</xref>). Sulfide anions are as toxic as cyanide because they share the ability to coordinate and precipitate metal cations that are crucial for metabolism (for a review, see 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beauchamp et al., 1984</xref>). A contributing factor to the toxicity of sulfide is the ability of the neutrally charged H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S to easily diffuse through cell membranes without facilitation of membrane channels (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barton et al., 2014</xref>). Sulfide is also toxic to the sulfate-reducing bacteria themselves. Most can tolerate sulfide concentrations of 10 mM and higher. However, sulfide stress results in community shifts, and lower growth and sulfate reduction rates (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eckert et al., 2011</xref>). In sulfide-stress experiments with 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrio vulgaris</italic> Hildenborough, genes involved in energy production and conservation were found to be mostly downregulated under high sulfide conditions, with 
 <italic class="italic">dsrD</italic> being the most affected gene of the entire genome (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caffrey and Voordouw, 2010</xref>). It has been proposed that the DsrD protein plays a role in transcription or translation of genes for enzymes catalyzing dissimilatory sulfite reduction (
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mizuno et al., 2003</xref>), which resonates with the finding that in absence of functional DsrC but presence of DsrAB, the products of sulfate reduction can be trithionate, thiosulfate, and sulfide (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, these findings imply that sulfate-reducing bacteria are affected by sulfide stress, which might result in a change in their energy metabolism or induce ‘leakiness’ with regards to sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation state. Sulfide toxicity also impacts organisms that can simultaneously perform methanogenesis and native sulfur reduction to sulfide. When grown with hydrogen and sulfur, methanogenesis by 
 <italic class="italic">Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus</italic> ended before hydrogen sulfide production, resulting in cells lysis caused by sulfide toxicity (
