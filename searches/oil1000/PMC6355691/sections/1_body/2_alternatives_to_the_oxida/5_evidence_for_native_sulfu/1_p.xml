<p class="p">Direct evidence for the formation of native sulfur in the absence of a classical oxidant or light is scarce. The simplest explanation for this would be that such processes do not exist. Alternatively, it is likely that native sulfur formation in the absence of a classical oxidant would not be detected, as other sulfur cycling processes would obscure it. For example, neo-formed native sulfur could be removed or obscured by the addition of native sulfur that is derived from sulfide oxidation by a classical oxidant. The phenomenon that hidden processes in the sulfur cycle are difficult to detect is not uncommon and has been referred to as cryptic sulfur cycling (

Despite these constraints, there are two instances in which there is indication that native sulfur formation takes place in the absence of a classical oxidant, the anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction (AOM), and sulfur cycling in the sulfidic, hypersaline Urania deep-sea basin.
