<p class="p">Somewhat more circumstantial evidence comes from the Urania deep-sea basin. In the most saline layers of the basin, methanogenesis greatly exceeds sulfate reduction, pointing to methylated compounds, which cannot be utilized by sulfate-reducing bacteria as a substrate (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Borin et al., 2009</xref>). Unless these compounds with intermediate oxidation state are derived from oxidative sulfur cycling at the interface to oxic water, there would need to be a process within the sulfidic water body that supplies them. The co-occurrence of methanogenesis and native sulfur reduction – and simultaneous competition between these processes – in methanogens implies that there are close evolutionary relationships between these pathways (
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stetter and Gaag, 1983</xref>), which could be exploited in the coupling of methanogenesis and native sulfur production. Thus, the question becomes: what could trigger the formation of zero-valent sulfur in hypersaline, sulfidic environments, and is there a link to carbon cycling via methanogenesis?
