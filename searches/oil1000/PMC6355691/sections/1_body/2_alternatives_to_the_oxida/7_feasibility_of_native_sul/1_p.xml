<p class="p">It is critical to assess whether the proposed mechanisms for the genesis of native sulfur deposits from hydrocarbons and gypsum or anhydrite in the absence of classical oxidants is thermodynamically favorable. If this prerequisite is not a given for a considered mechanism, one has to invoke a coupling to another thermodynamically favorable process that would make the overall process feasible. Once native sulfur is formed and precipitated as a solid, the slow kinetics of sulfur dissolution may become a critical factor in its preservation. This could also be important when native sulfur is formed as an intermediate of a process as long as this intermediate is allowed to accumulate to a degree where it precipitates while the overall process remains thermodynamically feasible. The latter could be the case for organismsâ€™ stress response, where survival becomes more important than energy gain maximization. Below, we show that there are numerous reactions that could yield native sulfur as a product. The proposed mechanisms do not represent individual pathways but overall net reactions, which may be carried out by individual or consortia of organisms. As such, the presented equations and thermodynamics only demonstrate the potential for the existence of a process, but do not give any indication about its actual presence.</p>
