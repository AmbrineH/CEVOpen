<p class="p">Based on the observation that hypersaline, sulfidic environments such as the Urania deep-sea basin may be a location where sulfur with intermediate oxidation state is produced, it is interesting to explore the thermodynamics of such coupled sulfur-carbon cycling. Methylated substrates such as methanol, which is derived from lignin and pectin degradation (
