<p class="p">which yields the same net reaction as acetoclastic methanogenesis (Eq. 7). At high carbon dioxide concentrations in oil reservoirs, acetoclastic methanogenesis appears to dominate over syntrophic methanogenesis (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mayumi et al., 2013</xref>). Syntrophic methanogenesis appears to be the dominant acetate degradation pathway once sulfate is depleted beneath the seabed (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and methanogenesis (Eq. 7) are likely the reasons why these reactions become inhibited under salt stress (

Interestingly, the reaction for methanogenesis (Eq. 7) can be combined with carbon dioxide reduction to methane coupled to the oxidation of sulfide to native sulfur (Eq. 4), yielding exergonic reactions for native sulfur generation combined with methanogenesis with acetate as reactant:
