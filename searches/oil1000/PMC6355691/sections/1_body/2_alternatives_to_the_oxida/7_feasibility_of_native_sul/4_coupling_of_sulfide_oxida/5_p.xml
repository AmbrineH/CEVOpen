<p class="p">This reaction is strongly pH dependent, as well as dependent on the activities of the substrates and products of the reaction. To our knowledge, little research has been carried out in regard to the feasibility of this reaction. A coupling to the precipitation of carbonate minerals, which is promoted by the availability of calcium ions from the dissolution of calcium sulfate minerals, could provide a driving force for this process because the removal of carbonate ions is compensated by the genesis of CO
