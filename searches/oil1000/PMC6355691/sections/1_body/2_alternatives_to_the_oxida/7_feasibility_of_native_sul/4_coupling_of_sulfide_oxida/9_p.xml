<p class="p">This reaction could work in concert with sulfide production by methanotrophic sulfate reduction (AOM) coupled to the transformation of gypsum into carbonates (Eq. T2.5, Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). If the two reactions are coupled (yielding Eq. T2.6, Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), build-up of methane would not be observed because methane consumption coupled to sulfate reduction could out-pace methane production coupled to sulfide oxidation (Eq. 6), establishing a cryptic carbon cycle via methanogenesis.
