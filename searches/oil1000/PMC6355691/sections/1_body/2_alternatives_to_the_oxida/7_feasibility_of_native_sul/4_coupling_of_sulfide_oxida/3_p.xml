<p class="p">This reaction is strongly endergonic, i.e., it requires energy, and is carried out by anoxygenic phototrophs that oxidize sulfide to native sulfur as a means to fix carbon (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ehrlich and Newman, 2009</xref>) if a yet unknown other energy source could substitute for light. It is important to notice that another reaction following the same pattern of coupling carbon dioxide reduction to sulfide oxidation is energetically more feasible in the absence of light; the conversion to methane:
