<p class="p">The conversion of sulfide and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into ammonium and native sulfur is endergonic at standard conditions at neutral pH. For the genesis of native sulfur via N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> reduction to ammonium, a low pH is favorable. Addition of the two equations (Eq. 18 and 19) yields the equation for the genesis of native sulfur from ammonium and sulfate (Eqs. 17). Crude oil contains nitrogen as a component of organic molecules (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schimmelmann and Lis, 2010</xref>). Thus, from a quantitative perspective, it is not certain if coupled nitrogen-sulfur cycling could be responsible for the formation of ENSDs. Aside from this caveat, it is noteworthy that the reactions involving the genesis or consumption of ammonium (a weak acid) can strongly impact the pH (Eqs. 17â€“19). This characteristic could serve as a means to maintain the pH of the environment in a favorable range. In a sulfide-stressed setting, where the sulfide speciation is critical because neutrally charged H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S easily diffuses through cell membranes (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barton et al., 2014</xref>), genesis of native sulfur and shifting the pH to higher values (Eq. 19, and to a lesser degree Eq. 17) could be an effective strategy to cope with sulfide stress.
