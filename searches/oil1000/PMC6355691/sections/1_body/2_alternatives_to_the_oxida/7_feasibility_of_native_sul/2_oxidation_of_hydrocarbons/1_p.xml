<p class="p">Sulfate reduction to native sulfur and concomitant conversion of gypsum into calcite as a bulk process is energetically favorable (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Examples calculated with glucose, acetate, and methane as organic substrates for environmental conditions demonstrate that genesis of native sulfur is (1) thermodynamically feasible, (2) with regards to energetic yield close, and in some cases superior to the genesis of sulfide, and (3) strongly pH-dependent, with low pH making native sulfur formation more attractive than sulfide generation (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
