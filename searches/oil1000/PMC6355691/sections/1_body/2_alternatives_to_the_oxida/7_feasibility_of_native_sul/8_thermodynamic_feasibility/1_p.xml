<p class="p">Genesis of native sulfur is thermodynamically feasible when linked to hydrocarbon (including methane) oxidation, sulfur comproportionation, methanogenesis, and coupling to nitrogen cycling. Considering the generally low energy yields, it is evident that 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> conditions, particularly the actual activities and fugacities of the compounds involved in the reactions are decisive if individual reactions are favorable. Nevertheless, from the wide variety of potential processes, it follows that there is no thermodynamic argument that would exclude genesis of native sulfur in an anoxic setting as a viable option.
