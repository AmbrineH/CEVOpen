<p class="p">Two reactions with inorganic compounds have been invoked for the genesis of native sulfur in epigenetic deposits. The first concept proposes a redox reaction that essentially does the opposite of a sulfur disproportionation reaction (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Feely and Kulp, 1957</xref>) by combining a sulfur compound with a positive and a sulfur compound with a negative oxidation state to form zero-valent sulfur. This mechanism is referred to as synproportionation or comproportionation and can be described as the reaction between hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid:
