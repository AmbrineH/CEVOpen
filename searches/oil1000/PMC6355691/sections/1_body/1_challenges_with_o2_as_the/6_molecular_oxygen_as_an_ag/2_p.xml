<p class="p">Yet, since the late 1980s, the concept that only aerobic microorganisms can decompose hydrocarbons has dramatically changed (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). An increasing number of microorganisms were identified that have the ability to utilize saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons as growth substrates under strictly anoxic conditions, and sulfate-reducing bacteria were shown to use a much broader range of substrates from oil and gas reservoirs than previously assumed (

The recent finding that butane-oxidizing archaea function in a consortium with sulfate-reducing bacteria further underlines that anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction can take advantage of a broad range of substrates (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Laso-PÃ©rez et al., 2016</xref>). These findings do not only apply to incubation studies but are corroborated by biomarker studies. Biomarkers that are attributed to anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and associated sulfate-reducing bacteria, who carry out sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), were found in carbonates associated with native sulfur deposits in Sicily (
 <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ziegenbalg et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, biomarker evidence for a microbial community dominated by sulfate-reducing bacteria that is capable of using petroleum hydrocarbons to reduce gypsum and produce carbonates was found in diagenetic carbonates associated with native sulfur deposits from the Gulf of Suez (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aloisi et al., 2013</xref>). These findings led to the conclusion that O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is not needed for the coupling of oil and gas degradation to microbial sulfate reduction, and by extension, imply that O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> may not be available for the oxidation of sulfide to native sulfur.
