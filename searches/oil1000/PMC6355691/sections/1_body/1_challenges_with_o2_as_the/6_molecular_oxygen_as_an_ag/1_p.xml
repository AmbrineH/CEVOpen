<p class="p">Evaporite deposits dominantly consist of carbonates, sulfates, and sodium chloride. Iron or manganese are rare constituents, as are nitrate salts due to their high solubility. From this follows that other than sulfate, evaporite rocks contain few compounds that could serve as oxidants for hydrocarbons or sulfide. Until the late 1980s, little evidence was available that anaerobic microorganisms degraded hydrocarbons. It was well established that aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons by O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, acting as a strong oxidant, was directly involved in overcoming the chemical sluggishness of hydrocarbon oxidation (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jobson et al., 1979</xref>), such as organic acids, this information led to the conclusion that “sulfate reducers are anaerobes but typically depend on aerobic bacteria to create suitably biodegraded hydrocarbon substrates” (Figure

 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren, 2006</xref>) and that meteoric water supplies the bulk of dissolved oxygen, whereas formation fluids supply oil or methane for the genesis of calcitic caprocks on salt diapirs (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> needed to be available for the degradation of oil, it was conceivable that O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> would also be available for the oxidation of sulfide to native sulfur, while acknowledging that sulfate-reducing bacteria, which produce the sulfide, are strict anaerobes (
