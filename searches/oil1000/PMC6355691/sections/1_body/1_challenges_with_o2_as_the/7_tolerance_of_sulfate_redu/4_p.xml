<p class="p">An alternative to the above scenario is the spatial or temporal separation of microbial sulfate reduction from sulfide oxidation. Sulfide is allowed to accumulate 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> during a period where hydrocarbons are available for sulfate reduction with no O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> supply, followed by a phase where O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is present but no hydrocarbons are available, allowing sulfide to be oxidized to native sulfur. Such a separation of sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation can also be achieved by migration of sulfide to a location where O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is available. The latter scenario requires a stratified water body, whereas the former relies on episodic changes in fluid supply (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jassim et al., 1999</xref>), which may be tied to shifts in the groundwater table due to seasonal changes, or in coastal areas, due to sea level fluctuations or changes in seepage of oil into the caprock system, triggering changes in the location of the interface between groundwater and captured hydrocarbons (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). One implication of these scenarios is that carbonate precipitation, which is tied to hydrocarbon oxidation, and native sulfur accumulation, can be temporally or spatially separate.
