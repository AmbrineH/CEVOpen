<p class="p">The discussion of (1) the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-tolerance of sulfate-reducing microbes, (2) microniches to separate sulfur oxidation from reduction, and (3) competition for O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in hydrocarbon oxidation demonstrates that presence of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> does not 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> exclude the formation of native sulfur and that it is likely such systems do exist. However, it shows that if supply with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is critical for the genesis of ENSDs, favorable circumstances need to coincide as both excess or dearth in O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can be problematic.
