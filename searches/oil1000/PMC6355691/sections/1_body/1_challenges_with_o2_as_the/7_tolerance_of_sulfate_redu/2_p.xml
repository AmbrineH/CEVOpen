<p class="p">This gives rise to the question of how the supply with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can be regulated such that the sulfate-reducing microbes are not negatively affected? In shallow water including reefal environments, sulfate-reducing organisms can thrive within millimeters of an oxic-anoxic interface (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fike et al., 2008</xref>), and biomarker and isotopic fingerprints of this process, occurring in presumably oxic environments with only anoxic micro-niches present, can be preserved in the geologic record (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gischler et al., 2017a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). Likely, the steep chemical gradients are maintained by extracellular polymeric substances, for example in biofilms, which limit the exchange of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> between oxidizing and reducing microenvironments. However, formation of biofilms may not be favored in epigenetic settings due to lack of pore space and no fossilized biofilms are reported from these subsurface environments. Lacking the protection of biofilms, sulfate-reducing bacteria can be exposed to O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> more easily.
