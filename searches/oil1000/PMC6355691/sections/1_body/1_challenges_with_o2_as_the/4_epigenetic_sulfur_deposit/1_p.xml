<p class="p">Evaporite-rich sedimentary rocks form in highly saline waters in arid continental settings or in ocean margin basins with high evaporation rates and limited water exchange with the global ocean. Such water bodies tend to become stratified due to density contrasts of highly saline bottom waters and fresher surface waters. Combined with the fact that O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solubility decreases with increased salinity, such depositional settings are prone to become anoxic, which in addition to the precipitation of evaporite minerals, can lead to the deposition of organic carbon-rich sediments and to the formation of syngenetic native sulfur deposits through the activity of sulfate-reducing organisms (e.g.,
