<p class="p">Based on these observations, the question arises: could ENSDs be formed from sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation state and elemental sulfur that accumulated during the deposition and early diagenesis of the evaporites? While a contribution of these sources cannot be excluded, several lines of evidence indicate that they cannot replace reduction of sulfate from gypsum and anhydrite as the primary sulfur source due to the following reasons. (1) Syngenetic sulfur deposits are typically out-sized by bioepigenetic sulfur deposits, which accounted for more than 98% of the world sulfur production with one third being from caprock and almost two thirds from stratabound deposits (
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ruckmick et al., 1979</xref>), indicating numerous syngenetic sulfur deposits would have to be recycled to obtain ENSDs. (2) Diagenetically formed tourmaline minerals in salt domes indicate that despite the fact that evaporite deposits can host organic-rich source rocks (e.g., the evaporitic Middle Pennsylvanian Paradox Formation in Utah and Colorado; 
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nuccio and Condon, 1996</xref>), the salt bodies themselves are likely not reduced (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Henry et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Henry and Dutrow, 2012</xref>). This confines potential accumulations of sulfur with intermediate oxidation states to these isolated bodies. (3) The typical paragenesis of carbonate and native sulfur minerals in epigenetic and syngenetic native sulfur deposits indicates that the two phases are precipitated in temporal proximity to each other, likely due to the coupling of sulfur and carbon cycling. If ENSDs were the result of a remobilization of sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation state, a simultaneous formation may no longer be required â€“ however, it is typically observed. (4) Carbonates in syngenetic native sulfur deposits tend to be 
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O-enriched because the water from which the carbonates precipitate is isotopically heavy due to evaporation. In contrast, carbonates in ENSDs are typically 
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O depleted because the associated brines are isotopically light. Thus, considering that there would not be enough sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation state and that it is difficult to explain the late-stage paragenesis of native sulfur and carbonates as a result of remobilization, it follows that ENSDs are likely derived from sulfate minerals rather than reduced sulfur species generated in an early depositional environment.
