<p class="p">To the best of our knowledge, Challenger Knoll, located in the Central Gulf of Mexico, is the only ENSD that has been accessed by scientific drilling and is a prime example of sulfur formation where little argument for the presence of O

However, the pore water chloride profiles showed fluctuations that indicated salt dissolution (increase in chloride) as well as addition of water from the dissolution of gypsum and oxidation of hydrocarbons (decrease in chloride). No evidence for entrainment of seawater or diffusion of O
