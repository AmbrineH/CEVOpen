<p class="p">Whereas overabundance of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> could impede sulfide generation and lead to the oxidation of native sulfur, insufficient supply with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> may result in the escape of sulfide and absence of native sulfur. Molecular oxygen in the subsurface can move by diffusion or advection, but because O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> diffusion on a 100m to km scale is exceedingly slow (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">RÃ¸y et al., 2012</xref>), advective transport is essential. Sustained fluid flow through the rocks adjacent to the native sulfur body can be driven by topographic differences (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>), dewatering of clay minerals or gypsum at depth, or density gradients caused by differences in salinity and/or temperature resulting in the establishment of convection cells (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hanor, 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thornton and Wilson, 2007</xref>). The fluids can range from meteoric to highly saline basinal brines (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hanor, 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kharaka and Hanor, 2014</xref>). Systems in which ENSDs form cannot be closed to fluid exchange since there must be a supply of hydrocarbons and, in the case of salt diapirs, salt must be removed via dissolution. If O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is supplied continuously or episodically, these fluxes must contribute to the transport of other solutes as well. Therefore, carbon, oxygen, and sulfur isotope mass balances have the potential to reveal if the flow of fluids was ample or limited.
