<p class="p">In contrast to the three carbon sources, there is typically only one major sulfur source in ENSDs – sulfate from evaporite minerals. These sulfates tend to have a fairly uniform sulfur isotope composition (δ
 <sup class="sup">34</sup>S) because they were formed from a large seawater sulfate pool and precipitation of sulfate minerals is associated with a small isotope fractionation (

 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pichat et al., 2017</xref>). The components of the sulfur cycle fall into five basic categories: (1) original sulfate in gypsum or anhydrite, (2) residual sulfate that has been exposed to microbial sulfate reduction, (3) sulfide minerals, (4) sulfurized organic compounds, and (5) native sulfur. In the absence of suitable cations, such as iron, no sulfide minerals (i.e., pyrite) are formed. If sulfurization of oil from its reaction with hydrogen sulfide can be ignored, the system reduces to three main categories. Residual sulfate can precipitate in secondary minerals: anhydrite or gypsum, celestine (SrSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), barite (BaSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) or as carbonate associated sulfate (CAS) in authigenic carbonates (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). The sulfur isotope systematics of native sulfur deposits show elemental sulfur is isotopically lighter and the residual sulfates isotopically heavier than the original evaporite minerals. Typically, the range in δ
 <sup class="sup">34</sup>S of the native sulfur is smaller than that of residual sulfates, and the difference in isotope composition between native sulfur and the original sulfate is much smaller than that between original and residual sulfate (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>). Classically, such signatures have been interpreted as the result of microbial sulfate reduction in a closed system. Sulfate-reducing bacteria preferentially produce sulfide that is depleted in 
 <sup class="sup">34</sup>S relative to sulfate, thereby enriching the residual sulfate in 
 <sup class="sup">34</sup>S. With continuing consumption of the remaining sulfate, the δ
 <sup class="sup">34</sup>S value of residual sulfate becomes exponentially heavier, whereas the accumulated sulfide approaches the δ
 <sup class="sup">34</sup>S value of the original sulfate, a process that can be modeled as closed system Rayleigh distillation (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Feely and Kulp, 1957</xref>) are attributed to dissimilatory sulfate reduction, these trends match the observations of the sulfur isotope patterns of ENSDs fairly well (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>). This led to the conclusion that the inhomogeneous, heavy isotope signatures of sulfate remaining in the calcite cap rock represents residues from bacterial sulfate reduction (
