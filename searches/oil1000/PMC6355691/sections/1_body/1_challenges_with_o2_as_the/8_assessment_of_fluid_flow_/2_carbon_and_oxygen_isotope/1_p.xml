<p class="p">The oxygen isotope composition (δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O) of carbonates can provide information about the fluids from which they precipitated, whereas their carbon isotope composition (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C) provides information about the carbon source. For example, a δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O value of 0.05‰ and a δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C value of −25.30‰ (vs. PDB-I;

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis and Bray, 1969</xref>). The carbon isotope value indicates that oil was the dominant carbon source, as it is very similar to oil found in Challenger Knoll (

 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C close to 0‰), oil (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C as low as −30‰), and methane (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C as low as approximately −100‰), makes it difficult to establish a precise mass balance between the different pools and to quantify the fluxes involved (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). Still, low δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values indicate limited supply of oxygenated water, as such waters would contribute isotopically heavy carbon.
