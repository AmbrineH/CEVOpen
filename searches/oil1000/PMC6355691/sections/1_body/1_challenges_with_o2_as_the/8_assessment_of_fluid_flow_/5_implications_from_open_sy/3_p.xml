<p class="p">In summary, the assessment of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur isotope mass balances for ENSDs demonstrates that fluid flow must have been sluggish. This implies that supply with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> must have been insufficient for the genesis of the native sulfur at these sites, and that conditions at the time of the formation of native sulfur were probably hypersulfidic. In addition, the carbon isotope signature of the carbonates shows that oil and methane have served as electron donors for sulfate reduction, implying that there is diversity in the microbial communities that carry out the overall process.
