<p class="p">There are several reasons why a Rayleigh distillation model may not be appropriate to interpret data from ENSDs. The first is that in proximity to massive gypsum or anhydrite deposits, there is always ample supply of sulfate, thus the system is not closed with respect to sulfate input. Second, if hydrocarbons, and potentially oxygenated water enter the system, the fluids they replace would be expected to entrain produced sulfide and residual sulfate, once more making a closed system argument difficult to uphold. Last, for a closed-system Rayleigh isotope fractionation, the maximum sulfur isotope offsets observed between original and residual sulfate as well as native sulfur appears to be too small. Isotope fractionation between sulfate and sulfide during sulfate reduction can be as large as 75‰, particularly if the overall energy yield for the sulfate-reducing organisms is low, as it is likely for oil-derived compounds (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deusner et al., 2014</xref>). This begs the question, why, at least for some ENSDs, is the sulfur isotope offset between native sulfur and the original sulfate not much larger for an initial stage of Rayleigh distillation, and also much larger between original and residual sulfate at a late stage? If one excludes thermochemical sulfate reduction at low temperatures (70°C) as a means to explain the minimal isotope offset between sulfide and original sulfate, which was an option proposed for West Huckberry dome (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McManus and Hanor, 1993</xref>), an answer must be found that accommodates the observed moderate degree of sulfur isotope fractionation, continuous supply of sulfate from gypsum or anhydrite dissolution, and some degree of transport of solutes out of the system.
