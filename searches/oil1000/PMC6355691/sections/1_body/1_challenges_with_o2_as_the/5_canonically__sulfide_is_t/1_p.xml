<p class="p">There is a plethora of biological sulfur transformations, which includes sulfur reduction, oxidation, disproportionation and comproportionation reactions (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wasmund et al., 2017</xref>). Many of these reactions may create zero-valent sulfur as an intermediate or final product and it is likely that some of these processes have not been discovered yet, a fact that has been referred to as ‘cryptic sulfur cycling’ (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>). Microorganisms have been shown to use intermediate sulfur species, such as thiosulfate, to produce native sulfur (Figure

 <italic class="italic">Clostridium thermosulfurogenes</italic>, which produces native sulfur from thiosulfate while fermenting carbohydrates to ethanol, molecular hydrogen, carbon dioxide, acetate, lactate, methanol, and isopropanol (
