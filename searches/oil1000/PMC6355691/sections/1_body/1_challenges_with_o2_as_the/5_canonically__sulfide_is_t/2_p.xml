<p class="p">However, the source of new zero-valent sulfur must ultimately be the only large available sulfur pool in these deposits: sulfate from anhydrite or gypsum. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction is currently the only known energy-yielding microbial pathway capable of converting the stable sulfate molecule into a compound that can be reduced, adenosine phosphosulfate (APS). Sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation state (e.g., sulfite, thiosulfate, trithionate, tetrathionate) are produced and released during oxidative sulfur cycling, but this does not appear to be the case for dissimilatory sulfate reduction which yields only one product: sulfide (for a review, see 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barton et al., 2014</xref>). Sulfate reduction is also known for many assimilatory pathways (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schiff and Fankhauser, 1981</xref>), but this energetically costly sulfur transformation is not likely to be a good candidate as a supplier for sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation state on a scale relevant for the genesis of large native sulfur deposits. It follows that while there is a multitude of processes that can yield native sulfur, canonically, dissimilatory sulfate reduction constitutes the only means to supply the system in which the ENSD is formed with new native sulfur. Because sulfide is presumably the only product of dissimilatory sulfate reduction, its subsequent oxidation is required. Theoretically, in a cryptic sulfur cycle such sulfur could be oxidized by a sulfur compound with intermediate oxidation state, the latter thereby becoming more reduced. However, unless there is an external oxidant such as O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> that re-constitutes sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation states, this cryptic cycle cannot be perpetuated because oxidation power is progressively lost.
