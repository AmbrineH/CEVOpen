<p class="p">Multiple avenues of research can be taken to test our hypothesis. Long-term anaerobic incubations of mixed cultures obtained from sediments from seeps and hypersaline lakes may yield native sulfur – or should accumulate sulfide to a level where metabolic activity ceases. Amendments of such incubations with methylated substrates or acetate could be used to test if formation of native sulfur can be accelerated, a step that might be critical because metabolic rates are expected to be slow due to low energy yields of the involved reactions. The recent findings that dissimilatory sulfur cycling can be carried out by a much larger diversity of microbial groups than previously thought (

 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zecchin et al., 2018</xref>), also enhance the potential to find a dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway that may yield a sulfur compound with intermediate oxidation state instead of sulfide. The fact that the group of peatland 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>, which only possess the genomic toolset to convert sulfite into sulfide and encodes enzymes that liberate sulfite from organosulfonates (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hausmann et al., 2018</xref>), also points to the possibility that alternative sulfate reduction pathways may exist. Such pathways could resemble assimilatory sulfate reduction, which is employed by a much wider group of microorganisms than dissimilatory sulfate reduction (

 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic> that have the ability to perform oxidative and reductive sulfur cycling (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hausmann et al., 2018</xref>) might be a particularly interesting target in sulfur cycling in ENSDs. They are adapted to acidic conditions, which can exist in fluids in sedimentary basins (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kharaka and Hanor, 2014</xref>) and have been found in soils and aquifers contaminated with hydrocarbons (

 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salam et al., 2017</xref>), which indicates that they can tolerate exposure to oil. Their versatility, and particularly ability to thrive at low abundance of nutrients while showing high tolerance to toxic compounds, may give 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic> competitive advantages (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kielak et al., 2016</xref>) in settings that are nutrient-poor (evaporite rocks), rich in hydrocarbons, and have elevated concentrations of toxic compounds. For two reasons,

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hausmann et al., 2018</xref>), which might enable genesis of native sulfur in presence of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. (2) Their adaptation to acidic conditions could be advantageous in native sulfur formation that is driven by dynamic changes in hydrocarbon and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> supply, where the pH might fluctuate between acidic conditions due to supply with acidic deep fluids, which can exist in sedimentary basins (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kharaka and Hanor, 2014</xref>), and neutral to basic conditions during which carbonates precipitate.
