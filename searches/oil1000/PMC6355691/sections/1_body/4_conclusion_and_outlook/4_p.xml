<p class="p">A suite of geological and geochemical analyses could be employed to explore our hypothesis that native sulfur genesis takes place in the absence of an external oxidant. Although morphological evidence for their presence is difficult to find in rocks, biofilms have been involved in seep carbonate formation (

 <xref rid="B233" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zwicker et al., 2018</xref>), implying that they might have been overlooked in authigenic carbonates associated with ENSDs. Searching for fabrics that may represent former biofilms and analyzing them for trace metals and biomarkers could reveal if there were steep biogeochemical gradients during carbonate formation, which may be indicative for the presence of electron acceptors and sulfide in close spatial or temporal proximity. Biomarkers of sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanotrophic archaea involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peckmann and Thiel, 2004</xref>) could provide insight if cryptic carbon cycling includes not only methane consumption but also methanogenesis with both processes being potentially involved in the formation of ENSDs fueled by crude oil. To test if native sulfur was formed by comproportionation under high temperatures, carbonates from native sulfur deposits can be analyzed for their clumped carbon-oxygen isotope composition to pin down the temperature of carbonate formation or diagenesis (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mill√°n et al., 2016</xref>), a measurement that can be combined with the extraction of tourmaline formed in the early diagenesis of evaporites, which is a recorder of their thermal history (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gomes et al., 2018</xref>) techniques of CAS and other sulfur phases will reveal if the sulfur isotope systematics follow steady-state or Rayleigh fractionation patterns. With these approaches, we now have the tools to solve a conundrum that has puzzled scientists for over 100 years.
