<p class="p">Several lines of evidence indicate that the genesis of native sulfur in ENSDs has occurred in absence of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This does not preclude the genesis of native sulfur by oxidation with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, as there are examples where that option appears realistic, such as in intermittent oxidation of sulfide (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jassim et al., 1999</xref>) or the oxidation of sulfide in a soil-influenced environment (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peckmann et al., 1999</xref>). In analogy to the genesis of caves (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kirkland, 2014</xref>), large cavities in carbonate caprocks from the United States Gulf Coast (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fenneman, 1906</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barton and Paxson, 1925</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Taylor, 1938</xref>), could be due to leaching by sulfuric acid formed by the oxidation of native sulfur with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Acid generation could even cause spontaneous and rapid native sulfur precipitation from polysulfides. While acknowledging that such scenarios exist, our hypothesis removes the dogma that O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> must be available for the genesis of large amounts of native sulfur. We show that formation of native sulfur in strictly anoxic environments is not only thermodynamically feasible, but also that highly saline and sulfidic conditions are conducive for a suite of microbial processes to occur that could yield zero-valent sulfur as product (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). The hypothesized microbial pathways are compatible with so far puzzling observations, like the persistent presence of sulfur disproportionating organisms in AOM cultures and in the environment (
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wegener et al., 2016</xref>), the ubiquity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Deltaproteobacteria</italic> despite low sulfate reduction rates in hypersaline waters (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Borin et al., 2009</xref>), and the apparent presence of oxidative (cryptic) sulfur cycling near sulfate-methane transition zones (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Holmkvist et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, they could serve as a model for the genesis of (1) native sulfur nodules that are infrequently found in drill cores in sediments with little iron content, which allows for high sulfide concentrations, such as sediments from the Bahamas (Bahamas Transect ODP Leg 166, Site 1005, Hole C, Core 033; 
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shipboard Scientific Party, 1997</xref>) and the Great Australian Bight (Leg 182, Site 1129C, Core 20H, Section 4; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Feary et al., 2000</xref>), which is a carbonate sequence in which sulfide and methane are co-generated (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitterer et al., 2001</xref>), or Lake Petén Itzá (Core 6A-4H-2; 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hodell et al., 2006</xref>); and (2) native sulfur associated with hydrocarbon seep environments (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lin et al., 2018</xref>).
