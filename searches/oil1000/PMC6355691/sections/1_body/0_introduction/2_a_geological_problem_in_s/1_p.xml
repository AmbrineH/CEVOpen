<p class="p">In the last three decades, the fields of environmental microbiology and biogeochemistry have made great progress. The new insights on microbial sulfur transformations and improved understanding of light stable isotope systematics and fractionation prompt us to re-evaluate the paradigm that presence of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is a prerequisite for the formation of ENSDs. In Section “Challenges With O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as the Electron Acceptor for Sulfide Oxidation,” we first review the issues that arise with O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> being a prerequisite for the formation of native sulfur deposits. In Section “Alternatives to the Oxidation of Sulfide With O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for the Genesis of Epigenetic Native Sulfur Deposits,” we introduce potential microbiological solutions to this geological problem. These solutions include metabolisms related to methylated compounds, ammonium transformations, and sulfur comproportionation reactions, which may allow for native sulfur genesis and accumulation on a geologic scale in the absence of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or other oxidants, such as nitrate or metal oxides. We demonstrate that (1) these processes are thermodynamically feasible, (2) response to sulfide stress could be the trigger for organisms to shift from the most energy yielding process (sulfide generation) to a less energy yielding catabolism (native sulfur formation) because it is more sustainable, and (3) environmental and experimental data indicate that the hypothesized processes indeed exist.
