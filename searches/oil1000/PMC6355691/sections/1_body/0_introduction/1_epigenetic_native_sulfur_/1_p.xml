<p class="p">Native sulfur is formed by a number of abiotic and biological processes in a multitude of settings such as deeply buried sediments by thermochemical sulfate reduction (

 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schulz and Schulz, 2005</xref>), in sulfidic cave systems (e.g., incomplete sulfide oxidation by 
 <italic class="italic">Sulfurovum-like Epsilonproteobacteria</italic>; 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hamilton et al., 2015</xref>), or at the seafloor as filamentous sulfur (i.e., by

 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sievert et al., 2007</xref>). On a geologic timescale, many of the native sulfur accumulations in these environments are transient. Upon burial native sulfur can be reduced to sulfide, whereas extended periods of exposure to oxic conditions lead to its oxidation to sulfate. Indeed, evidence for large filamentous sulfide-oxidizing bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Beggiatoa</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Thioploca</italic> is available for only few examples that represent syngenetic native sulfur formation (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Druckman et al., 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burhan et al., 2002</xref>). Syngenetic native sulfur deposits are formed at the same time as the strata that host them, whereas epigenetic native sulfur deposits (ENSDs) are emplaced after the formation of the host rocks. There are two categories of ENSDs: caprock and stratabound deposits (
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ruckmick et al., 1979</xref>). When interpreted to have formed to a large extent by biological processes, they are referred to as bioepigenetic. The native sulfur in bioepigenetic deposits typically replaces a sulfate-bearing host rock, such as gypsum (CaSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ⋅ 2H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) or anhydrite (CaSO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), and is commonly associated with authigenic carbonate minerals, such as calcite, aragonite, or dolomite. In stratabound deposits, native sulfur replaces sulfate-rich strata that were emplaced during the deposition of evaporite rocks, whereas in caprock deposits, native sulfur replaces sulfates that had accumulated at the crest of a salt diapir through preferential dissolution of sodium chloride salts (Figure

 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Klimchouk, 1997</xref>). Ultimately, the driver for the replacement of sulfate-bearing host rocks is the availability of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds (e.g., carboxylic acids), which can be supplied by the migration of oil and natural gas. The organic compounds fuel sulfate reduction by coupling it to carbon oxidation, a process that yields carbonate minerals and reduced sulfur species.
