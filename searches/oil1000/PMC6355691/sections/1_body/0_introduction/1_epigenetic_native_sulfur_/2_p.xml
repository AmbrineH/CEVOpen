<p class="p">Bioepigenetic native sulfur deposits can be enormous, with sizes reaching 89 and 500 million tons of native sulfur for caprock and stratabound deposits, respectively (

 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). It has been estimated that approximately four barrels of oil (∼560 kg) or 72,000 cubic feet of methane (∼1300 kg) are needed to form one metric ton of native sulfur (

 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Long, 1992a</xref>) is a comparably small caprock deposit, this would correspond to 0.56 million barrels of crude oil. However, based on a minimum weight estimate of carbonate caprock of 32.7 million metric tons, and assuming that the carbon in the rock was derived from oil, the consumption was approximated to be 34.2 million barrels of crude oil (approximately 4.9 million metric tons; 
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sassen et al., 1994</xref>). This demonstrates that calculations of hydrocarbon consumption based on the presence of native sulfur are minimum estimates. While such numbers may appear staggering, a comparison shows that oil and gas reservoirs can supply the required hydrocarbon volumes. Damon Mound, which compared to other salt domes in the United States Gulf Coast salt province is considered a small oil reservoir (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sassen et al., 1994</xref>), yielded a cumulative oil production of 21.6 million barrels (
