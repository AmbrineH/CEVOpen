<p class="p">In these scenarios, native sulfur is preserved because the high levels of sulfide inhibit further disproportionation of zero-valent sulfur, leading to the accumulation of dissolved zero-valent sulfur and polysulfides and the subsequent precipitation of native sulfur (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Formation of native sulfur could be further modulated by coupling of sulfur transformations to nitrogen cycling as a means to cope with sulfide stress.
