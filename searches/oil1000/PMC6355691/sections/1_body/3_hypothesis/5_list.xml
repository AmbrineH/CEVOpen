  <p class="p">Their detection in the laboratory is hampered by experimental challenges, including O
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>-contamination at all times, working with high pressures (e.g., methane, CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and high concentrations of sulfide and/or salt over long durations. The latter may further slow down a process with a notoriously low energy yield due to salt and sulfide stress.
