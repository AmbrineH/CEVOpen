 <p> Sulfur isotopes systematics in epigenetic sulfur deposits. Compilation of data from United States Gulf Coast, Polish, and Sicilian native sulfur deposits, data normalized to presumed sulfur isotope composition of sulfate source (set to zero, data presented as an offset between isotope compositions; Î” 34S). The sulfur isotope compositon of native sulfur is lighter and the residual sulfates isotopically heavier than the original sulfate mineral. The isotope offset between native sulfur and original sulfate is much smaller than the offset between original sulfate and residual sulfate. However, the enrichment in 34S does not exceed the theoretical maximum isotope fractionation for microbial sulfate reduction. Data sources: Huckley, Boling, Moss Bluff, and Spindletop domes ( Feely and Kulp, 1957; Kyle and Agee, 1988); Damon Mound (new data); Poland ( Parafiniuk et al., 1994); Sicily ( Ziegenbalg et al., 2010). </p>
