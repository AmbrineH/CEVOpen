 <p> Sketches of classical epigenetic salt diapir caprock and stratabound sulfur deposit types. (A) Oxygen is delivered to the site where native sulfur is formed by infiltration of meteoric water. On its journey to the location where native sulfur is formed, O 2 has to pass hydrocarbon bearing strata. Solubility of O 2 may decrease with depth due to increased salinity. To maintain inflow of meteoric waters, the brine must be removed (modified from Ruckmick et al., 1979). (B) Oxygen is delivered to the site where native sulfur is formed by infiltration of meteoric water. On its journey to the location where native sulfur is formed, O 2 takes the same route as the hydrocarbons. Solubility of O 2 may decrease with depth due to increased salinity. To maintain inflow of meteoric waters, the brine must be removed (modified from Ruckmick et al., 1979). </p>
