 <p> Genesis of native sulfur in presence (left) and absence (right) of O 2. (Left) In a system where native sulfur genesis is driven by supply with O 2, there is a competion between oxygen-consuming aerobic hydrocarbon oxidation and oxidation of sulfide to native sulfur. Replacement of gypsum with carbonate is confined to the interface between solid gypsum and hydrocarbons in order to maintain low-oxygen conditions required for sulfate-reducing bacteria using extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) could help produce native sulfur in close association with sulfate-reducing bacteria. (Right) In an oxygen-free environment, sulfate reduction can take place detached from gypsum surfaces at the hydrocarbon-brine interface because gypsum dissolution provides sulfate to the brine. Sulfur cycling may include simultaneous genesis and consumption of methane and sulfate, constituting complete cryptic carbon and sulfur cycles. Sulfide-oxidizing microbes (SOM) produce methane and native sulfur. Sulfur disproportionating bacteria (SDB) convert sulfur compounds with intermediate oxidation state or native sulfur into sulfate and sulfide. Finally, anearobic oxidation of methane (AOM) consumes sulfate and methane. Sulfide can react with native sulfur to form polysulfides, a reaction that is reverted during carbonate precipitation, due to local increase in acidity. </p>
