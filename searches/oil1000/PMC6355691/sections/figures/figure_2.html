 <p> Schematic of genesis of sulfide, native sulfur and carbonate minerals from hydrocarbons and calcium sulfate minerals. The red arrows with question marks indicate that native sulfur is either formed by an unknown microbial pathway or that an unknown oxidant is needed for the conversion of sulfide into native (zero-valent) sulfur. In cases where dolomite is formed, there must be a (unknown) source of magnesium. Dissolved sulfate in system (gray box) can become trapped in newly formed carbonate minerals as carbonate associated sulfate (CAS). </p>
