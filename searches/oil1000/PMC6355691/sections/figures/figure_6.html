 <p> Systems with ample and restricted fluid flow (i.e., removal of sulfate). Examples for sulfur isotope patterns in a system with ample, semi-restricted and restricted fluid flow. The input of sulfate from dissolution of gypsum/anhydrite (chosen δ 34S of +14‰), the sulfur isotope fractionation by sulfate reduction is assumed to be 75‰. (Top) If most of the sulfate that enters the system also leaves the system (ample fluid flow), the δ 34S of the residual sulfate (CAS) matches the δ 34S of original sulfate and the δ 34S of native sulfur is strongly offset to low values. (Middle) If half of the sulfate entering the system is converted to native sulfur, native sulfur and residual sulfate will have the same absolute isotopic offset from residual sulfate. (Bottom) If essentially all sulfate that enters the system is converted to native sulfur, the δ 34S of native sulfur matches the δ 34S of original sulfate, and the δ 34S of the residual sulfate is strongly offset to isotopically heavier values. </p>
