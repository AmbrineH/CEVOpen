  <p class="p">Carbon isotopes systematics in epigenetic sulfur deposits. Compilation of carbon isotope data from carbonates from epigenetic native sulfur deposits. Thermogenic or biogenic methane is isotopically very light and may have contributed to the formation of carbonates at various sites, such as the south-eastern Mediterranean Coastal Plain of Israel and Northern Sinai (
