   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Oxygen is delivered to the site where native sulfur is formed by infiltration of meteoric water. On its journey to the location where native sulfur is formed, O

   <sub class="sub">2</sub> may decrease with depth due to increased salinity. To maintain inflow of meteoric waters, the brine must be removed (modified from
