 <p> Carbon isotopes systematics in epigenetic sulfur deposits. Compilation of carbon isotope data from carbonates from epigenetic native sulfur deposits. Thermogenic or biogenic methane is isotopically very light and may have contributed to the formation of carbonates at various sites, such as the south-eastern Mediterranean Coastal Plain of Israel and Northern Sinai ( Nissenbaum, 1984), the Hackberry salt dome, Louisiana, United States ( McManus and Hanor, 1993); the Carpathian Foredeep, Poland ( Parafiniuk et al., 1994; BÃ¶ttcher and Parafiniuk, 1998), Sicily, Italy ( Ziegenbalg et al., 2012), and within stratiform native sulfur deposits in the Castile anhydrite in the northwestern and west-central Delaware Basin, United States ( Kirkland, 2014). The carbon isotope composition of carbonates from Damon Mound (this study) fall almost entirely into the range between oil-derived carbon and carbonate from seawater, but a contribution from methane cannot be excluded. </p>
