 <p class="p">This work would not have been possible without the help and advice from Mr. Joseph Mussey (Texas Mines Venture) who provided us with invaluable insight and guidance regarding epigenetic stratabound sulfur deposits of the Delaware Basin. We thank Mr. Neil O. Yelderman for kindly granting us access to the Damon Mound site, Neal Immega for valuable information about Damon Mound, Piper Poe (UTEP) for assistance in the field, Madalina Jaggi (ETH Zürich) for assistance with isotope analyses of carbonates, and Drs. Gail L. Arnold (UTEP), Mark Engle (USGS), Trinity Hamilton (University of Minnesota), Lin Ma (UTEP), and Jie Xu (UTEP) for insightful comments that helped us shape this manuscript. We would also like to express our gratitude to Dr. Katherine Giles, the members of the Caprock Club, the Institute of Tectonic Studies, and the Salt-Sediment Interaction Research Consortium for their support, encouragement, and stimulating input. Two reviewers provided us with important information about new findings in microbial sulfur cycling, and helpful guidance in making the manuscript more accessible to a broad readership – thank you! Lastly, AL would like to thank the endless love and support of her family and friends.</p>
