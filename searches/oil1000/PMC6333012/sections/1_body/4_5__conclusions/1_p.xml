<p class="p">The present work provides for the first time phytochemical and biological evidence about
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO obtained from fresh leaves collected from plants in the Amazonian Ecuador. The chemical characterization of the EO showed important differences in comparison with other EOs from the same species but from different geographical areas: these results reflect the adapting behaviour of plants to different environments.
