 <italic class="italic">Piper carpunya </italic>Ruiz &amp; Pav leaves of adult plants from three different stocks were collected in November 2014 at balsamic period (before flowering) from wild shrubs growing in the outskirts of the Kutuku Experimental Station, province of Morona Santiago, Ecuador. After harvesting, the
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> leaves were
 <italic class="italic"> in situ </italic>immediately subjected to hydrodistillation using a portable Clevenger-type apparatus. The EO was extracted by steam distillation (3 h) of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> fresh leaves (8 kg) using deionized water (8 L). The refractive index was measured at 20°C using the refractometer Abbe 60, while density was checked using a densitometer DCE-DB 600. The essential oil samples were then stored in amber airtight glass vials at 18±0.5°C to prevent degradations prior to analyses. A specimen of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO was deposited at Salesian Polytechnic University (Quito, Ecuador) (voucher specimen: HUPS-pi-002). Aliquots of the EO samples were then transferred maintaining the storage conditions of the original specimen to the Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Ferrara (Ferrara, Italy) for chemical and biological analyses.
