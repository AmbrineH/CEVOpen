<p class="p">Antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity against different strains of human pathogen yeast
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans </italic>were performed using the EO and the most abundant compounds, as putative most responsible agent of biological properties. With specific reference to antimicrobial activities, synergistic interactions were also checked in order to explore the possibility of increasing the biological efficacy employing a formulation with different ratio of EO and fluconazole as synthetic drug commonly used in pharmaceuticals for treating candidiasis. Ames test was finally performed to assess safety of
