<p class="p">To investigate the possible genotoxic activity of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO, Ames test employing the
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella typhimurium</italic> strains TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA1535 was performed [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. An inoculum of each bacterial strain culture (100
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) was added to 20 ml of Nutrient Broth and incubated at 37°C in an orbital shaker (120 rpm) until a microbial concentration of approximately 2 x 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> bacteria/ml is reached. Petri dishes (90 mm diameter) containing a basic agar and low concentrations of histidine and biotin were topped with 2 ml of molten agar (45°C) prepared with 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of fresh bacterial culture and 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of EO diluted in DMSO (dilution range: 0.1-10 mg/plate). The mutagenic activity was determined on the basis of the counted colonies of each
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella</italic> strain in plates treated with different concentrations of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO with metabolic activation [addition of 500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of S9 mix dissolved in a solution of KCl (33mM), NADPH (4mM), MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (8mM), and glucose-6-phosphate (5mM)] or, alternatively, without metabolic activation (500 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of 7.4 pH phosphate buffer). Positive controls were set up with 2 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/plate of 2-aminoanthracene for all
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella</italic> strains cultured with metabolic activation; and 2 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/plate of 2-nitrofluorene for strains TA97a, TA98, TA1535, and 1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/plate of sodium azide for TA100 strain, for Ames test performed without activation by S9 mix. Negative controls were set up with 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of DMSO, both with and without S9 mix. The plates were incubated for three days at 37°C and colonies were counted (Colony Counter 560 Suntex, Antibioticos, Italy). All the mutagenic assays were performed in triplicate and the results, integrated by statistical analyses, were considered positive when the number of colonies of revertants was at least double if compared to those of the negative controls [
