<p class="p">To confirm the synergistic activity, a time-killing fungicide curve was performed [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Based on the synergistic results,
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic> AIDS6 strain was used to test
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO and fluconazole combination. AIDS6 strain was grown in tubes filled with Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB, LTD Oxoid, Basingstoke, Ampshire, England) for 24 h at 28°C. Then, AIDS6 cultures were centrifuged, washed and resuspended to reach a concentration of 2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL in RPMI-1640 buffered with MOPS at pH 7.0 and incubated at 28°C. The following four samples were tested in triplicate: (i)
 <italic class="italic"> P.carpunya</italic> EO (MIC value); (ii) fluconazole (MIC value); (iii)
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya </italic>EO and fluconazole in combination (best FIC
 <sub class="sub">index</sub> concentrations); (iv)
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya </italic>EO and fluconazole in combination (the first value higher than the best FIC
 <sub class="sub">index</sub> concentrations). Tween 20 (0.2%) has been added to increase the solubility of the EO. The same procedure was used to prepare the negative controls (AIDS6 culture and Tween 20, 0.2%). Each sample was incubated at 30°C and gently shacked (100 rpm). Cell growth was monitored at time 0, after 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h and 24h; 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of the AIDS6 culture at each monitoring time was serially diluted (dilution range 1-10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>). One hundred microlitres (100
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) of each dilution was seeded in Petri dishes (90 mm diameter) containing SDA and incubated for 48 h at 30°C in the dark. After incubation, the grown AIDS6 colonies were counted [
