<p class="p">Antimicrobial tests were carried out by the microbroth dilution method using three
 <italic class="italic"> Candida </italic>spp. strains:
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans </italic>(AIDS6; fluconazole resistant clinical strain isolated from a HIV patient),
 <italic class="italic"> Candida glabrata </italic>(FLU 43976; resistant to fluconazole), and
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans </italic>(ATCC 24433; from American Type Culture Collections; sensitive to fluconazole). The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was determined through the microdilution method in accordance with “Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute/National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards” (CLSI / NCCLS).
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO and fluconazole, used as positive control, were diluted on 96-well microplate, obtaining 8 different concentrations (from 48.8 to 6250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL and from 0.5 to 64 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL respectively), tested in triplicate. In each microwell,
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> strains were inoculated to reach a final concentration of 2.5x10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> CFU/mL and incubated for 48 hours at 30°C with the EO samples and fluconazole at different concentrations; the final total volume in each well was 200
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> culture media were RPMI-1640 supplemented with 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) at pH 7.0; Tween 20 (0.2%; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to improve the solubility. The MIC was determined by direct observation of the turbidity of the culture medium. The MIC values were represented by the lowest concentration at which no turbidity of the medium was observed. Then, the Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) was checked by transferring 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of the culture medium of each well into a new well with Saboraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) and incubating at 30°C for 48 hours. The final volume in each well was 200 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L. The MFC was considered as the lowest concentration that did not determine
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> growth. Culture media and Tween 20 (0.2%) solution (200
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) were used as negative control.
