 <italic class="italic">P. carpunya</italic> EO was analyzed by a Varian GC- 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian MS-4000 mass spectrometer using electron impact and hooked to NIST library. A Varian FactorFour VF-5ms poly-5% phenyl-95%-dimethylsiloxane column (internal diameter, 0.25 mm; length, 30 m; film thickness, 0.15 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m) was used. The following conditions were adopted: injector temperature 250°C, carrier (Helium) flow rate 1 mL/min and split ratio 1:50. Oven temperature was as follows: from 55 to 100°C at a rate of 1°C/min, from 100 to 250°C at a rate of 5°C/min and then kept constant at 250°C for 15 min. One microliter of sample dissolved in methanol was injected. For the calculation of the relative retention time (RI), a mixture of C8 to C32 hydrocarbons (Sigma-Aldrich), was previously injected into the system applying the same method used to analyze EO. The constituents of the volatile oil were identified by comparing their GC relative retention times, RI and the MS fragmentation pattern with those of other EOs of known composition, with pure compounds and by matching the MS fragmentation patterns, as well as retention indices, with the above mentioned mass spectra libraries and with those in the literature [

 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>Amp; scan rate, 1 scan/s; mass range, 29–400 Da; trap temperature, 150°C and transfer line temperature, 300°C. For the quantitative analysis a ThermoQuest GC-Trace gas-chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and the same column above described were used. The operating conditions for gas chromatograph were reported above. FID temperature was 250°C. The oil percentage composition was performed by the normalization method from the GC peak areas, without using correction factors.
