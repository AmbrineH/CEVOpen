<p class="p">Despite the abundant scientific reports about
 <italic class="italic"> Piper</italic> species, the knowledge about
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO is still scarce. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to characterize the EO obtained from the leaves of the Ecuadorian
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> and to evaluate its biological activities. A phytochemical fingerprint was performed through gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GCâ€“MS) in order to chemically characterize the EO. It was subsequently tested
 <italic class="italic"> in vitro </italic>for antioxidant and antimicrobial evaluations, also through synergistic and time-killing assays, in order to verify the traditional uses assuming that the bioactivities were mainly due to the terpene fraction. For this reason, the most abundant terpene compounds detected in the EO were also tested for the same bioactivities, trying to identify those molecules putatively responsible of the biological properties. Finally, in order to assess the safety of the
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO, Ames test with
 <italic class="italic"> S. typhimurium</italic> strains was performed to check possible genotoxic implications.
