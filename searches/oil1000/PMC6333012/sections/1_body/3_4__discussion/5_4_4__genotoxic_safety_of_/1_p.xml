<p class="p">To complement the awareness on the efficacy and the safe possible use of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO, Ames test was carried out [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. EOs can be used topically or orally administered and the careful examination of possible mutagenic properties is required to confirm and assure the safety of their use [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Moreover, some evidence of possible genotoxic activities exerted by EOs is emerging [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Traditional uses are by no means warrants of safety since complex set of symptoms and cause-effect relationships are not easily recognized and identified by the population [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, and references therein]. Our results pointed out the safety of the
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO with regard to genotoxicity, suggesting also by this aspect the potentiality of its health uses.
