In fact, the possibility to enhance bioactivity of health products combining natural products, such as EOs, and synthetic drugs through synergistic interactions gives the opportunity to reduce the amount of synthetic active compounds, reducing at the same time their adverse effects without limiting the therapeutic efficacy. This kind of results obviously highly valorizes the EO of
