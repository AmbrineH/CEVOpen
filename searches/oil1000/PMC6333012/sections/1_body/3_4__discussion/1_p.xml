<p class="p">For the past several years our research group has been involved in studying Amazonian medicinal plants through their chemical and biological fingerprinting starting from ethnomedical information. These research projects contributed to expanding the knowledge about those plants which are rarely or never studied but which may potentially play a role in improving the efficacy and safety of pharmaceuticals and health products. Moreover, Amazonian plants are particularly interesting since the Amazonian basin is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots, where the ecological conditions and the high density of species per unit area drive the plant secondary metabolism to biosynthetic pathways which are particularly rich in different chemical structures [

Therefore, the present research is part of a large project aimed to characterize the Amazonian medicinal flora, with particular reference to aromatic plants which represent the largest part of the sources used in traditional medicinal preparations. Since most of the plant species used as traditional health remedies are characterized by flavour and aromatic smell, the study of EOs is one of the best strategies to draw a research profile matching biodiversity and phytomedicine. For this reason, the chemical fingerprinting is focused on the characterization of EOs, while the biological activities are assayed through
