<p class="p">As far as we know, only few papers dealt with the chemical composition of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO. However, comparing our results with those reported for
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO from Peru emerged important differences [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. From a qualitative point of view, every compound detected in the
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya </italic>EO from Peru [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] was present in our EO from Amazonian Ecuador, but in smaller quantities. The latter obtained by Ecuadorian plants showed the main abundance of piperitone (26.2%), limonene (9.5%), elemicin (7.2%), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-phellandrene (5.6%), methyleugenol (4.5), and 1,8-cineole (4.0%), while the analogous EO obtained by Peruvian plants was reported to contain safrole, 1,8-cineole, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-terpinene, p-cymene, spathulenol and bycyclogermacrene as the terpene compounds occurring in highest amount. These results highlight the high plasticity of the
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya </italic>species in adapting to different environmental and allelopathic conditions, such as those of Peru and Amazonian Ecuador, and its capacity to produce an EO with a strongly different composition.
