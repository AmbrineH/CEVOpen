<p class="p">Fresh leaves of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> were collected during the balsamic period (before flowering) and directly steam-distilled to obtain the essential oil. The distillation yield was of 0.76% (w/w%), the refractive index of 1.49 ± 0.02, and the density of 0.928 ± 0.040 g/mL. The colour was pale yellow, and the smell was persistent and strongly aromatic, similar to that of pepper. GC-MS analyses were performed to determine the chemical characterization of the essential oil: fortytwo (42) compounds (96.2% of the total) were identified. Piperitone (26.2%), limonene (9.5%), elemicin (7.2%), 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-phellandrene (5.6%), methyleugenol (4.5%), and 1,8-cineole (4.0%) were the most abundant (
