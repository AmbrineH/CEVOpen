<p class="p">The DPPH assay was performed to test the antioxidant capacity of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO and of the main compounds detected in the phytocomplex. The results were compared to those achieved with positive control Trolox® and thymol, taken as reference terpene with well-known antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>].The antioxidant activity of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO was moderately interesting with values very far from both pure compound thymol and Trolox®. Piperitone, limonene, 1,8-cineole, and methyleugenol were tested alone as pure compounds: only the last was active, but the activity of EO could not be explained by these molecules. Their mixture or other minor compounds could be responsible of the DPPH capacity.
