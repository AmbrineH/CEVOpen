<p class="p">The synergistic effect of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO with fluconazole was confirmed by time-kill curve experiments performed employing the
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans </italic>(AIDS6) strain since it showed the best FIC
 <sub class="sub">index</sub>. The strain (cell density of 1â€“5 x 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL) was exposed to MIC values of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO, of fluconazole alone and of the EO-fluconazole mixture that displayed the best FIC
 <sub class="sub">index</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Time-kill analysis showed that the mixture of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya </italic>EO and fluconazole almost totally inhibited the growth of the
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> strain over 24 hours compared to the negative control. In particular, after only 2 hours of exposure, the microbial growth was almost completely reduced to values similar to those detected after 24 h.
