<p class="p">The presence of synergistic effects of a mixture characterized by different concentrations of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO and fluconazole (1:1) was checked on the three
 <italic class="italic"> Candida </italic>sp.strains. The MIC and MFC results that gave the best FIC
 <sub class="sub">index</sub> data are reported in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The MIC and MFC values obtained with EO plus fluconazole solution (EO: 391 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL; fluconazole: 4 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) were 4-folds lower than those displayed by the sole EO for both
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans </italic>(AIDS6) and
 <italic class="italic"> C. glabrata </italic>(FLU 43976). The MIC and MFC obtained with the sole fluconazole were 32-folds higher than those achieved with the mixture of EO and synthetic drug for
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans </italic>(AIDS6), while they were 8-folds for
 <italic class="italic"> C. glabrata </italic>(FLU 43976). No synergistic effects were evidenced for
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans </italic>(ATCC 24433).
