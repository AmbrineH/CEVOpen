<p class="p">Different concentrations of the
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya </italic>EO did not show any genotoxic effect on
 <italic class="italic"> Salmonella </italic>TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA1535 strains. Just two doses exhibited mutagenic activity (t/c ≥ 2) against TA1535 and TA97a strain, without metabolic activator (S9 mix) at 500 and 1000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L/plate, respectively. On the other hand, in presence of S9 mix microsomal fraction, the only TA1535 strain evidenced a mutagen sensitivity in presence of the EO both at 500 and 1000 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L/plate. In any case, no dose-response trend was observed suggesting the conclusion of the safety of
 <italic class="italic"> P. carpunya</italic> EO with regard to genotoxicity.
