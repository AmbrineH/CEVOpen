<p class="p">Our investigation showed that repellency of 40% oregano oil was 100% against the common bed bugs in Petri dish test. It repellency index was similar to 33% DEET at 3 and 5h and it was more effective than 33% DEET at 9h after application. The 40% concentration of oregano oil was found to be safer for application in human environments and also for personal protection. While EcoRaider (1% geraniol, 1% cedar extract, and 2% sodium lauryl sulfate) and bed bug patrol (0.003% clove oil, 1% peppermint oil, and 1.3% sodium lauryl sulfate) as botanical repellents did not exhibit detectable repellency against bed bug in the presence of carbon dioxide source (
