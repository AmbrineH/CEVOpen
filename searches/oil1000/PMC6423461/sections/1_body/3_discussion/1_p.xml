<p class="p">In this study, terpineol (22.85%) was the most abundant chemical component of oregano essential oil followed by α-terpinene with 20.6% (v/v). The component of α-terpinene in 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> collected from Mazandaran was 1.018% (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). The plant phenology and composition was likely affected by ecologic conditions. The percentage of carvacrol obtained 4.9% in the present investigation. The percentage of carvacrol, collected from various localities in West Azarbaijan Province of Iran were reported in the range of 23.54% to 67.09% (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). The chemical composition of oregano oil changed due to plants’ development, the population or variation, and the cultivation conditions. The content of carvacrol depends on climatic condition and also it is can be variable in budding period and in full bloom (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). In addition, difference in the chemical composition of oregano oil from previously published papers with our study may is regarding the type of oregano subspecies. Two percent of α-terpinene, monoterpenes derived from 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> were reported with stronger repellency activity than DEET against 
 <italic class="italic">Culex pipiens</italic> (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). In our findings, oregano essential oil showed more potential as repellent compound than 33% DEET, a commercial product, against bed bugs. The high concentration α-terpinene may be responsible for the oil’s repellency.
