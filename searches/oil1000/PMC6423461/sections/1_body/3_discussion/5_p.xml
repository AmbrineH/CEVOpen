<p class="p">DEET, picaridin, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and citronella oil were tested for repellency activity on 
 <italic class="italic">Triathoma rubida</italic> using small restrained rats. No long-range repellency was observed. Only citronella oil was able to stop all probing and feeding of 
 <italic class="italic">T. rubida</italic> and appears to be a promising potential repellent to prevent sleeping people from being bitten by kissing bugs (
