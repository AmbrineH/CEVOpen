<p class="p">According to the Petri dish repellency assay, the oregano essential oil of 2.5% showed 10% repellency after 24h. While the same concentration of oil demonstrated 99.1% repellent activity on the brown-banded cockroach (
 <italic class="italic">Supella longipalpa</italic>) after the same time (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). The sub-lethal concentrations (LC
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">30</sub>) of oregano essential oil had an average repellency of 22.8% and 49.8% against the diamondback moth (
 <italic class="italic">Plutella xylustella</italic>) respectively (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>). Insect species, method of test, formulation, and concentrations of the oil were responsible for the different results observed in the reported investigations. However the repellency indices were different between selected concentrations of oregano oil and there was no significant difference between efficacy of DEET (33%) with 20% oregano oil at 3, 5, 9h post exposure. No repel activity was observed in the control group of our study and all the bed bugs stayed under harborage at 3, 5, and 9h post ethanol exposure.
