<p class="p">Gas-chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used for the analysis and identification of oregano essential oil compounds (Hewlett-Packard 6890, Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, California, USA). It is equipped with HP–5MS column (30m× 0.25mm× 0.25 μm). The initial temperature used was 40 °C for 1min and was later raised to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min and finally raised to 270 °C for 5min at a rate of 20 °C/min. Other parameters of the GC-MC machine included carrier gas Helium (99/999%), injector temperature (260 °C), detector temperature (FID, 270 °C), splitless mode, ionization potential of 70eV, scan rate of 1 scan/sec, the scan range of m/z 40–48 was used for all analysis. The essential oil constituents were identified by comparing their retention indices, mass spectra fragmentation with those in a stored Wiley 7n.1 mass computer library and those of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (
