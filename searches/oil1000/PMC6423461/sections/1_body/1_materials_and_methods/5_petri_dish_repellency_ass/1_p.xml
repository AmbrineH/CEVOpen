<p class="p">Oregano essential oil at concentrations of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40% (V/V) were evaluated against the laboratory-reared bed bugs in plastic Petri dishes and compared with DEET (33%). Moreover, the concentrations were calculated as doses of 0.1, 0.21, 0.43, 0.86, 1.72, 3.45, 6.9mg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for drawing dose-response curve. Plastic Petri dishes of 8cm diameter by 1.5cm height were used in this experiment. Ethanol was used as solvent for essential oil. White filter papers were divided into two equal halves and inserted into the bottom part of the Petri dishes. A piece of folded filter paper was placed in the middle as bed bug harborage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). This part (bed bug harborage) was treated with 0.7ml of essential oil solution using a micro-sampler and the other half was left untreated (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). In the control (negative and positive) plastic Petri dishes group, one half of the filter paper and the harborage were treated with 0.7ml of 96% ethanol or 33% DEET, and the other half was left untreated. Ten-bed bugs (4
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> instars, nymphs and adults) for each treatment group were released into the center of each Petri dish (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The number of bed bugs on each side of the Petri dish was recorded at 3, 5, 9, and 24h post treatment by visual inspection. The experiments were replicated four times for any concentrations in oregano essential oil, Ethanol, and 33% DEET. All Petri dishes were kept at 26±2 °C, photoperiod of 12:12 (L: D) and 55±5% relative humidity (RH).
