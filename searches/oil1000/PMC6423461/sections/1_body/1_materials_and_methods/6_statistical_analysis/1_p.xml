<p class="p">Probit analysis was used to calculate the effective concentration (EC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and EC
 <sub class="sub">99</sub>). Repellency indices were calculated using: repellency =(C–T)/C×100, where C is the mean number of bed bugs located on the treated filter paper in all control plastic Petri dishes, and T is the number of bed bugs located in half part of the treated filter paper at unfixed concentration test in the plastic Petri dishes (
