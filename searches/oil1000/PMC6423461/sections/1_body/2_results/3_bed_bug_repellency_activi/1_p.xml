<p class="p">Repellency indices of oregano essential oil and 33% DEET on 
 <italic class="italic">C. lectularius</italic> are shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The repellency means are noticeable even in very low concentrations at 3h after exposure. The Dunnett test showed, there was no significant difference in repellency between 33% DEET and oregano essential oil in the concentrations of 10, 20 and 40% (P= 0.4). After 5h, the repellent activity of oregano oil was similar to 33% DEET at the concentrations of 10% to 40% and it varied between 86% and 100%. The repellency of oregano oil at the concentrations of 10% and 20% was still obvious (86–93% repellency). Significant difference in repellency was observed between 0.625%, 1.25%, and 2.5% concentrations of oregano essential oil and 33% DEET after 3, 5 and 24h (P&lt; 0.001), while the differences in repellency of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 40% oregano essential oil with 33% DEET were not significant after 3 and 5h (P= 0.25). The concentration of 40% oregano essential oil had 100% repellency against bed bugs at 3, 5 and 24h post exposure, while the repellency index of 33% DEET decreased to 27% after 24h (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The repellency of oregano essential oil at concentrations of 0.625–20% significantly declined from 3h to 24h, but it was constant at a concentration of 40% and exhibited similar repellency to 33% DEET at a concentration of 20%.
