<p class="p">The term allelopathy describes the chemical interactions between plants where one plant interferes with the germination and growth of another plant. Allelopathic compounds are thought to enter the surrounding environment via volatilization, leaching with rain, and decomposition of plant litter, thereby inhibiting the growth of competitors or species that may threaten the plantâ€™s survival. In this manner, the plant may have an ecological role in its ecosystem by affecting plant spacing, succession, and community composition [

 <italic class="italic">C. canescens</italic> is thought to play a significant ecological role in maintaining a healthy scrub ecosystem by inhibiting the germination of native grasses [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-07-00019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. It was suggested that by inhibiting germination of the grasses, the development of the more fire-prone sand hill ecosystem is prevented, and the scrub ecosystem is maintained [

Ursolic acid is thought to act as a natural detergent by leading water-insoluble monoterpenes to form micelles, rendering them water-soluble, thereby enhancing their ability to leach into rainwater for delivery into the soil [
