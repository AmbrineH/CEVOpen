 <p> Effect on the intracellular accumulation of ethidium bromide of (A) DCME extract, (B) epi-cubenol (4), (C) 15-copaenol (6), (D) 15-copaenal (6OX), and (E) 15-copaenyl acetate (6AC) in K1902 (Δ norA) strain. The bacteria were exposed to 2.0 μg/mL of EtBr at 37°C for a period of 1h in the presence of glucose. CCCP (1.25 μg/mL) was used as inhibitor control. </p>
