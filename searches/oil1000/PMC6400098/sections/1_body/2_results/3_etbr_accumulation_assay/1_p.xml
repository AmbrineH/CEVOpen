<p class="p">The effects of different sub-inhibitory concentrations of extracts and compounds isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> on EtBr accumulation were next evaluated in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> wild type (NCTC 8325-4), K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) and K1902 (Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>) strains. Experiments were carried out using EtBr concentrations that did not affect cell viability. The accumulation of EtBr inside the bacterial cells was increased by the presence of an EPI, such as CCCP, an EPI known to work by acting as a protonophore (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lowrence et al., 2016</xref>). Compounds that inhibit the efflux of EtBr results in higher residual fluorescence, whereas non-EPI compounds/untreated cells extrude EtBr, resulting in lower residual fluorescence. Accordingly, only the DCME and 15-copaenol (6) and 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) acted as potential NorA EPIs to induce a higher level of fluorescence over time than was observed for the EtBr curve obtained in untreated K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">C</xref>). In particular, 15-copaenol (6) inhibited EtBr efflux in K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) cells at all evaluated concentrations (3.9–15.6 μg/mL). Even at the lowest concentration, it displayed a higher level of efflux inhibition than was observed for CCCP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that it could be indeed a highly potent efflux inhibitor in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lowrence et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this result, the synthetic derivative, 15-copaenal (6OX) only showed inhibition of EtBr efflux in K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) cells at 125 μg/mL, but not superior to the control inhibitor (CCCP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2D</xref>) and 15-copaenyl acetate (6AC) showed no intrinsic EPI activity against the K2378 strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2E</xref>). The DCME inhibited EtBr efflux in K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) cells at all evaluated concentrations (15.6–62.5 μg/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>), but it did not produce better efflux inhibition than was observed for CCCP. 
 <italic class="italic">Epi</italic>-cubenol (4) inhibited EtBr efflux in the K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) strain only at the highest evaluated concentration (62.5 μg/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>); in those experiments, it produced an effect similar to that of CCCP.
