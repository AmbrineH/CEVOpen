<p class="p">The MICs of all extracts and compounds were evaluated in the NCTC 8325-4 (wild type), K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++), and K1902 (Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>) 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains. The MICs of the samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. In general, MIC values were highest in K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) and lowest in K1902 (Δ
 <italic class="italic">nor</italic>A). In the extracts, PEE was the most active, producing MIC values of 31.3 μg/mL for all of the tested 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains. It was followed by EO and DCME, which produced higher values. Regarding the isolated compounds, 15-copaenol (6) was the most active compound against all evaluated strains, with MIC values of 31.3 μg/mL in 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> wild type and K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++), respectively, and 62.5 μg/mL in K1902 (Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>). It was followed by 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) and cubenol (3), which produced values of 31.3 and 62.5 μg/mL, respectively, in wild type 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 62.5 μg/mL in K1902 (Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>), and 125 μg/mL in K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++). The other compounds produced no intrinsic antibacterial activity against the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains (i.e., MIC &gt; 32 mg/L) (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caspar et al., 2015</xref>). We found that torreyol (5) was inactive against all evaluated strains, similar to the result reported by 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Solis et al. (2004)</xref>, who found that 15-copaenol (6) was more active than cubenol (3) and torreyol (5) against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (ATCC6538p) and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC6633).
