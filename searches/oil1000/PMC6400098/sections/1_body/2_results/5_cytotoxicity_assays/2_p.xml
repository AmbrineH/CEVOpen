<p class="p">The toxicity evaluation of DCME, 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) and 15-copaenol (6) on HeLa cells is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. When HeLa cell was treated with different concentrations of DCME (125–0.98 μg/mL; it was started from the MIC), the cell viability decreased in 7% compared to the control (98% cell viability), with cell viability percentages in a range of 92.3–91.1 in all concentrations tested. Whereas, when the HeLa cells were treated with the highest concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) (125 and 62.5 μg/mL), the viability percentages were reduced to 0.9 and 79.6%, respectively, compared to the control (98.3%). Nevertheless, low concentrations (31.3–1 μg/mL) increases cell viability up to 93.8%. 15-Copaenol showed the greatest toxicity at 62.5 μg/mL (MIC value) and 31.3 μg/mL, and the cell viability decreased by 0.7% and 2%, respectively. By decreasing the concentration to 15.6 and 3.9 μg/mL, the cell viability increased up 94.1%. Finally, using 15-copaenol (6) in concentrations of 1.95–0.49 μg/mL, the viability of HeLa cells increased, respectively, to 96.3% and 98%, significantly equal to the control.
