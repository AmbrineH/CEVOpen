<p class="p">The IR spectrum of the oxidized derivate showed the expected CH valence vibrations and tri-substituted C–C double bond stretching vibration valences from 2,956 to 2,872 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and 1,682 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, respectively. Additionally, it showed a carbonyl group band at 1,707 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> that corresponded to the C–O stretching of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Regarding the NMR analyses, compared with 15-copaenol (6), the methylene group signals from the primary alcohol of 15-copaenol (6) were absent in the oxidized derivate 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectrums. However, the C-15 signal at 191.9 ppm was observed in the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectra. The C-15 signal had an HSQC correlation with an unshielded singlet (1H) at 9.43 ppm (H-15) in the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR spectra. The IR and NMR spectra indicated hydroxyl group oxidation had occurred at C-15 of 15-copaenol (6) to yield an aldehyde group (
