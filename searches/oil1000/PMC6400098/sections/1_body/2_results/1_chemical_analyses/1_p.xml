<p class="p">The compositions of EO and of PEE and DCME isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> were determined according to 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Espinoza et al. (2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018)</xref>, respectively. According to those studies, the isolated EO contained three monoterpenes (0.43%) and 17 sesquiterpenes (86.62%), with (-)-torreyol (5) (24.16%), (-)-cubenol (3) (22.64%), 15-copaenol (6) (15.46%), and Î´-cadinene (10.81%) the most abundant components (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Espinoza et al., 2016</xref>). Regarding the extracts, 19 sesquiterpenes (73.53%) and 6 diterpenes (8.90%) present in the PEE and 17 sesquiterpenes (28.57%) and 5 diterpenes (47.97%) present in the DCME. The sesquiterpenes torreyol (5), cubenol (3), and 15-copaenol (6) were the most abundant compounds in both the PEE and DCME extracts (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Espinoza et al., 2018</xref>). Sesquiterpenes were obtained from the EO and both of the extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood using chromatographic methods and characterized by optical rotation, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. The following sesquiterpenes were identified: (-)-
