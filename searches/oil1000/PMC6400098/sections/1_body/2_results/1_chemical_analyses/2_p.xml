<p class="p">In MIC determination assays, 15-copaenol (6) had the lowest MIC value between all tested sesquiterpenes. Moreover, in an antibacterial assay against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538p) and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC 10876) (Data not published), 15-copaenol exerted the major bacterial growth inhibition. In this context, the structural requirements for antibacterial activity of some terpenoids has been reported. A hydrophobic moiety, consisting of a substituted decalin skeleton, and a hydrophilic region possessing one hydrogen-bond-donor group were the key structural requirements (

Then, in order to evaluate the influence of the primary alcohol group in the antibacterial activity of copaene-type sesquiterpenes, hemi-synthetic modifications of 15-copaenol (6) were performed. Thus, 15-copaenol (6) was treated with acetic anhydride in pyridine and yielded 50.6 mg of a colorless oil. The 15-copaenol (6) was also treated with Jones reagent, and the product was chromatographically purified to yield 39.6 mg of a pale-yellow oil. Both synthetic derivatives were analyzed by attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FT-IR and 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H- and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The IR spectrum of the acetylated derivate showed very strong CH valence vibration frequencies ranging from 2955 to 2872 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; these corresponded to the aliphatic part of the molecule. Additionally, a characteristic tri-substituted C–C double bond stretching vibration valence was observed at 1677 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. C–O stretching, C–C(=O)–O asymmetric stretching, and C–C–O asymmetric stretching were observed at 1,740, 1,236, and 1,046 cm
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, respectively, and were assigned to ester group vibrations. In contrast to 15-copaenol (6), the acetylated compound produced two additional signals in the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectrum, that corresponded to a quaternary carbon (C-1’) and a methyl carbon (C-2’) at 171.4 and 21.4 ppm, respectively. The C-2’ signal showed a HSQC correlation with a singlet (3H) at 2.05 ppm (H-2’). The IR and NMR spectra indicated the substitution of a hydroxyl group in C-15 of 15-copaenol (6) by an acetyl group (
