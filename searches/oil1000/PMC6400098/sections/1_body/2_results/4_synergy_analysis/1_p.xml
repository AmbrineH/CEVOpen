<p class="p">The results of synergism are shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Tables 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. The MICs of DCME, 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) and 15-copaenol (6) varied in a range of 31.3–125 μg/mL in all strains studied. In general, the MIC values of ciprofloxacin were highest in 
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>
 <sup class="sup">++</sup> (K2378) strain (2 μg/mL) in comparison with Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic> (K1902) strain (0.5 μg/mL), showing ciprofloxacin is substrate of NorA efflux pump. The MIC values of oxacillin did not show significative differences in strains studied (12.5–25 μg/mL). Additionally, was determined that all combinations between DCME extract or pure compounds [
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) or 15-copaenol (6)] with ciprofloxacin or oxacillin decreased MICs values of both antibiotics in tested 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains (
