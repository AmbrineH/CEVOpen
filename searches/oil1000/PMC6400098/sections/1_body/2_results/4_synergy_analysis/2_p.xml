<p class="p">The largest reductions in the MIC value of ciprofloxacin were observed when it was mixed with 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) and 15-copaenol (6), reaching 67-fold reduction of MIC values in wild type strain. While the combinations between DCME, 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4), 15-copaenol (6) and oxacillin reduced the MIC of this antibiotic 4–16 times fold. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values obtained in the checkerboard assays were in the range of 0.0307–0.2637, indicating that all combinations between DCME, 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) or 15-copaenol (6) and tested antibiotics have a synergistic effect (FICI ≤ 0.5) in wild type,
