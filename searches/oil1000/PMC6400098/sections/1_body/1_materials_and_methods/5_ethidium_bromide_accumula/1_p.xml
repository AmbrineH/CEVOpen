<p class="p">The effects of extracts and compounds obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> on the accumulation of EtBr was evaluated in the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> NCTC 8325-4 (wild type), K2378 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) and K1902 (Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>) strains. Sub-inhibitory concentrations (½, ¼, and ⅛ of the MIC) of the study extracts and compounds were used in all experiments, and CCCP was used as an inhibitor control. The assay was carried out according to 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Paixão et al. (2009)</xref>. Briefly, the 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains were grown in 10 mL of LB medium until they reached a mid-log phase, which corresponded to an OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> of 0.6. Then, the bacteria were centrifuged at 10,786 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 3 min, the pellet was washed twice with the same volume of PBS, and the OD
 <sub class="sub">600</sub> of the cellular suspension was adjusted to 0.3. Glucose was added to the cellular suspension to achieve a final concentration of 0.6% (v/v), and aliquots of 95 μL were transferred to 0.2 mL wells in 96-well microtiter plates. Aliquots containing 0.4 μL of EtBr or 0.2 μL of CCCP were then added to obtain final concentrations of 1.0 μg/mL and 1.25 μg/mL of EtBr and CCCP, respectively. Fluorescence (530/580 nm excitation/detection) was monitored by a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HT Model, Winooski, VT, United States) at 37°C every 5 min for a period of 1 h. The effects of the extracts and compounds on the accumulation of EtBr was determined under conditions that optimized efflux (i.e., the presence of glucose and incubation at 37°C). All experiments were performed in triplicate.
