<p class="p">Approximately, 10,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate were seeded in 100 μL of DMEM. The cells were treated separately with eight different concentrations of extract and pure compounds (125–0.5 μg/mL). Simultaneously, growth controls were performed, which consisted of cells incubated with culture medium alone and with 4 μL methanol as solvent control. Finally, treated HeLa cells and the respective controls were incubated for 24 h in 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37°C. All tests were carried out in triplicate. Cell viability was determined by counting live and dead cells after staining with 0.5 μM calcein-AM and 2 μM propidium iodide, for 30 min at room temperature, in darkness. Calcein-AM is a live scoreboard and propidium iodide intercalates into DNA being dead cells cell marker. Cells were visualized at 100× magnification on a Nikon microscope equipped Daipot inverted fluorescent and phase contrast optics. Cells were counted in a phase contrast microscope equipped with fluorescence using the following filters: calcein-AM 510–560 nm (excitation) and 590 nm (emission), propidium iodide 536 nm (excitation) and 617 nm (emission).
