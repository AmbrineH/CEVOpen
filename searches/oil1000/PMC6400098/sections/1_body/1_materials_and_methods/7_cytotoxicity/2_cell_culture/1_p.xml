<p class="p">The HeLa cell line was grown in monolayers in Dulbecco’s modified medium (DMEM; Corning, NY, United States) with bovine fetal serum 10% (FBS) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Corning Eagle, United States) in a modified Thermo Scientific air incubator (5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at 37°C). The medium was renewed every 2 days to reach 80% confluence. Then, the cells were transferred to T75 flasks, grown to reach 80% confluence, and finally, the culture was divided into sterile 24-well plates.
