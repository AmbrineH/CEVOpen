<p class="p">The heartwood EO, PEE and DCME and natural sesquiterpenes (1–6) were analyzed according to previously described methods (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Espinoza et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). The synthetic derivatives 15-copaenyl acetate (6AC) and 15-copaenal (6OX) were analyzed by ATR-FT-IR and 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H- and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 65 spectrometer. Both the 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H- and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 Ultra Shield spectrometer (Bruker-Biospin GmbH, Germany) with the 5 mm NMR tube, using CDCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (99.8% D, contains 0.03% (v/v) TMS, Sigma-Aldrich, United States). 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR spectra were acquired using Bruker pulse program with the following settings: flip angle of 30°; relaxation delay (d1) = 0 s, size of fid = 32768, number of scans = 32, spectral width = 14.983 ppm, acquisition time = 5.4657 s, requested probe temperature = 300.0 K. 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectra were acquired using Bruker pulse program with the following settings: flip angle of 30°; relaxation delay (d11) = 30 ms and (d12) = 20 μs, size of fid = 16384, number of scans = 24166, spectral width = 240.049 ppm, acquisition time = 0.6783 s, requested probe temperature = 300.0 K. All data acquisition and processing were done with MestreNova 6.0.2 (Mestrelab Research, S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Spain).
