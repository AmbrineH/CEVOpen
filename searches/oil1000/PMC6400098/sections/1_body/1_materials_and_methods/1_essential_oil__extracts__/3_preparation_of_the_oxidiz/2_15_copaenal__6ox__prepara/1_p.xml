Compound 6 (60 mg, 0.273 mmol) was diluted in acetone (2.8 mL) and then added to a 10 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was cooled to 0–5°C in an ice bath, and the Jones reagent was added at a constant drip until the colorless reaction mixture took on an orange color. The mixture was diluted with H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (3 × 5.0 mL). The organic layer was cleaned with an NaCl-saturated solution (3 × 5.0 mL) and evaporated to dryness using a rotatory evaporator. The oily residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column, yielding a pale-yellow oil corresponding to 15-copaenal (6OX) (39.6 mg, 0.182 mmol, 66.6%) (
