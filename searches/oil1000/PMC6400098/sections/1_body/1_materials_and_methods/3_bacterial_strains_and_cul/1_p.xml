<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains used in this study were an NCTC 8325-4 parental strain, a K1902 mutant (Δ
 <italic class="italic">nor</italic>A), and a K2378 mutant that overexpressed 
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++) from a multicopy plasmid (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Felicetti et al., 2018</xref>). This strain was produced by cloning 
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic> and its promoter into plasmid pCU1 and then introducing the construct into SA-K1902 (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Augustin et al., 1992</xref>). The bacterial strains were donated by Dr. Glenn Kaatz of the Division of Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, United States, and were stored at the Laboratorio de Microbiología Básica y Aplicada, Universidad de Santiago de Chile. Bacterial cultures were grown in Mueller Hinton (MH) broth (Sigma Aldrich, United States) and Luria-Bertani (LB) (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) medium at 37°C with agitation (220 rpm). 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> K1902 and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> K2378 cultures were supplemented with 10 μg/mL chloramphenicol.
