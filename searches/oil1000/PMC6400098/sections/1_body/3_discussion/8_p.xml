<p class="p">Ferruginol, a diterpene isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Chamaecyparis lawsoniana</italic>, was demonstrated to have an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 17 Î¼M in an EtBr efflux-inhibition assay performed using SA-1199B cells (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yusa and Tsuruo, 1989</xref>). Both reserpine and ferruginol caused a fourfold reduction in the MIC of tetracycline in XU212 cells. Ferruginol also increased the activity of erythromycin by fourfold against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> RN4220 cells (pUL5054; 
 <italic class="italic">msrA</italic>++), suggesting that these cells exhibit a rarely observed MsrA inhibitory activity (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al., 2007a</xref>). It should be noted that ferruginol and other similar compounds, such as 6,7-dehydroferruginol, hinokione, hinokiol, and sugiol, were present in the DCME and PEE isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic>. These compounds could be related to the inhibitory activity of DCME. Totarol, a phenolic diterpene isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Chamaecyparis nootkatensis</italic>, reduced by eightfold the MIC of EtBr against SA-K3092 (
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>++); EtBr efflux was similarly inhibited by reserpine (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al., 2007b</xref>). Interestingly, this concentration of totarol mediated an eightfold reduction in the erythromycin MIC in RN4220 cells (pUL5054), demonstrating that it exerts activity against MsrA (
