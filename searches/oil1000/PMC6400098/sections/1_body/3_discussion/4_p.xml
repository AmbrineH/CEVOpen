<p class="p">The results obtained in synergism assays, are coincident with those previous 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies which showed a synergistic effect between plant extracts and/or isolated compounds with different classes of antibiotics against sensitive and multidrug resistant pathogenic strains. It has also been determined that these combinations reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics in different 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains (
