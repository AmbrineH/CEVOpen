 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oluwatuyi et al. (2004)</xref> demonstrated that the abietane diterpenes, carnosic acid and carnosol, which were isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, had modest EPI activity. Carnosic acid decreased the MIC values of erythromycin against RN4220 (pUL5054; 
 <italic class="italic">msrA</italic>++) by eightfold and caused a twofold decreased in the EtBr MIC against the SA-1199B strain of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, which overexpresses the 
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic> gene that encodes the NorA MDR efflux pump (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), and that of tetracycline against the XU212 strain of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, which possesses the TetK tetracycline efflux protein (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). However, carnosic acid inhibited EtBr efflux in SA-1199B cells, suggesting that it has weak NorA-inhibitory activity. Carnosol was less active than carnosic acid, but when used in combination with tetracycline, it produced a fourfold decrease in the MIC against XU212 cells. The authors mentioned that high diterpene lipophilicity is a unique common characteristic of these factors and concluded that lipophilicity was essential to efflux pump activity in multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. However, in the present study, we found that the lipophilic sesquiterpenes 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-calamenene (1) and cadalene (2) were not NorA EPIs and that these isolates resulted in the highest MIC values in all of the evaluated strains. This finding suggests that other structural factors are needed to produce NorA efflux pump inhibition.
