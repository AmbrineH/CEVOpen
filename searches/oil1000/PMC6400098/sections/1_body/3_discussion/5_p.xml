 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wagner (2011)</xref> have described four mechanisms by how antibiotic synergism with phytoextracts occurs: (a) multi objective effect, which is based on the fact that the action of the phytoextract affect several cellular targets, such as enzymes, receptors and substrates, among others; (b) pharmacokinetic effects based on the fact that components of the phytoextract help the solubility; (c) elimination or neutralization of toxic or adversely acting substances by one agent that has been added to an extract; (d) the interaction of the components of the phytoextract with the resistance mechanisms of the bacteria. Our results showed that DCME extract, 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-cubenol (4) and 15-copaenol (6) can act in synergy with antibiotics with different mechanisms of action. The ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) has as cellular target the DNA gyrase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of DNA, while oxacillin (a Î²-lactam) is involved in the inhibition of the peptidoglycan synthesis (synthesis of the cell wall). Then, these antibiotics in combination with extracts and pure compounds resulting in a multi-objective effect. However, the synergistic effect can be produced by more than one mechanism, for example a multi-objective effect and the inhibition of bacterial resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps.
