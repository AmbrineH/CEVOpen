<p class="p">Extracts and compounds were evaluated as bacterial growth inhibitors against wild type, 
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>-deleted, and 
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>-overexpressing strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. According to 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duarte et al. (2007)</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al. (2008)</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oliveira et al. (2013)</xref> plant extracts can be classified as antibacterial agents according to their MIC values; MIC &lt; 500 μg/mL indicate strong inhibitors, MIC between 600 and 1,500 μg/mL indicate moderate inhibitors, and MIC &gt; 1,600 μg/mL indicate weak inhibitors. Therefore, the EO and extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">P. uviferum</italic> heartwood can be classified as strong inhibitors showing MIC range of 31.3–500 μg/mL in all evaluated 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains. Additionally, the analyses showed that the MIC values were the lowest in the K1902 (Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>) strain. Wild type and K2378 (overexpressing 
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>) 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> possessed high levels of antimicrobial resistance because they were capable of reducing the intracellular antibacterial agent concentration via efflux, which was partly mediated by NorA pumps. These pumps were absent in K1902 norA-deleted (Δ
 <italic class="italic">norA</italic>) cells.
