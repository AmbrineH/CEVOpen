<p class="p">Currently, other types of secondary metabolites have also been suggested to act as EPIs in Gram-positive bacteria. Reserpine (an indole alkaloid), flavones, isoflavones, flavolignans, coumarins, galvanic acid (sesquiterpene-coumarin), porphyrins, and chalcones, among others, have been described as EPIs (

Unfortunately, the substantial structural heterogeneity of those secondary metabolites has not allowed a correlation analysis of the structural requirements of efflux pump inhibition. In addition, none of these potential EPIs has been approved for clinical use, partly because their inhibitory mechanisms have not been clarified (
