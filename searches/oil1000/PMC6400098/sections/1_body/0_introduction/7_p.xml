<p class="p">Extracts and compounds obtained from plants, such as efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), have been shown to exert efficient activity and therefore constitute a friendly strategy for controlling 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Therefore, the present study focuses on the ability of essential oils (EOs), extracts and compounds isolated from the heartwood of 
 <italic class="italic">Pilgerodendron uviferum</italic> (D. Don) Florin (Cupressaceae) and synthetic derivatives to inhibit ejection via the NorA efflux pump in a modified strain of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, norA++</italic>, which overexpresses the genes that encode the NorA efflux pump.
