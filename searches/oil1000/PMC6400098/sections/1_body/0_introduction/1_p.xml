<p class="p">Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing health problems worldwide due to the continuous appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Antibiotics decrease or attack bacterial pathogens by altering the functions of the bacterial cell wall, proteins, nucleic acids and metabolic pathways. Antibiotic resistance can occur via several mechanisms: (i) the modification of the active site of the target resulting in reduced drug-binding efficiency, (ii) the direct destruction or modification of the antibiotic drug by enzymes belonging to the microorganism, and (iii) the expression of efflux pumps (
