 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> is a human bacterial pathogen that belongs to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> and is characterized by Gram-positive cocci capable of living under aerobic to facultative anaerobic conditions (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>). Morphologically, they have a diameter ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 Î¼m and can be found singly or in pairs, tetrads, short chains, and irregular grape-like clusters. Additionally, they are non-motile, non-spore-forming and occasionally may contain a polysaccharide capsule. With regard for their biochemical characteristics, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> secretes coagulases, ferments mannitol to lactic acid, and reduces nitrates to nitrites (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>). These bacteria are normally found in human microflora at multiple body sites, such as the skin, perineum, nares, axillae, and gastrointestinal tract, in which approximately 18 strains can share a benign or commensal relationship with the host. Nevertheless, under pathogenic conditions, these bacteria are very difficult to treat due to their strong ability to produce virulence factors, rapidly colonize the host and develop drug resistance (

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> can assume a pathogenic lifestyle in the host cell after entering via a medical implantation or syringe inoculation under hospital conditions (
