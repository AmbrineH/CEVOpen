<p class="p">Genomic DNA of the three soil samples were isolated and extracted using the soil DNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocols. The DNA extracts were stored at −20°C for the PCR amplification (95°C for 5 min, followed by 27 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min) which was performed in an ABI GeneAmp 9700 (USA). The fungal rDNA-ITS region was amplified using universal primers ITS1F (5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′) and ITS2R (5′-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3′) where barcode is an eight-base sequence unique to each sample. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate 20
