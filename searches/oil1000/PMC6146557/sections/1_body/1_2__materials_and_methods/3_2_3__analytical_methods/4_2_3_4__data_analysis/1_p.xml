 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] for further analysis. After removing the adaptors, primers and low-quality reads, the pair-end reads were overlapped to assemble the final sequences using the FLASH software. The criterions of overlapping were that the overlapping lengths were &gt;10 bp and the default threshold values were ≤0.2. Chimera tags were further filtered out using the Gold database by UCHIME (version 4.2.40), and finally the effective tags were generated. The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis was performed using the Uparse package (version 7.0.1001) with a 97% sequence identity. Each OTU was taxonomically assigned to the UNITE database using the ribosomal database project (RDP) classifier. OTUs were processed by removing chloroplast sequences, chondriosome sequences, and unclassified sequences. Finally, the OTUs with relative abundance of above 1% were retained.
