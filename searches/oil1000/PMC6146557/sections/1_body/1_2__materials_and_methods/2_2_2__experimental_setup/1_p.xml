<p class="p">An AOS spot around an oil well drilled 4 years ago with the approximate diameter of 40 cm was selected. Two soil samples at the horizontal center of AOS spot were collected from 0 cm and 20 cm vertically below the surface of soil, respectively (labeled as S1 and S2). Then, another soil sample obtained from the surface soil and 120 m away from the AOS center without oily sludge surroundings was chosen as blank (labeled as S3, uncontaminated soil sample) (

Those soil samples were divided into two parts. One part was used for the determination of physicochemical properties, HMs and TPHs (air-dried and processed with a 100-mesh sieve). The other part was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing.
