<p class="p">Oil sludge is one of the most significant hazardous solid wastes generated in oil industry in China [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. It was mainly generated from the process of drilling, exploitation, transportation, refining, and storage of crude oil. A large amount of oil sludge consisted of many hazardous chemicals, such as petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) and heavy metals (HMs), which are of great concern for the potential toxicity to human, have been emitted into the local environment [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. On the receiving soils, the toxic components in oil sludge may cause nutrient deficiency or limit the growth of seed and plants [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Oil sludge was stacked in the open air with continually decreasing of volatile components (mainly some light oil components) and moisture content, generating quantities of aged oil sludge (AOS) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. As time passed, the hazardous chemicals in AOS were continuously emitted into the local environment, resulting in chronic pollution effects on the receiving soil. Compared with oil sludge, AOS has the characteristics of higher heavy oil content, longer pollution period, and less comprehensive utilization [
