<p class="p">This is the first study that took fungi as the typical indicators of pollution to evaluate the microbial variations in soil caused by AOS. In this study, an AOS site of 4 years on soil was selected as the point source pollution of sampling, in which the fungal diversity and community structure in soil were explored with the method of high-throughput sequencing technique. This study is aimed at evaluating the influence from AOS on physicochemical properties, fungal community structure, and diversity in soil, as well as screening dominant or core oil-resistant fungal genera for potential use in soil bioremediation. The results and related findings would aid in thorough understanding of microorganism structure in oil-contaminated soil and provide new point of view to soil bioremediation.</p>
