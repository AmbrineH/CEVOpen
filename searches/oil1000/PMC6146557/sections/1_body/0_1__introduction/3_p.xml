<p class="p">In recent decades, within the various biological techniques, high-throughput sequencing technology with better capacity for detecting rare species [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] is identified as a highly efficient tool for researching the entire profile of microorganism community [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. It has been proved that soil microorganisms are far more sensitive to pollution than soil, animals, or plants [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], with the evidence that the microorganisms in oil-contaminated soil are obviously different from those in background soil [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Some domain bacteria phyla like 
 <italic class="italic">proteobacteria</italic> are found in different contaminated receptors, such as soil [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and activated sludge [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. However, as a good indicator of pollution, fungal diversity in contaminated soil is rarely reported.
