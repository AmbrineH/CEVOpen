<p class="p">This is the first study that evaluated the significant effects on physicochemical properties and fungal diversities of soil caused by AOS contamination. The results revealed that longtime oil exposure made the receiving soil arid, saline-alkali, and unsuitable for agriculture. The contents of both TPHs and HMs in the contaminated soils were apparently increased compared with noncontaminated soil. High-throughput sequencing results by Miseq platform showed significant changes in fungi community compositions and diversities. It was observed that oily circumstance could limit the growth of most genera and meanwhile promote the growth of certain oil-resistant fungi like

 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic>), and

 <italic class="italic">Basidiomycota</italic>). In particular, there were three new-appeared genera in aged oil sludge-contaminated soils, among which 
 <italic class="italic">Cephalotheca</italic> was identified as the core genus with the highest abundance of 16.76% in all the retained genera. The results could present a thorough understanding of microbial diversity in oil-contaminated soil and a better insight into the soil bioremediation.
