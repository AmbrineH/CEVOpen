<p class="p">The analysis of multiple samples shown as cluster tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>) demonstrated that the three samples were divided into two clusters. S1 and S2 were clustered together, indicating a more similar fungi community structures and diversities. While as noncontaminated sample, S3 was divided into a separated group, implying distinguishing structures and diversities of fungi communities from the contaminated soils. Furthermore, the two clusters were well separated, which suggested a clear distinction of the fungi community structures and diversities between the two clusters [
