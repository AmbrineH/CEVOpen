<p class="p">Further analysis was carried out to analyze the fungal community composition in family levels. In general, 91.83% of the total sequences were assigned and there were 28 identified families with the relative abundance of above 1%. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, S1 and S2 had similar family structures and diversities. In the noncontaminated soil (S3), the top three abundant families were Mortierellaceae (13.46%), Aspergi laceae (11.32%), and Meruliaceae (9.33%). While in contaminated soils, the growth of the above families was powerfully limited and their percentages in S1 reduced to 5.58%, 10.76%, and even 0.00%, respectively. In contrast, the proportion of certain families was significantly increased in contaminated soils compared with S3, such as Cephalothecaceae, Cordycipitaceae, Pleosporaceae, and Thelephoraceae. Especially the family of Cephalothecaceae, as the largest family among all the identified families, it was a new-appeared fungal family in contaminated soils with the abundance of 16.76% in S1 and 12.63% in S2. The family Cephalothecaceae in Sordariomycetes (Ascomycota) was incertae sedis [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] because of uncertain phylogenetic placement and differing morphology [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. In addition, Cordycipitaceae and Pleosporaceae are members of Ascomycota, while Thelephoraceae belongs in Basidiomycota.
