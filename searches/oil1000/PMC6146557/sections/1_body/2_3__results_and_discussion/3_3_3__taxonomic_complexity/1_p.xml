<p class="p">The fungal community compositions of the three soil samples reflected similar diversities but different abundances. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref"> Figure 4</xref> provided the fungal community information in phylum level. Among the total 6 identified phyla, 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic> was the most abundant phylum followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Basidiomycota</italic> in all samples. 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic> has been reported as the largest phylum by far with over 64,000 identified species in almost 6400 genera [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and the most typical dominant phylum in soil [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In this study, 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic> accounted for 63.67% of total DNA sequences in the noncontaminated soil (S3). While in the contaminated soil samples, the percentage of 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic> increased to 71.58% in S1 and 70.08% in S2, indicating that oily sludge was beneficial to the existence of 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic>. According to Aranda [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], PAH-polluted soils were found to be colonized mostly by 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic> and indigenous ascomycete was able to transform or remove PAHs. PAHs are the main components of the hydrocarbons in AOS. Therefore, it might explain the enrichment of 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic> in soils after long-term AOS exposure. The 
 <italic class="italic">Basidiomycota</italic> has been recognized as prominent tool for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants due to their rich supply of laccase, tyrosinase, and soluble extracellular enzymes, such as lignin-modifying enzyme (LME) [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In this study, we observed a decrease of the percentage of 
 <italic class="italic">Basidiomycota</italic> (by −2.46% in S1 and −6.26% in S2) in contaminated soils compared with S3 (15.13%). Although the growth was limited, 
 <italic class="italic">Basidiomycota</italic> was still the second largest phyla in the contaminated soils.
