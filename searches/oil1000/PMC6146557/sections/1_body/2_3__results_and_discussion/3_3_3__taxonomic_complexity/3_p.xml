<p class="p">The relative fungal abundance at genus level was also analyzed. Totally, 39 genera with the abundance of above 1% were classified in the samples. It was observed that the growth of most identified genera was limited, with the possible reason that AOS discharged TPHs into the receiving soil. TPHs comprised hydrogen and carbon, but lack of nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus essential for microbial growth [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. As the dominant fungi in S3, the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Mortierella</italic> (13.46%), 
 <italic class="italic">Emericella</italic> (10.77%), and 
 <italic class="italic">Bjerkandera</italic> (9.33%) presented a decreased dynamic to 12.74%, 2.08%, and 0.00% in S1, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5(a)</xref>), while 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cephalotheca</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Lecanicillium</italic> with the abundances of 5.31%, 12.63%, and 1.74% in S1 was found oil-tolerant (the relative abundances in S3 were 0.05%, 0.00%, and 0.00%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5(b)</xref>). In general, there were three new genera (
 <italic class="italic">Cephalotheca</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Lecanicillium</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Septoriella</italic>) which did not exist in noncontaminated soil (0.00%), and another three genera (
 <italic class="italic">Venturia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Piloderma</italic>) almost not found in S3 of which the percentage was below 0.1% of the total genera. 
 <italic class="italic">Cephalotheca</italic> was the genus of fungi in the 
 <italic class="italic">Cephalothecaceae</italic> family of the 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic>. It was the core genus with high abundance of 12.63% (in S1) and 16.70% (in S2) in AOS-contaminated soils. 
 <italic class="italic">Lecanicillium</italic> is well known as entomopathogenic fungal species. Temperature between 10 and 25°C and higher moisture are benefit to conidial germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Lecanicillium</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Considering that the average temperature of Shengli oilfield was 12.9°C, and the AOS-contaminated soils had higher moisture contents than noncontaminated soil (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), it might be the reason for the appearance of 
 <italic class="italic">Lecanicillium</italic>. Furthermore, 
 <italic class="italic">Septoriella</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Venturia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic> were the genera of fungi in 
 <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Piloderma</italic> was the genus of fungi in 
 <italic class="italic">Basidiomycota</italic> that could adapt oily circumstance. They are the promising fungi genera that could be used in bioremediation of aged oil contamination in the future.
