<p class="p">The rarefaction analysis was used to verify whether the volume or the depth of sampling was sufficient to capture the existing OTUs [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, the three soil samples generally had the same patterns of rarefaction curves that showed a trend to level off, indicating a sufficient sampling of the fungal species. The Venn diagram was used to analyze the species composition by evaluating the distribution of fungal community. It could provide direct expression of the similarity and overlapping numbers of OTUs between different samples. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the numbers of OTUs in S1, S2, and S3 were 475, 557, and 565, separately, among which 240 OTUs accounted for 73.09% of the total sequences were shared, and 168 OUTs in S1 and 219 OTUs in S2 were unique, respectively, after AOS exposure. Meanwhile, comparing to S3, 160 OTUs disappeared in the contaminated soils. Therefore, AOS affected the richness of fungal community and changed fungal diversity to a certain extent.
