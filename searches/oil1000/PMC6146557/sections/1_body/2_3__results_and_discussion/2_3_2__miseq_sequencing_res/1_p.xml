<p class="p">By amplifying the ITS region of fungi, Illumina high-throughput sequencing which adopted a sequencing-by-synthesis approach [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] enabled thorough identification of fungal community structures, including those that could not be cultured or detected in traditional approaches [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Totally, 96,331 valid sequences of the ITS gene were obtained with an average length of 241 bp. RDP classifier was used in hierarchical clustering analysis at the similarity threshold of 97%. The sequence information and fungal diversity indexes are listed in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The numbers of OTUs, Ace, Chao 1, the Shannon-Weaver indexes, and Simpson indexes of the three samples showed obvious change after AOS exposure. The numbers of OTUs, Ace, and Chao1 indexes reduced from S3 to S2 and S1, indicating less OTUs and species richness in contaminated soils [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. S1 had the lowest Shannon-Weaver index (4.36) and the highest Simpson index (0.0467), suggested smallest fungal community diversity [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. While the Shannon-Weaver index (4.61) and Simpson index (0.0355) of S2 reflected the biggest fungal community diversity. The Good's coverage estimator was used to assess the sampling completeness, obtaining the results of above 0.999, indicating an appropriate reveal of most fungal diversity in all samples [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>].
