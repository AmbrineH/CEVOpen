<p class="p">As a result of its high viscosity, aged oil sludge can be fixed in soil pores or adsorbed onto the surface of soil mineral constituents, causing reduction of water retention capacity and hydraulic conductivity of the soil [

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. It was observed that the pH values of the three soil samples ranged from 8.11 to 8.56. The salinity of S1 (0.27%) and S2 (0.36%) was much lower than that of S3 (1.45%) which indicated a higher biomass in the AOS-contaminated soil [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The total organic carbon (TOC) in S1 and S2 was much higher than that in S3 due to the oil input. The moisture contents in S1 (21.05%) and S2 (22.55%) were generally higher compared with S3 (13.95%) which was inconsistent with previous studies [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Therefore, the soil around AOS discharged was arid and saline-alkali soil; meanwhile, its physical and chemical properties were significantly changed by AOS. It has been demonstrated that differences in edaphic properties, such as pH and moisture, are often associated with differences in soil fungal communities, not only in richness but also in composition and structure [
