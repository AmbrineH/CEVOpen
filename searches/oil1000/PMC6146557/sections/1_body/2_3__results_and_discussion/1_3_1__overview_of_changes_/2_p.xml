<p class="p">Along with the emission of oil sludge to the receiving soil, the contents of TPHs and HMs were intensively increased. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Cr in S1 were approximately the same with those in S2, while 6.3, 8.4, and 2.2 times of those in S3, respectively (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and have higher toleration to metal pollutants than bacteria [

While in S3, there was no (or under detection limit of method) TPHs detected. Higher concentrations of TPHs have been reported showing stronger toxic effects on the activity of soil enzymes and microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Furthermore, it was found that there was joint toxic effect between PAHs and HMs in AOS-contaminated soil, which was studied by our research group.
