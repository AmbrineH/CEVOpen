 <p class="p">The oilfield soil was contaminated for years by large quantities of aged oil sludge generated in the petroleum industry. In this study, physicochemical properties, contents of main pollutants, and fungal diversity of the aged oil sludge-contaminated soil were analyzed. Results revealed that aged oil sludge significantly changed physical and chemical properties of the receiving soil and increased the contents of main pollutants (petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals) in soil. Meanwhile, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing by Illumina Miseq platform at each taxonomic level demonstrated that the toxicological effect of oil pollutants obviously influenced the fungal diversity and community structure in soil. Moreover, it was found that the presence of three genera (
  <italic class="italic">Cephalotheca</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Lecanicillium</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Septoriella</italic>) appeared in aged oil sludge-contaminated soil. And oil pollutants promoted the growth of certain genera in 
  <italic class="italic">Ascomycota</italic> (70.83%) and 
  <italic class="italic">Basidiomycota</italic> (10.78%), such as 
  <italic class="italic">Venturia</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Alternaria</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Piloderma</italic>. Nevertheless, the growth of 
  <italic class="italic">Mortierella</italic> (9.16%), 
  <italic class="italic">Emericella</italic> (6.02%), and 
  <italic class="italic">Bjerkandera</italic> (0.00%) was intensively limited. This study would aid thorough understanding of microbial diversity in oil-contaminated soil and thus provide new point of view to soil bioremediation.
