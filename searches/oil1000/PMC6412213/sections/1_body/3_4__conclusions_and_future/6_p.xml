<p class="p">A major problem with research on natural substances and their products is in the standardisation, as it is difficult to compare results from different laboratories. This is especially important when effects associated with natural plants are studied. They contain many substances, which may induce diverse biological effects, depending not only on the phenotype and genotype of the target object, but also on the location of their growth, as soil and air composition may contribute to the composition of plant tissue. Moreover, it should be considered that the effect induced by a single product isolated from a plant may have little to do with the effects evoked by the total extract of that plant. Therefore, two basic methods can be considered—isolation and purification of a single product from a plant, and the use of its extract. The former is relatively simple to standardise: The degree of purity should be established, along with a maximal allowed concentration of specific impurities. Standardisation of the extraction procedure is much more complex, and it should include determination of the part of a plant, its age, development, soil composition, climate, season, chemicals added, and so on. Therefore, the only way to follow these requirements is to cultivate a plant in optimal, determined conditions, but then, such conditions must be regulated, and the plant is no longer “natural”. </p>
