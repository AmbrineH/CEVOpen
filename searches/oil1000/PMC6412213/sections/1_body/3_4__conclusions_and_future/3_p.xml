<p class="p">SCE phytochemicals are involved in carbohydrate- and lipid-metabolism regulation. The presented review updates knowledge on the molecular mechanisms in which SCE lignans, polyphenols, and polysaccharides are implicated (e.g., in the regulation of transcriptional factors and enzyme activities, or the selective inhibition of glucose transporters). The anti-diabetic and anti-obesity abilities of SCE can be recommended in the prevention or control of metabolic disorders, in the form of a programmed dietary supplement or functional food component. </p>
