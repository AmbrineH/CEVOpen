<p class="p">As the human microbiome is a potential mediator of the influence of dietary intake on metabolic status, little attention has been given to the role of SCE in the modulation of the human gut microbiota, and thus, the subsequent pro-health effects. In one randomised study, an increased abundance of the genus

As the composition of the intestinal microbiota considerably changes with aging and the related disease outcomes, it is important to determine the role of SCE in these processes. As metabolism of plant extracts by human gut microbiota has become a subject of extensive investigation, the future perspective is in the isolation, identification, and estimation of the biological activity of the metabolites of SCE released after digestion in the human GI tract, and also after supplementation with probiotic bacteria.
