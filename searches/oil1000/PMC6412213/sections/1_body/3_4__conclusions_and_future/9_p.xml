<p class="p">The beneficial effects of SCE on physical endurance, assessed as the extension of the time taken to continuously swim or run, should be more closely associated with its effect on energy production [
 <xref rid="B102-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. It seems that PGC-1Î±, a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, is a candidate to interact with SCE to promote more effective physical efforts, but further studies on that subject are needed, as PGC-1a fulfils many important functions, including antioxidant defence [

 <xref rid="B126-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. Therefore, the beneficial effect of SCE on physical activity would be associated with directed energy production and distribution, as well as with the fighting of fatigue-induced oxidative stress through interaction with PGC-1a, but this hypothesis needs further verification.
