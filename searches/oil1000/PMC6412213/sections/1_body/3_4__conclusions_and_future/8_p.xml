<p class="p">An apparent lack of side effects or cumulative action is often mentioned as a major advantage of SCE use. It was stated that SCE extracts in ethanol are non-toxic for experimental animals, even at very high doses [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, most in vitro research on the beneficial effects of SCE in a disease is performed on normal or cancer cell lines, and the target disease is modelled by introducing elements of its pathogenesis. This is not a reliable model to investigate the human response to toxic doses of SCE in various pathologies. Moreover, interaction of SCE with other drugs should also be investigated to avoid unwanted effects.
