<p class="p">Cognitive and behavioural functions are also reported to be improved by SCE. These properties are, in general, associated with antioxidant effects and an improvement of energy metabolism in the brain [

Therefore, model cells and animals for the study of neurodegenerative diseases can be suitable for research on some aspects of such beneficial aspects of SCE. However, there are some problems with establishing the causative relationship between the reason and consequences of oxidative stress and annotating the influence of SCE. These functions, in improving cognitive and behavioural functions, are closely associated with the anti-aging functions of SCE, as many degenerative diseases and defects are age-related.
