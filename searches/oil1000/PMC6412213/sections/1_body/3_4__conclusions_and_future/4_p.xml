<p class="p">SCE can also exert several effects that can be interpreted as the expression of its anti-aging properties. However, the influence of this compound on normal life-span has not been studied thus far. Moreover, in many experiments, the anti-aging effects of SCE can be concluded based on aging markers of various specificity. Therefore, indicators that are more aging-specific could be subjected to further research. Furthermore, most of the anti-aging effects attributed to SCE are associated with its antioxidant properties, but the process of aging—both normal and accelerated—should not be limited to the increased production of ROS.</p>
