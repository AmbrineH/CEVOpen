<p class="p">The role of SCE in cellular reaction to oxidative stress appears to be especially important in its biomedical applications. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, and can be associated with many environmental/life style factors [

 <xref rid="B123-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>]. However, antioxidant enzymes are not the only components of cellular antioxidant defence. Low-molecular weight antioxidants and DNA repair are other elements of that system, and little is known about SCEâ€™s influence on them. Moreover, it is not completely known whether some chemical components of SCE have the ability to directly scavenge ROS through their chemical inactivation. Choi showed that schisandrin A prevented DNA damage, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by hydrogen peroxide, and these effects could be associated with lowering the H

 <xref rid="B124-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. However, it was not determined which mechanism was directly responsible for that lowering. Moreover, it was shown, in that work, that schisandrin A lowered the extent of the phosphorylated h2AX histone, which is a marker of the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Therefore, a multifaceted action of schisandrin A against genotoxic effects could be considered, and it is important in future research to keep that in mind and not to limit the report to only final or intermediate consequences of the antioxidant effects of SCE. These three main elements of cellular antioxidant defence: Antioxidant enzymes, low-molecular weight antioxidants, and DNA repair, should be considered and investigated in the context of the antioxidant action of SCE, starting from its ability to directly inactivate a stress-inductor without the involvement of any cellular structure.
