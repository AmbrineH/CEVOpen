This protection was underlined by a reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±), an inhibited expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, and increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and a C-telopeptide of type II collagen.
