<p class="p">Sarcopenia, a progressive loss of muscle strength and mass with aging, is commonly considered as an important indicator of normal aging and occurs in some diseases associated with accelerated aging [
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. SCE was shown to increase mass of skeletal muscle in mice and rats treated by dexamethasone or that underwent sciatic neurectomy [
 <xref rid="B102-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>,
 <xref rid="B103-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="B104-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. To explore the mechanisms beyond these effects, Kim et al. showed that SCE ameliorated muscle atrophy by increased protein synthesis resulting from downregulation of the mTOR/p-4E-BP1 (4E-binding protein1)/p-P70S6K (70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase) pathway in human myoblasts [
 <xref rid="B106-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. However, SCE can also promote protein degradation through the FOXO1/MuRF1 pathway, but its net action resulted in muscle hypertrophy. A former work of Kang adds some information on this mechanism, pointing at heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and Nrf2, which can be targeted by SCE in C2C12 myoblasts [
 <xref rid="B107-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. As aging compromises muscle mass, amelioration of these effects by SCE can be considered as a manifestation of its anti-aging potential. In their recent work, Kim et al. showed that SCE upregulated genes whose products are important in protein synthesis and muscle growth in old mice after chronic forced exercises (swimming) [
 <xref rid="B108-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. Additionally, SCE downregulated genes important for protein degradation. SCE also reduced the levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation, as well as upregulating some antioxidant enzymes and inhibited certain apoptotic markers. Therefore, SCE can be considered as an element to assist an exercise-based, healthy life style. Similar conclusions can be drawn from the experiments showing that omija fruit extract as a diet supplement improved the running endurance of rats [
 <xref rid="B102-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. That work also showed an upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1Î±), and some other proteins in the skeletal muscle of trained animals.
