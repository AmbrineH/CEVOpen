<p class="p">Organismal aging is determined by many factors besides the date of birth, but cellular senescence can be an important element of aging and age-related diseases [

 <xref rid="B94-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Several physiological and pathological conditions are subjects of aging research, including senescence, direct aging, photoaging, oxidative, mitochondrial, and inflammatory aging, among others. To study aging in experimental practice, either cellular replicative senescence is investigated or various animal models of aging are used. D-galactose-induced aging is one (if not the most) commonly applied model of aging [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. However, it should be considered as a model of accelerated, rather than physiological, aging. It is out of the scope of this review to consider conceptions and models of aging. Instead, some effects of SCE in biological systems, which can be related to aging, will be considered.
