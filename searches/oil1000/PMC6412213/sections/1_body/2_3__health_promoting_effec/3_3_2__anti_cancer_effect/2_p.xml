 <italic class="italic">Schisandra</italic> extracts or its constituents in normal cell lines, compared to their cancer counterparts. Kee et al., demonstrated the anti-cancer activity of gomisin A, through inhibition of proliferation of several colorectal cancer cell lines, whereas that compound did not change the proliferation of normal colon cells [

In in vitro studies, schisandrin B inhibited the invasion and migration of the human alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) by down-regulating the expressions of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) [
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Then, gomisin A reduced invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cell lines, as well as the metastasis in BALB/c mouse lung [

The research relevant to mechanisms of cytotoxicity and apoptosis of SCE in cancer cells is advanced, while data on normal cells are limited and in vivo data are insufficient.
