<p class="p">The major and essential adipogenesis regulator is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00333-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Insulin sensitizers are its agonists, able to increase triacylglycerol storage in adipose tissues by increasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) is another important transcriptional factor involved in lipid metabolism. Activation of PPAR-γ and SREBP-1c regulates the expression of other genes which encode proteins responsible for fat cell development, considered as a positive effect that will stimulate β-oxidation, insulin sensitivity, adiponectin secretion, glucose uptake, and catabolism. It was demonstrated that SCE fruit extract, enriched with schisandrin, gomisin A, and angeloylgomisin H, acted as a PPAR-γ agonist and improved insulin resistance in the liver [

However, further studies showed that SCE extract and its lignans prevented lipid accumulation and impaired the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, via downregulation of the key adipocyte differentiation regulatory genes
