<p class="p">Chronic excessive lipid accumulation in the liver leads to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It was shown that a SCE water extract lowered hepatic triglyceride, total cholesterol, glucose content, and ameliorated ALT (alanine aminotransferase) release by a liver injured by fenofibrate (a PPARα agonist) in normal and hypercholesteraemic mice [
 <xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Recent studies demonstrated that a SCE ethanol extract attenuated palmitic acid and oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation in human hepatoma HepG2 cells [

Zhu et al., showed that SCE decreased the expression of ER stress markers and inflammatory genes encoding Il-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 proteins, whereas Chung et al. revealed that SCE berry ethanol extract ameliorated lipid accumulation by the inhibition of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) through the inhibition of total lysine acetylation [

The hepatoprotective activity of SCE was also revealed by a polysaccharide fraction, which downregulated mRNA and protein expression of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC, and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in mice with induced NAFLD. In addition, gomisin N, derived from SCE, activated AMPK phosphorylation in steatotic HepG2 cells, which consequently led to LXR restrain, deactivation of ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) via phosphorylation, and the prevention of SREBP-1c translocation [
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. In the presented pathway, active LXRα, after binding to the retinoid X receptor (RXR), stimulates the expression of SREBP-1c and its target lipogenesis genes by binding to LXR response elements in their promoters [
