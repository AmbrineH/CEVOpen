<p class="p">Obesity is characterised by the accumulation of excess fat in adipose tissues, and its development occurs along with the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. This process is known as adipogenesis, and can be observed in vitro by the increased ability of adipocytes to accumulate triacylglycerol in cytosolic lipid droplets. Schisandrin B reduced lipid content, as well as increased acid oxidation and lipolysis, with the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [

In an in vivo experiment, schisandrin B reduced subcutaneous adipocytes size, subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, and the body weight in mice.
