<p class="p">The liver plays a major role in maintaining normal blood glucose levels by regulating 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> glucose production and glycogen breakdown. Hepatic insulin resistance results in the elevation of hepatic glucose production and triglyceride (TG) accumulation (by impairing insulin-mediated inhibition of gluconeogenesis and regulating insulin-mediated TG metabolism, respectively), which contributes to hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. Therefore, the control of hepatic insulin resistance is an attractive therapeutic target for treating T2D and hepatic steatosis. Studies, performed on hamsters treated with a high fat diet, showed that SCE ethanol extract decreased food and energy intakes, lowered body and fat weights (as well as the serum TG and LDL levels), insulin resistance, inflammation, and liver steatosis [

At the protein level, the extract considerably increased the AMPK phosphorylation (pAMPK), which activated cellular lipid oxidation allowing ATP generation with the simultaneous exclusion of energy-consuming processes, such as TG and protein synthesis [
