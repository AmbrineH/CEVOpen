<p class="p">One of the main features of T2D is a chronic elevation of blood glucose level, known as postprandial hyperglycaemia. Predominantly after meal intake, glucose is released from carbohydrates in the digestive tract. That reaction is catalysed primarily by α-amylase, which hydrolyses starch to maltose and maltotriose, as well as α-glucosidase, which catalyses glucose release from disaccharides and oligosaccharides [

Jo et al., checked in vitro the inhibitory potential of two SCE water polyphenolic extracts, fruit pulp, or skin and seeds and demonstrated that the former was a potent inhibitor of porcine pancreatic α-amylase and rat intestinal α-glucosidase (

These hypoglycaemic properties were confirmed further, during in vivo studies, when a SCE preparation decreased blood glucose level in rats after sucrose solution oral administration, with an efficiency higher than observed for acarbose—a known α-glucosidase inhibitor.
