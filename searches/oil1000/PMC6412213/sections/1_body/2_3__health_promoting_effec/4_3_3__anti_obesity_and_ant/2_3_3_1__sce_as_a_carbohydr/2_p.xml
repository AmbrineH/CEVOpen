<p class="p">Blood glucose level is strongly influenced by its transport and absorption in the small intestine and reabsorption in the kidneys, as well as uptake in other peripheral tissues. In these processes, two types of membrane-integrated transporters, known as glucose transporters (GLUTs) or sodium glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), are involved [
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. SGLT1 is involved in intestinal glucose absorption, whereas SGLT2 and SGLT1 take part in the renal reabsorption of filtered glucose from the primary urine. In diabetic patients, due to the elevated levels of SGLT2 expression, there is increased renal glucose reabsorption leading to hyperglycaemia. Therefore, inhibitors of SGLT2 transporters are considered as potential diabetes treatments. Data presented by Qu et al., showed that the fraction obtained from SCE fruit ethanol extract enriched with lignans—deoxyschisandrin, schisandrin B, and schisandrin—selectively inhibited glucose reuptake by SGLT2, which finally eliminated glucose excess via urine, leading to a decrease in blood glucose level [

 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Among known GLUTs responsible for the uptake of different monosaccharides, the GLUT4 isoform is the principal protein involved in glucose transport into insulin-sensitive tissues [
 <xref rid="B76-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. In T2D patients, the cellular expression of GLUT4 is reduced, indicating a lower capability to process glucose in vivo [
 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. GLUT4 is mainly expressed in muscle cells and adipocytes, but it has been recently found in other types of cells [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. It has been shown that a low molecular weight polysaccharide fraction extracted from SCE up-regulates the expression of GLUT4 in fibroblasts of hepatic origin (Buffalo Rat Liver) and improves glucose uptake [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. However, cellular glucose uptake by the GLUT4 transporter requires translocation from intracellular space to the plasma membrane and is regulated by 5’-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. AMPK is one of the most important regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism, and is regarded as a potential target in the prevention and treatment of diabetes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00333-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). AMPK is activated via its phosphorylation under metabolic stress, when ATP consumption and the AMP:ATP ratio increase. Jin et al. have confirmed that the hypoglycaemic activity of SCE polysaccharides was associated with the increase of pAMPK protein level, as well as the mRNA of

On the other hand, dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 by another enzyme, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), interrupts the insulin signalling pathway. Thus, PTP1B inhibitors increase insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and a petroleum ether extract of SCE was recognised as a PTP1B phosphatase inhibitor [
