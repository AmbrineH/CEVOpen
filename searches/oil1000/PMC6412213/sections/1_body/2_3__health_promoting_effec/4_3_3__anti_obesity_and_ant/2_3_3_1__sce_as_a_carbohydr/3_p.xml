<p class="p">Pancreatic beta cells secreting insulin play a critical role in glucose homeostasis. Due to an intrinsic low level and the minimal activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), these cells are very sensitive to oxidative stress induced by elevated levels of glucose and free fatty acids [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00333-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the high antioxidant activity and radical-scavenging capacity of SCE extracts play an important role in the protection of beta cells against their dysfunction or death [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. It was observed, in diabetic rats, that SCE oil supplementation improved pancreatic Î²-cells function by upregulation of SOD and CAT, along with the expression of the anti-apoptotic

 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Moreover, due to the hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress, the impairment of insulin release from granules by beta cells and loss of pancreatic mass were observed [

Insulin acts as an agonist for insulin receptors (IR), and in turn, activates further glucose uptake by other peripheral tissues, including adipocytes, via GLUT4. A water extract of SCE showed insulinotropic action to improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by mouse Min6 cells [
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. However, further analysis on diabetic rats, subjected to overnight fasting, suggested that a SCE preparation improved glucose homeostasis by the promotion of insulin sensitivity, but not secretion capacity [
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. In accordance with that conclusion, recent studies demonstrated SCE protective activity against the production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are harmful to endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-00333" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. AGEs are produced through non-enzymatic reactions during hyperglycaemia and promote ROS production, which attenuates the expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to a reduced NO level, endothelium dysfunction, and finally to the formation of atheromatous plaques. It was shown that human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cell incubation with SCE elevated the expression and activity of eNOS, via downregulation of RhoA/Rho kinase activity; therefore, SCE was able to reduce hyperglycaemia-induced microvascular complications [
