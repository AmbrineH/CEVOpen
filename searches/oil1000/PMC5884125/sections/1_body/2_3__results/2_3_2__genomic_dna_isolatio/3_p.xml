<p class="p">The sequences were aligned with the closely related species sequences from NCBI nucleotide blast. The branches with bootstrap values above 70% are reliable. The dendrogram was made using ML (maximum likelihood) method, which assumes every single site of the multiple sequence alignment independently with bootstrapping of 1000 replications. The ln likelihood for the cladogram was âˆ’6866.09722. The closer the value of likelihood to zero, the better is the dendrogram (
