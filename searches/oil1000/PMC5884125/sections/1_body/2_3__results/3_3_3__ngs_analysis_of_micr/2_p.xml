<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-diversity measures of the samples were done in QIIME pipeline and Past3. Shannon index (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>′) and Simpson index (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>) were calculated for all the samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), which revealed that the species richness and relative abundance were present in all the samples, soil sample 2 being with the least diversity.
