<p class="p">Rarefaction curves with chao1 and Shannon diversity were plotted with the average number of OTUs at each interval against the size of the subsample [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). It was found that, for all the 10 soil samples, the curve reached a plateau at approximately 5000 sequences indicating that sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the full scope of microbial diversity.
