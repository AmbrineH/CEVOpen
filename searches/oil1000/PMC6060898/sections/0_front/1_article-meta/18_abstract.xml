 <p class="p">Different from cooking oils which contain long‐chain fatty acids, virgin coconut oil (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">VCO</styled-content>) has high medium‐chain fatty acids, making it a potential functional food which can provide some health benefits. In this study, our objective is to investigate the physicochemical properties, antioxidant capacity, and metal contents of the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">VCO</styled-content> extracted through four different processing methods: chilling and centrifugation; fermentation; direct micro expelling‐oven dried; and direct micro expelling‐sun‐dried processes. We found that the physicochemical properties, including moisture content, refractive index, viscosity, iodine value, saponification value, peroxide value, free fatty acid, and fatty acid content, of all the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">VCO</styled-content> conform to the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">APCC</styled-content>) standard. All of the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">VCO</styled-content> predominantly contains lauric acid which is in the range of 48.40%–52.84% of the fatty acid content. The total phenolic content and

  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">IC</styled-content>
  <sub class="sub">50</sub>) of the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">VCO</styled-content> was obtained to be in the range of 1.16–12.54 mg gallic acid equivalents (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">GAE</styled-content>)/g and 7.49–104.52 mg/ml, respectively, and the metal contents in the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">VCO</styled-content> were within the acceptable range of the recommended 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">APCC</styled-content> limit. These findings ensure good quality and safety assurance of the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">VCO</styled-content> produced from the coconut grown in Brunei Darussalam through the different processing methods.
