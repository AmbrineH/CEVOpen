<p class="p">The saponification value (SV) of the VCO was determined using the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) method (Rigaudy &amp; Klesney, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). About 2.0 g of VCO sample was mixed with 25 ml of 0.5 N ethanolic KOH, and the mixture was boiled for 60 min in a reflux condenser. The mixture was then cooled down to room temperature and subsequently titrated with 0.5 N HCl using 1% phenolphthalein solution as an indicator until the color of the mixture changed from pink to colorless. The volume of spent HCl was recorded and represented as
