<p class="p">Antioxidant capacity of the phenolic compounds extracted from the VCO (described in Section 2.4.9) was measured based on its DPPH radical‐scavenging activity according to the reported method (Hatano, Kagawa, Yasuhara, Tasuhara, &amp; Okuda, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). In this study, the extracted phenolic compounds (1,000 μl) with concentrations ranging from 0 to 5,000 ppm were added into 1,000 μl methanolic solution of DPPH (50 ppm). The reaction mixture was then vortexed at 40 Hz for 5 min and kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 520 nm using single‐beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV–1800, Japan). Radical scavenging activity (RSA) related to the inhibitory effect of DPPH radical was calculated according to
