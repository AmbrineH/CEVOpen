<p class="p">The refractive index (RI) of the VCO samples were measured using a precision Abbé refractometer (Bellingham &amp; Stanley, U.K.) having a measuring range of refractive index of 1.300–1.700 with the accuracy within ±0.0002. A thin layer of VCO was sandwiched between illuminating and refracting prisms. The sample was then illuminated with monochromatic light from sodium vapor lamp, and the RI was recorded.</p>
