<p class="p">The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was extracted according to the AOAC method (Horwitz, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Approximately 50 mg of VCO was dissolved in 4 ml of 0.5 mol/L methanolic HCl. The solution was mixed thoroughly, followed by incubation at 50°C for 4 hr and cooling to room temperature. FAME was purified using 10 ml of hexane, and the clear upper layer containing FAME was then passed through anhydrous Na

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> for drying. The extracted FAME was identified using gas chromatography following the protocols outlined by Moigradean, Poiama, Alda, and Gogoasa (
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The composition of FAME was evaluated using a gas chromatography‐mass spectrometer (GC‐MS) QP 2010 (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a split/split less injector. The separation of the compounds was performed on a DB‐5 ms column (length 30 m, diameter 0.25 mm, and thickness 0.25‐μm film). Helium was used at flow rate of 1.00 ml/min and a split ratio of 100.0. The injector temperature was 250°C. The oven temperature was held at 60°C for 10 min, and it was increased to 140°C at a rate of 10°C/min and the final temperature was held for 10 min. The temperature was then further increased to 250°C at a rate of 7°C/min and held at this final temperature for 10 min. Mass‐selective detector conditions were set at capillary direct interface temperature of 230°C, ionization energy of 70 eV; and full‐scan mode with a mass range of 40–850 amu. The FAME in the VCO were identified by matching the retention indexes and mass spectra of the unknown compounds with those of standard compounds. The weight fractions of the FAMEs were measured based on the percentage represented by the area of corresponding peak relative to the sum of the area of all peaks.
