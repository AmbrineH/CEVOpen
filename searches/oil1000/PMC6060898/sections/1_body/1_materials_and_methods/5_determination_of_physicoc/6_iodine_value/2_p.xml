<p class="p">Iodine value (IV) of the VCO was determined using Wijs method (AOCS, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Approximately 3.0 g of VCO was mixed with 20 ml cyclohexane to dissolve the fat content; 25 ml of Wijs solution was then added. The flask was sealed and the solution was continuously shaken for 30 min. Also, 20 ml aqueous KI solution (15% v/v) and 100 ml of water were then added to the mixture. The mixture was titrated with 0.1 N Na
