<p class="p">Acid digestion was used to determine the amount of metals, including lead, copper and iron (Pb, Cu, and Fe), contained in the VCO according the method reported by Ang and Lee (
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). About 0.5 g of VCO was added into 9 ml of freshly‐prepared mixture of HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (63%) and HCl (37%) at 1:3 ratio in a digestion flask. The mixture was boiled gently over a water bath at a temperature of 80–90°C for 4–5 hr until the sample had completely dissolved. Once digestion has completed, the mixture was then cooled down to room temperature and filtered through filter paper (Whatman No. 42; 2.5‐μm particle retention). The extract was then evaporated to remove excessive acid, and the volume was topped up to 50 ml with distilled water. The metals in the VCO were quantitatively measured using Nov AA 300 (Analytik Jena, Germany) atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS). The measurement condition was optimized for the determination of the metals with the limit of detection of 1 μg/l. The standard calibration of the metals was measured from 0 to 10 ppm.
