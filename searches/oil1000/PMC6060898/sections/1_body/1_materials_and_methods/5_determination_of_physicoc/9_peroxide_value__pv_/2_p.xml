<p class="p">The PV of the VCO was determined according to the standard IUPAC method (Rigaudy &amp; Klesney, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). 5.0 g of VCO was added into a 25 ml acetic acid‐chloroform (3:2) solution, followed by adding 1 ml of saturated KI solution, and the solution was stirred until the oil has been completely dissolved. The solution was then incubated in the dark for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by addition of 75 ml of distilled water. Finally, the solution was titrated with 0.01 N Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> with a starch solution as an indicator until the color changes to colorless. The volume of titration was recorded and the PV was calculated using
