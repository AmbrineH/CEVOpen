<p class="p">The total phenolic content (TPC) of the VCO was estimated using Folin–Ciocalteau reagent (Gutfinger, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>). Polyphenol compounds were extracted from the VCO by dissolving 10.0 g VCO in 50 ml hexane and three successive extractions with 20 ml of 80% methanol. The extract was dried using a rotary evaporator, and the final residue was mixed with 5 ml of 80% methanol. An aliquot (0.3 ml) of the mixture was treated with 1.5 ml of 10‐fold diluted Folin‐Ciocalteau reagent. A volume of 1.3 ml of 7.5% Na

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was then added into the solution, and it was allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of phenolic content in the solution was recorded using spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) at 760 nm. The total phenolic content was expressed as GAE per gram of VCO (Nevin &amp; Rajamohan,
