<p class="p">Freshly harvested, mature coconuts aged more than 12 months were obtained from local markets in Tutong and Brunei‐Muara district in Brunei Darussalam. The variety of the coconut was Malayan tall dwarf (MTD). Only coconuts which had not sprouted were selected, and their milk was taken out from the coconut fruits. The coconut milk was purified by a local company, IMBRU Essential Oils. It then was further processed into VCO using C&amp;C, FER, and DME methods as described below.</p>
