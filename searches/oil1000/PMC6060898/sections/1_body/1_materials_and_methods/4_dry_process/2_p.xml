<p class="p">The VCO was extracted using dry process according to the DME method given by Asian Pacific Coconut Community (APCC, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) with some minor modifications. In this dry process, the kernel of the coconut was heated under controlled conditions, depending on the oven‐dry or sun‐dry process, to remove its moisture content, while preventing any microbial invasion from occurring. Subsequently, the dried kernel was pressed mechanically to obtain its oil. In this current study, we have applied two DME approaches, namely oven‐dried (DME‐OD) and sun‐dried (DME‐SD), to remove the moisture content in the grated coconut meat before the oil is being extracted. For the DME‐OD method, the grated coconut meat was dried in an oven operating at a temperature of 40°C for 4 hr. For the DME‐SD method, the grated coconut meat was dried under sunshine for about 3–4 hr. Then, the dried grated coconut meat was pressed with a modified mechanical jack to produce the VCO. The separated and purified VCO were refrigerated until further use.
