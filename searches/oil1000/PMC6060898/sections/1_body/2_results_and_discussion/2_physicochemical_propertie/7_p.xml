<p class="p">The PV of the VCO is within 2.2–4.2 m‐eq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg, as displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The PV of VCO extracted using C&amp;C and FER (the wet process) methods is within the APCC recommendation (≤3.0 m‐eq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg), whereas that extracted using both DME (the dry process) is slightly higher than the recommended value. Considering that the PV can be used as an indicator of the oxidation or rancidity level of VCO, the low PV of the VCO obtained by the wet process in this study indicates that they are fresh or at early state of oxidation. On the other hand, the high PV of VCO extracted by the dry process is due to oxidation of the substances in the grated coconut meat before the oil is being extracted.
