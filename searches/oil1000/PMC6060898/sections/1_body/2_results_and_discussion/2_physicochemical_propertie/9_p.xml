<p class="p">The FFA obtained from VCO this study is in the range of 0.17%–0.53%. The lowest FFA of VCO extracted by C&amp;C, followed by that from DME‐OD and DME‐SD methods. The FFA of these methods are still within the range of the APCC standard (≤0.5%), but VCO extracted by FER has a slightly higher FFA than that of the standard value. The difference in FFA content among the VCO is due to the variation in their processing conditions. We may note the FFA can be used as an indicator of taste and aroma of VCO; thus, the low FFA of VCO in this study suggests that all of their quality is acceptable by the APCC standard. For comparison, VCO produced by integrated wet process has an FFA of 0.13% (Ahmad, Hasham, Aman Nor, &amp; Sarmidi,
