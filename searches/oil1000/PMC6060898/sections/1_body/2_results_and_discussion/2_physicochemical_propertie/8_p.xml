<p class="p">The values for viscosity of the VCO were found to be in the range of 48.4–52.5 cP. FER method gave the highest viscosity (52.5 ± 1.1 cP) followed closely by DME‐OD, C&amp;C, and DME‐SD methods. It is indicated that the viscosity of the VCO is governed by the FFA and FAME composition. It is due to the fact that the viscosity and the laminar flow of VCO vary with the changes in its FFA and FAME composition.</p>
