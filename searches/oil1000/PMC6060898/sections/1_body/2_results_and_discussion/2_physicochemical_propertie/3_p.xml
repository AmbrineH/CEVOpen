<p class="p">The MC of the VCO in this study was found to be in the range of 0.10%–0.17% (
 <italic class="italic">w/w</italic>), which is within the value recommended by APCC (≤0.3%w/w). This indicates that all of the VCO extracted using C&amp;C, FER, DME‐OD, and DME‐SD methods have low MC, fulfilling the APCC limit. It is noted that the values are slightly higher than that of VCO extracted using fresh‐dry method (0.04%–0.11%) (Mansor, Che Man, Suhaimi, Abdul Afiq, &amp; Ku Nurul,

Notably, the lowest and highest MC is found in VCO extracted by DME‐OD and DME‐SD, respectively. The high MC shown in DME‐SD may be due to the limitation of using sunshine to dry the VCO for a short time (3–4 hr). Drying under sunshine shorter than this period would leave some more water component in the VCO. We expect that the higher moisture content in the oil may give higher percentage of FFA (Che Man, Abdul Karim, &amp; Teng,
