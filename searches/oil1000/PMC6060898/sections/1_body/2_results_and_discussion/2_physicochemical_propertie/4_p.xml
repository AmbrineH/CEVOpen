<p class="p">The RI values of the VCO studied were found to be very narrow from minimum 1.4543 to maximum 1.4544 with a standard deviation of 0.0002. These values were slightly higher (by about 0.006) than the APCC standard range. This deviation is most probably due to the high FFA and FAME contents rather than the purity of the VCO samples. Therefore, we could consider that the certain compositions of FFA and FAME could result in the slightly higher RI of VCO compared with the APCC standard.</p>
