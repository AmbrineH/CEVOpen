<p class="p">The SV of all the VCO showed high values ranging from 259 to 271 mg KOH/g of fats, while the standard value for SV is 248–265 mg KOH/g fats (Codex, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). The highest SV was found in VCO through the dry process, that is, both DME methods, followed by FER and the lowest was found by C&amp;C method. The SV is related to the mean molecular mass of the fats and oils, and it is inversely related to the chain length of the fatty acids fats and oils. This means that the higher the SV, the shorter average chain length of fatty acids. Therefore, VCO extracted by both DME methods tends to possess higher content of the shorter average chain length of fatty acids, in contrast to the VCO from C&amp;C and FER methods. Nevertheless, in general, all the VCO in this study is highly acceptable according to the high MCFA contents.
