<p class="p">The IV of the VCO was found to be between 0.61 and 0.91, much lower than the recommended value by APCC (4.1–11). The lowest IV was measured in VCO extracted using DME‐OD method and the highest IV was detected in VCO produced using C&amp;C method. Since IV indicates the weight percentage of VCO related to unsaturated fatty acids that can absorb halogens such as iodine (Fakhri &amp; Qadir,
