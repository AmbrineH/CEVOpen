<p class="p">The different extraction methods of VCO, including C&amp;C, FER, DME‐OD, and DME‐SD, resulted in large differences in the yield. The highest yield was given by DME‐OD (47.92%), followed by DME‐SD (40.60%), C&amp;C (20.44%), and FER (9.43%). In Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, we show the physicochemical properties, namely the MC, RI, IV, SV, PV, viscosity, and FFA of the VCO extracted by the four different methods. The standard values related to the physicochemical properties and antioxidant capacities of VCO provided by APCC (APCC (Asian Pacific Coconut Community),
