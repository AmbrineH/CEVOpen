<p class="p">The FAME compositions of the VCO extracted by the four different methods are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. This fatty acid analysis is essential to provide the information regarding fatty acid distribution in the VCO (Kamariah et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In this study, it was found that the fatty acid predominantly contains lauric acid (C12) ranging from 48.40% to 52.84%, which is in agreement with the APCC standard for VCO (45.10%–53.20%) (APCC (Asian Pacific Coconut Community), 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The highest lauric acid composition was found in VCO extracted using DME‐OD. This VCO has higher lauric acid composition compared with that of C&amp;C, FER, or even with the integrated wet process (Ahmad et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Hamid, Sarmidi, Mokhtar, Sulaiman, &amp; Azila, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Though the variation of the fatty acid compositions can occur during extraction, our findings demonstrate that DME‐OD is an efficient method to produce high lauric acid composition. It is noteworthy that the total MCFA (C6–C12) is 70.1%, 69.6%, 71.3%, and 65.7% for VCO extracted using C&amp;C, FER, DME‐OD, and DME‐SD, respectively. These values are much higher than that found in VCO produced by the integrated wet process 62.6%–63.7%) (Hamid et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Overall, the fatty acid analysis suggests that the VCO in this study has a high total MCFA. Consequently, their long‐chain fatty acid (C14–C18) content which is 24.7%, 24.0%, 22.3%, and 19.8%, respectively, is much lower than those in VCO produced by the integrated wet process (29.05%). Another important fatty acid composition is the unsaturated fatty acid in the VCO. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, the unsaturated linoleic acid C18:1 is in the range of 2.1% to 2.9%, whereas the amount of linoleic acid C18:2 was undetected in the VCO samples. However, the undefined fatty acid which is roughly more than 5.3% may contain some longer chains of unsaturated fatty acid.
