<p class="p">The metals contents in the VCO in this study were analyzed using AAS with acid digestion method as described in section 2.4.11. As listed in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, it is found that Cu is in the range of 0.01 to 0.07 ppm, Fe 0.13 to 0.44 ppm, and Pb in the range of 0.03 to 0.07 ppm, respectively. It is interesting to note that Cu and Fe are well known as prooxidants due to their ability to catalyze the disintegration (decomposition) of hydroperoxides in oil into free radicals, whereas Pb, the heavy metal, is known for its toxicity and carcinogenicity (Ali, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Chi, Zuo, &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Thus, for healthy and safety assurance, the presence of Cu, Fe, and Pb in the VCO should not exceed a certain value. According to APCC standard, the maximum permitted concentration for Cu, Fe, and Pb in VCO should be less than 0.4, 5, and 0.1 ppm, respectively. Based on the data presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, those metal contents in VCO of this study do not exceed the recommended APCC limit, ensuring the quality and safety assurance of the VCO for consumption as well as for utilization externally. However, in comparison, Pb level in the VCO is a few times higher than that in vegetable oils (in the range of 0.0060.018 μg/g) (Zhu, Fan, Wang, Qu, &amp; Yao, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), but it is much lower than that in sesame oils (0.1250.200 μg/g) (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>).
