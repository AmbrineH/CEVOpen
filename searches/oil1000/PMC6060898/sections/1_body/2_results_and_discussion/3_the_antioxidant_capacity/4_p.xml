 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values, which represent the concentration of the VCO needed to reduce 50% of the initial DPPH radicals, is in the range of 7.49 to 104.52 mg/ml. This so‐called radical scavenging activity (RSA) of the VCO is much higher (indicating their lower antioxidant capacity) than other reported VCO of Malayan tall dwarf variety extracted using wet processes (1.24 mg/ml in VCO extracted using FER and 1.66 mg/ml in VCO extracted using chilling and thawing technique, Marina, Che Man, &amp; Amin, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Although all of the VCO should contain hydrogen‐donating capability, this result implies that a significant difference in the antioxidant activity of the VCO depends on the processing condition. In this regard, the VCO obtained using FER shows the strongest antioxidant capacity, followed by C&amp;C and DME methods. Notably, the highest TPC was found to be the VCO extracted using FER method. Therefore, this finding highlights the correlation between TPC and the scavenging activity, and hence the antioxidant capacity. This is in accordance with that reported by Marina, Che Man, and Amin (
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) where the VCO with FER method has the strongest scavenging effect on DPPH and the highest antioxidant activity. Interestingly, VCO obtained through C&amp;C method shows higher antioxidant capacity although its TPC is the lowest. It can be rationalized that cold extraction condition employed in the C&amp;C method may preserve the thermally unstable antioxidant compounds in the VCO.
