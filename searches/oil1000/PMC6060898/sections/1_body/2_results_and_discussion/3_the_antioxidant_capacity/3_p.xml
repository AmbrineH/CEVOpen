<p class="p">We recall that the phenolic compounds in VCO have been determined by Marina, Che Man, Nazimah, and Amin (
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). They are mainly protocatechuic, vanillic, caffeic, syringic, ferulic, and p‐coumaric derivatives, which strongly contribute to the antioxidant capacity of the VCO. The TPC in VCO has been demonstrated to be higher compared with that in the refined coconut oil (Dia, Garcia, Mabesa, &amp; Tecson‐Mendoza,

 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The beneficial effects of the phenolic antioxidants and their high content in VCO make it to be one of the edible oils rich in phenolic compounds. Moreover, VCO with higher TPC is expected to have a higher antioxidant capacity.
