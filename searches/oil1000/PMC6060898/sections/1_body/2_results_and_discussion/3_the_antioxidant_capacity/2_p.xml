<p class="p">We summarize polyphenol content and the antioxidant capacity of the VCO as given by TPC and IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The TPC in the VCO was found to be in the range of 1.16 to 12.54 mg GAE/g oil. The highest TPC (12.54 ± 0.96 mg GAE/g oil) was found in the VCO extracted using FER, followed by DME‐SD, DME‐OD, and C&amp;C methods. It is well known that TPC in oil was strongly affected by the processing methods (Marina, Che Man, &amp; Amin, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Notably, the TPC in the VCO extracted using FER and DME‐SD is much higher compared with that obtained by DME‐OD and C&amp;C methods. This finding may not be so surprising, as it has been suggested that the dry process may destroy some of the phenolic compound in the VCO (Seneviratne &amp; Dissanayake, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In other words, the TPC in VCO by wet process tends to be higher than that of the dry process. Interestingly, the VCO extracted using FER method shows a very high TPC, four times higher than that of the values obtained in the studies reported by Ahmad et al. (

 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), which is about 16.02 and 4.34 mg GAE/g oil, respectively, using the same method of integrated wet process. Our findings revealed that the FER method, a wet process, gave the highest TPC in the VCO.
