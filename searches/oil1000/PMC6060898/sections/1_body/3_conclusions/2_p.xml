<p class="p">In this study, we have investigated the physicochemical properties (moisture content, refractive index, viscosity, iodine value, saponification value, peroxide value, and free fatty acid) of VCO produced in Brunei Darussalam, which were obtained through four different methods, including the wet and dry processes. With the different processing methods, the extraction yield is in the range of 9.4%–47.9%, with the highest oil recovery being obtained from the dry processes (DME methods). We found that most of their physicochemical properties are within the acceptable range or comparable with the recommended values given by APCC (Asian Pacific Coconut Community), 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>. All of the VCO predominantly contains lauric acid as high as 48.40%–52.84% of the fatty acid content with the total MCFA being in the range of 65.7%–71.3%. The phenolic compounds in the VCO were found in a certain amount depending on the processing method, and their DPPH radical‐scavenging activity was obtained to be 7.49–104.52 mg/ml. The metal contents in the VCO are also within the acceptable range of the recommended APCC limit, ensuring the quality and safety assurance of the VCO for consumption as well as for utilization externally. These findings ensure good quality and safety assurance of the VCO produced from the coconut grown in Brunei Darussalam through the different processing methods. Overall, in terms of cost to extract, yield, and quality of VCO, we conclude that the DME‐OD is the most suitable method for mass production of VCO.
