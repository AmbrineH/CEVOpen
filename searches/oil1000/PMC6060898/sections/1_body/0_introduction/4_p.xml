<p class="p">This work focuses on the physicochemical properties of VCO extracted by different methods to meet the quality of VCO according to the APCC standard (APCC (Asian Pacific Coconut Community), 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The extraction of VCO was carried out using both wet and dry processes, including chilling and centrifugation (C&amp;C), fermentation (FER), and direct micro expelling (DME) methods. All these processes are known to be efficient and quick to produce VCO with the high heat stability. To evaluate the antioxidant potential of the VCO, its total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant capacity were determined using chemical assays. The metal contents in the VCO were also investigated. This study reports the physicochemical and quality characteristics of the VCO, including moisture content, fatty acid content, free fatty acid content, iodine value, peroxide value, saponification value, refractive index, and viscosity, as well as total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, antioxidant capacity, and metal contents in the VCO produced in Brunei Darussalam.
