<p class="p">Virgin coconut oil is produced by several methods which can be generally categorized into wet and dry methods (Bawalan &amp; Chapman, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). In the wet method, VCO is directly extracted from the coconut meat/kernel by either chilling and centrifugation, fermentation, enzymatic, pH method, or any of these combinations to destabilize the coconut milk emulsion without the drying process (Raghavendra &amp; Raghavarao, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In contrast, for the dry method, the kernel is dried by controlled heating to remove the moisture, preventing microbial invasion from occurring. VCO is obtained by pressing the dried kernel mechanically. The yield of VCO strongly depends not only on the extraction methods but also on several factors, including time of harvesting, age of coconut, location of plantation, and the age of copra before the extraction (Carandang, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). An important deciding factor in the assessment of the quality of VCO is its physicochemical properties, such as moisture content, fatty acid content, free fatty acid content, iodine value, peroxide value, saponification value, and viscosity. In addition, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacity and the metal composition in VCO are known to affect its rate of oxidation, nutritional value, preservation properties, and shelf life (Murillo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Several reviews on the quality of VCO have been reported (Amri, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Belitz &amp; Grosch, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Gopala Krishna et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Marina, Che Man, &amp; Amin, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and its physicochemical properties have been standardized by the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community (APCC, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, not all of the quality and nutritional characteristics of VCO in the Asian and Pacific area are reported. In particular, VCO extracted in the coconut industries in Brunei Darussalam has never been reported. It is therefore necessary to determine the quality of VCO produced in the area.
