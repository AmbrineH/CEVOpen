<p class="p">Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is an edible oil obtained from the milk of fresh and matured kernel of the coconut (
 <italic class="italic">Cocos nucifera</italic> L.) (Marina, Che Man, &amp; Amin, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), a tropical plant belonging to the 
 <italic class="italic">Arecaceae</italic> (palm) family. VCO is colorless with the aroma of fresh coconut, and it has been largely consumed for many purposes in cooking, bakery, confectionary, infant foods, and cosmetics. In cosmetics, VCO is utilized as a substance to enhance beauty, to promote the growth of hairs, and to improve and moisturize skin. Another emerging application of VCO is in the health supplement area, due to the health benefits of medium‐chain fatty acids (MCFA) contained in VCO. MCFA such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, capric, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids are easily digestible (DebMandal &amp; Mandal, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The lauric acid component in VCO, in particular, was reported to show potential for anti‐obesity treatments (Assunção, Ferreira, Dos Santos, Cabral, &amp; Florêncio, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Nevin &amp; Rajamohan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; St‐Onge &amp; Jones, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Moreover, MCFA have some specific functional and nutritional properties, including antiviral, antibacterial, antiplaque, antiprotozoal, healing, anti‐inflammatory, and anti‐obesity effects (German &amp; Dillard, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Gopala Krishna, Raj, Bhatnagar, Prasanth, &amp; Chandrashekar, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Therefore, owing to the essential MCFA content, VCO exhibits some advantages to heal several minor illnesses such as diarrhea, skin inflammations, gastrointestinal problems, minor cuts, injuries, and swelling (Nevin &amp; Rajamohan, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). These properties promote further uses of VCO; for instance, VCO has been recognized as a multipurpose nutrient supplement due to the nutritional and medicinal benefits of its MCFA, vitamins, amino acids, antioxidants, antimicrobial, and antiviral compounds (Kabara, 
 <xref rid="fsn3671-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>; Nevin &amp; Rajamohan,
