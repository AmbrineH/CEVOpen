<p class="p">The present investigation has revealed that conophor nut has the potential for the preparation of plant protein isolates with protein content of over 80%. The isolates have good water and oil absorption, and foaming capacities that were higher than those of other oil seeds. Boiling and toasting only improved the foam stability of the defatted flour but not the protein isolates. The tyrosine and tryptophan contents of the protein isolates were increased as a result of heat processing. Protein isolates from raw, boiled and toasted conophor nut contain substantial amount of essential amino acids required in food for healthy nutrition. The isolates also exhibited higher level of biological value and protein efficiency ratios. Thus, the improved nutritional and functional properties of the conophor nut protein isolates by heat processing may enhance its suitability as novel functional ingredients for the food system at local level and for industrial applications.</p>
