<p class="p">The water absorption capacity (WAC) and oil absorption capacity (OAC) were determined as described by Omowaye‐Taiwo et al. (

Briefly, sample (1.0 g) was weighed into a 15 ml pre‐weighed centrifuge tube to which 10 ml of distilled water (for WAC) or 10 ml of soybean oil (for OAC) was added stepwise with continuous stirring at room temperature for 10 min. The suspension in the tube was centrifuged at 2,500 × 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 20 min and the volume of supernatant measured. The WAC or OAC was calculated as the difference between the initial volume of water or oil used and the final volume of the decanted supernatant and calculated in percentages, taking into consideration the density of the oil.
