<p class="p">The various samples of conophor nuts were defatted as described by Omowaye‐Taiwo, Fagbemi, Ogunbusola, and Badejo (
 <xref rid="fsn3508-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and the resultant flour stored at 4°C for further analyses. Protein isolates were prepared from the defatted flour samples using isoelectric point method as described by Gbadamosi, Abiose, and Aluko (

The two supernatants were mixed together and adjusted to pH 4.5 and kept for 2 hr at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 4,000 x
