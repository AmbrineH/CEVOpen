 <p class="p">This study aims at investigating 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane, a novel bio-based solvent resulting from the hydrogenation of 
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene, as a green alternative to 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane or toluene for the extraction and solubilization of natural substances. First, conductor-like combination of quantum chemistry (COSMO) coupled with statistical thermodynamics (RS) calculations show a comparable solubilization profile of 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane and 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane for carotene, volatile monoterpenes such as carvone and limonene, and model triglycerides. Other data obtained experimentally in solid/liquid extraction conditions further indicate that 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane showed similar performances to 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane for extracting carotenes from carrots, aromas from caraway seeds, and oils from rapeseeds, as these products showed a comparable composition. 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-Menthane was also tested using common analytical extraction procedures such as Soxhlet for determination of oil content via multiple extraction stages, and Dean–Stark for determination of water content via azeotropic distillation. For both systems, yields were comparable, but for Dean–Stark, the distillation curve slope was higher when using 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane, and the time needed to attain 100% water recovery was 55% shorter than for toluene. Taken together, these results reveal the potential of 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane as a green replacer for petroleum-based solvents such as 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane or toluene.
