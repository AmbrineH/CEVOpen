<p class="p">In this work, the potential of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane as a green alternative to petroleum solvents such as 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane and toluene was investigated. This bio-based solvent was prepared by hydrogenation of D- limonene, a by-product of deterpenation of essential oils obtained from orange peels. The solubility of certain bioactive compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane was experimentally and theoretically compared with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane using a simulation software COSMO-RS. It was found that both solvents have relatively similar solvation efficacy. Experimentally, it was observed that a slightly higher extraction yield can be obtained on carrots using the alternative solvent, while for caraway aromas and rapeseed oils, similar extraction potential was recorded for both solvents. 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-Menthane was also used for water determination using Deanâ€“Stark apparatus. As the boiling point of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane is higher than that of toluene, the azeotropic distillation is consequently higher for 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane, leading to a brief delay of the start of the distillation; but once the distillation started, the recovery was 55% shorter than for the toluene. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane could offer an interesting green and sustainable alternative solution to replace some hazardous petroleum-based solvents for a diverse set of applications ranging from practical work for students in academia, to analytical laboratories and industrial processes in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, aroma, and food areas.
