<p class="p">Rapeseed oil is an internationally consumed commodity oil, ranked third worldwide and first in Europe [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Generally, the industrial processing of rapeseed involves pressing followed by extraction with hexane. In fact, pressing as a single unit operation is relatively inefficient and does not ensure complete expulsion of oil. Therefore, solvent extraction is an additional operation for an efficient extraction [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The outcome is two products: oil and low-valued meal. This latter is either used for animal feed or fertilizer. However, this method presents numerous industrial disadvantages as using hexane for rapeseed oil extraction raises many safety and environmental concerns as hexane is listed as a hazardous air pollutant [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and is known as a potential neurotoxic. Considering those concerns, oil extraction of rapeseeds was carried out by solid–liquid extraction using ULTRA-TURRAX
