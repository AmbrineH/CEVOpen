<p class="p">Initially, Dean–Stark apparatus was developed to measure the water content present in petroleum products, which is feasible thanks to the azeotropic ability of numerous compounds [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Nowadays, Dean–Stark apparatus has become a tool associated with the separation of water from different matrices. The latter has repeatedly been modified to cover a broader range of applications. It is widely used for water determination in food products and is frequently cited for products with volatile compounds. The azeotropic distillation occurs between water and petroleum solvents such as toluene [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. While toluene gives satisfying results, it is labeled as hazardous and toxic [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. To mitigate environmental and health concerns related to this solvent, new alternative were considered [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In this way, a range of terpenes were investigated including 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and the results showed that there are no significant differences between toluene and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene procedures, thus concluding that 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene could be considered as a possible alternative for petroleum-based solvents.
