 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02170-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows water distillation kinetics of carrots for both toluene and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane. The azeotropic distillation of the mixture has different kinetics for water recovery for each solvent because of the boiling point difference. Water distillation kinetics were somewhat similar for the two solvents. When using 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane, the water recovery was delayed by 2 min. However, once the distillation started, the alternative solvent gave a faster water recovery compared with toluene. The boiling point of the azeotropic mix is very close to the water boiling point; the water is accordingly more volatile as to lower temperatures. The distillation curve slope was higher when using 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane, whereas the time needed to attain 100% water recovery was 55% shorter than for toluene. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane will reduce not only the procedure duration, but also the energy consumption. The percentage of carrot water content obtained through this process was 81.5% and 82.4% for toluene and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane, respectively, which means that 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane could possibly replace toluene in a Deanâ€“Stark procedure.
