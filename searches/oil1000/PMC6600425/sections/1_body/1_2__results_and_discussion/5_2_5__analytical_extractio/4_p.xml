<p class="p">These results point out that for both solvents, the fatty acid profile of the resulting oils (the composition) and the mass yields of the extraction process are very similar. The main fatty acids extracted using both solvents are oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) acids. These three unsaturated fatty acids represent more than 85% of the total extracted oil fatty acid composition. Even though 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane is widely used for vegetable oil extraction using Soxhletin analytical laboratories because of its high extraction and selectivity abilities, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane exhibited similar capacities, making it a competitive and efficient alternative.
