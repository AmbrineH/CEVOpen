<p class="p">The extraction results on rapeseeds are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02170-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The mass yield of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane extraction was compared with that of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (40.5% vs. 39.5%, respectively). No significant difference was noted, which may be the result of the strong polar nature of both solvents that leads to a high dissolving power for triglycerides. Additionally, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane has a higher boiling point, inducing a decrease of oil viscosity and giving a better diffusion rate in the rapeseed matrix.
