<p class="p">The chemical selectivity and performance comparison between the two solvents for two major compounds that are 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene and S-carvone were determined using GC-MS (gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry). Several authors established that those two monoterpenes are the major compounds of caraway seeds in extractions carried out with different solvents [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02170-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, it is interesting to notice that both solvents showed a relatively similar profile of aroma compounds with no particular solvent selectivity detected. The major compounds extracted from caraway seeds were S-carvone with approximately 60% for 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane and 64% for 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, followed by 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene with 40% and 35% for 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, respectively.
