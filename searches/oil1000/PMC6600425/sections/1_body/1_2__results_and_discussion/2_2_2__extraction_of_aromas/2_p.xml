<p class="p">A study conducted by Filly et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] compared the performance of eight alternative solvents (α-pinene, MeTHF, ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethanol, dimethylcarbonate, and water) to n-hexane for extraction of aromas from caraway seeds. The results showed that bio and green solvents have the potential to replace petroleum-based solvents. Here, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-Menthane was evaluated as an alternative to
