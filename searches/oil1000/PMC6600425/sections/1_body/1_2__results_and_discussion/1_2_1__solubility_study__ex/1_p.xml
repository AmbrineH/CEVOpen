<p class="p">A theoretical study was performed considering the technical parameters of the solvents for the extraction of the targeted compounds via a computational predictive method (COSMO-RS). Solvent selectivity is a matter of polarity-based solubility parameters that involves both solutes and solvents. The software screening model for solvents is a method used to determine and predict thermodynamic properties of the solvent without the need for any experimental data. This is based on conductor-like combination of quantum chemistry (COSMO) coupled with statistical thermodynamics (RS) [
