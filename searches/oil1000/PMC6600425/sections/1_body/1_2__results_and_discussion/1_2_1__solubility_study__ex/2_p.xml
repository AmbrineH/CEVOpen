 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02170-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the COSMO-RS predicted solubilities of (i) β-carotene, (ii) three model triglycerides (LLL, OLL, and LOP; with L, O, and P for linoleoyl, oleoyl, and palmitoyl chains, respectively), and (iii) 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene and S-carvone aroma compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane. These targeted solutes were chosen as they represent valuable compounds extractable from carrots, rapeseeds, and caraway, respectively. The simulations were carried out by taking into consideration the solvent boiling points (b.p.) and the operating laboratory conditions set at 25 °C. The results expressed in log10 (x-soluble) show a high theoretical solubility of the compounds in both solvents. In most cases, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane has probability of solubility higher than, or similar to, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, which represents a significant first step to determine whether 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane can successfully replace 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane for the extraction of different natural products.
