Carrot is considered as an important dietary source of carotenoids, mainly carotenes, which impart their characteristic orange color to carrots. As carotenes are one of the most hydrophobic compounds in the plant kingdom (logP around 15), they cannot be extracted with aqueous solutions of whatever organic solvent. Existing methods of carotene extraction are thus mostly based on pure organic solvents such as
