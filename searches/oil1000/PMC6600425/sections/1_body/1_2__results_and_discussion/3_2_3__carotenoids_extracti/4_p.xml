 <xref rid="molecules-24-02170-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows that a slightly higher yield was obtained for the extraction of α- and β-carotene using 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane compared with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, although the differences were modest. These results are somewhat in agreement with the COSMO-RS predicted solubilization properties of both solvents for β-carotene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02170-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, for this specific application, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane could be considered as a promising alternative to 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane.
