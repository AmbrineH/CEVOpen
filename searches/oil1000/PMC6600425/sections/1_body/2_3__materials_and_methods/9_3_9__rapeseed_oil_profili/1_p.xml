<p class="p">Rapeseed oil FAMEs were separated, identified, and quantified by GC-FID. Preparation of samples from extracted rapeseeds oils was performed using acid-catalyzed trans-methylation [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Then, 1 mL of methanolic sulfuric acid (5% 
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>) was added to a precise volume of extracted oils and the internal standard. The mixture was then heated at 85 °C for 90 min and latter onset to cool until it reached room temperature. Then, 1.5 mL sodium chloride (0.9%) solution and 1 mL 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane were added. The mixture was shaken strongly for 30 s prior to centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min. An aliquot of the organic layer was moved into a vial for a GC analysis using a 7820A GC system (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a BD-EN14103 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm), as well as an FID and an auto-sampler. The carrier gas was helium at 33 mL/s. The sample injection volume was 2 μL, while the split ratio was set at 1:20 at 250 °C. The oven initial temperature was set at 50 °C for 1 min, and then increased to 20 °C/min until it reached 180 °C, then a rate of 2 °C/ min until 230 °C, and was then held isothermally at 230 °C for 10 min. Data collection was carried out by Agilent EZChrom Elite software. Identification of FAMEs was performed in comparison with purified FAME standards (Sigma Co., St Louis, MO, USA), while the quantification was achieved using internal calibration. The internal standard used was glyceryl triheptadecanoate (Sigma Co., Cleveland, OH, USA).
