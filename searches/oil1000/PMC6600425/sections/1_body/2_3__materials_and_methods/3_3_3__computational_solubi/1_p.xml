<p class="p">The solubility of (i) 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-carotene from carrots, (ii) S-carvone and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene aromas from caraway seeds, and (iii) model triglycerides (glyceryltrilinolein, LLL; glyceryloleoyl–dilinoleoyl, OLL; and glyceryllinoleoyl–oleoyl–palmitoyl, LOP) from rapeseeds was evaluated for both 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane using the theoretical prediction model COSMO-RS (COSMO software). Computation methods consider the technical properties of the solvents to assay and examine the solutes. The chemical structures of the solvents and solutes were transformed by JChemPaint version 3.3 (GitHub Pages, San Francisco, CA, USA), while for the entry syntax, (SMILES) notation was followed. They were then used for the solubility parameters calculation of solvents and targeted compounds. Predictions of relative solubility were carried out at two temperatures: 25 °C and at the boiling point of each solvent (extraction temperature).
