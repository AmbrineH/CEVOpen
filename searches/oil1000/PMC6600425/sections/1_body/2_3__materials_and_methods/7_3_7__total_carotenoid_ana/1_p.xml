<p class="p">Total carotenoids were quantified using UV/visible spectrophotometry (Biochrom Libra S22 UV/Vis spectrometer, Guibeville, France). Absorbances were measured at 450 nm using 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane as a blank. Carotene concentration in each extract was calculated via a calibration curve previously obtained using a pure standard of β-carotene (&gt;98%). The carotene yield was expressed as g (β-carotene) per 100 g of dry matter (%).
