<p class="p">Hydrogenation of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene to 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane at a low temperature (approximately 40–50 °C) was carried out using a ruthenium catalyst on activated charcoal, thus leaving a great margin to control the exothermicity of the reaction (boiling points of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane are 177 and 170 °C, respectively). A catalytic charge of 1.5 wt% ruthenium on charcoal (5 wt%) was sufficient to completely hydrogenate limonene under 25 bars of hydrogen pressure. Those tests were conducted on a maximum batch of 56 g of 
 <italic class="italic">
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>
 </italic>-limonene. All reactions were conducted until complete conversion of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene to 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane was achieved, the purity of which was determined by gas chromatography. The products were all mixed and then filtered under vacuum on Clarcel (filter aid) to retain the catalyst and give a completely colorless liquid product. The overall mass yield of the operation was 97%. Losses could be attributed to transfers and the amount of material retained on the filter during the removal of the catalyst.
