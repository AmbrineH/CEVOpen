<p class="p">The identification and quantification of extracts was carried out using HPLC-DAD consisting of a HPLC Agilent 1200 equipped with a UV/vis detector (DAD). Separation was attained at a temperature of 25 °C on a YMC C30 column (250 × 4.6 mm and 3 µm ID). The mobile phase in this case consisted of a combination of A (methanol/MTBE/water, 81/15/4) and B (methanol/MTBE/water, 10/90/4). The linear gradient was from 100% to 0% B (

To establish carotenoids calibration curves, standard carotenoids were used with concentrations ranging from 5, 10, 25, 50, to 100 mg/L. Identification of the main carotenoids in carrot extracts was carried out in triplicate by comparing the retention times and absorption spectra.
