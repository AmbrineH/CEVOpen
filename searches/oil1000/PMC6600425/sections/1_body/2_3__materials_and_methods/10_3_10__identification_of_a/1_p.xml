<p class="p">Aroma identification was carried out using an Agilent 6890N GC coupled with an Agilent 5973 MS (Agilent, Massy, France). The extracts were analyzed on a fused-silica capillary column HP-1MSTM (polydimethylsiloxane, 50 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness; Interchim, Montluçon, France) and INNOWAX (polyethyleneglycol, 50 m × 0.20 mm i.d. × 0.4 µm film thickness; Interchim, Montluçon, France). The carrier gas was helium pumped at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C with split ratio of 1:150. The initial temperature was set at 45 °C and increased by a rate of 2 °C/min until 250 °C, and was then held isothermal for 20 min at either 250 °C (apolar column) or 230 °C (polar column). The temperature of 230 °C is the ion source temperature (apolar column) and 250 °C corresponds to the transfer line temperature (polar column). The ionization energy was set at 70 eV.</p>
