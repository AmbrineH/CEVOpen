<p class="p">The electrical heating was maximized in the beginning of the experiment until the first droplets in the Dean–Stark receiver were collected. The heating was then adapted to a distillation rate of 100 drops/min. When most of the water was distilled (approximately 80%), heating was then increased to a distillation rate of 200 drops/min and continued until the end of the distillation. About 30 mL of either toluene or 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-menthane was added at the top of the condenser to recover the water droplets that adhered to the condenser. The Dean–Stark collector was then cooled to room temperature for a few minutes until the layer was clear.
