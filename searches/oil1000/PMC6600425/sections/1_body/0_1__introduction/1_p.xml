<p class="p">Extraction is a key tool to supply the ever-increasing market requirement for bioactive compounds, and sustains and contributes to the rapid growth of the agro-food industry [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Existing extraction technologies are linked to several technological, environmental, and scientific barriers that are generally complex and difficult to overcome, for instance, minimizing energy and toxic solvent consumption, all the while reducing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission and guaranteeing safety and control for both the final product and the technical staff involved [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Consequently, green engineering and bio-refinery concepts gained a lot of attention worldwide by promoting environmentally friendly and efficient techniques that have the ability to substitute conventional processes [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Studies generally include the design of alternative extraction techniques using, for example, microwaves [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], ultrasound [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], or supercritical fluids [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], but may also involve the search for alternative solvents to replace petrochemical solvents [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Within this context, it is important to state that solvents are widely used in academia for practical work; in analytical chemistry laboratories; as well as in industries to produce aromas, fats and oils, colors, antioxidants, or fine chemicals. They are regarded as liquid medium used either for chemical product synthesis or for extraction, separation, and purification of bioactive compounds from various plant matrices. Most extraction solvents used in academia or industry, like 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane, present undeniable advantages including a low boiling point leading to a highly efficient and simple removal, as well as an easy industrial implementation. However, these low boiling point-solvents also generate substantial amounts of volatile organic compounds, explaining why they are universally considered as hazardous with associated environmental and health issues [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Furthermore, these solvents are often derived from petroleum, a fossil resource. Acknowledging those concerns, many researchers have shifted their focus towards finding green alternatives to substitute petroleum-based solvents [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Within this context, green analytical chemistry (GAC) emerged to investigate clean practical alternatives to substitute polluting methods in order to lessen the ecological issues resulting from the side effects of conventional analytical methodologies that generate an important amount of chemical waste [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. One of the solutions is to develop bio-based liquid phases produced from agricultural by-products [
