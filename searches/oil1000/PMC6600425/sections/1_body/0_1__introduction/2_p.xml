<p class="p">Terpenes, ones of the major secondary metabolite families in plants, have been subjected to multiple investigations as a bio-replacement of conventional solvents [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The most common solvent derived from terpenes is undoubtedly 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], which is mainly present in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> peel essential oils, with levels exceeding 70%–95% [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. It is responsible for the 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> characteristic scent and could represent a valuable solution to the substitution of petrochemical solvent [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Indeed, the world market demand for 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> fruits exceeds 100 million tons. However, up to 40%–50% of the total mass that is treated is considered as peel waste [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Therefore, valorization of this by-product is of great economic and environmental importance for the industry. Studies that investigated limonene include fats’ and oils’ determination in olive seeds using Soxhlet extraction [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], extraction of oil from rapeseed and microalgae [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], carotenoids from tomato [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], aroma from caraway [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and moisture determination by Dean–Stark distillation [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-02170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The results obtained from those studies confirmed the potential of 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-limonene as a green alternative to replace petroleum solvent in the extraction of secondary and primary metabolites from different plant matrices.
