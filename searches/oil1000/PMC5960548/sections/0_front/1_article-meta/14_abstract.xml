 <p class="p">The
  <italic class="italic"> in vitro</italic> antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from
  <italic class="italic"> Melaleuca alternifolia (M. alternifolia)</italic> was evaluated in this report. The antioxidant potential of the essential oil from
  <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> was evaluated by the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method, thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assay, and the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity method. The essential oil from
  <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia </italic>was able to reduce DPPH with an EC50 (concentration for 50% of maximal effect) of 48.35 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml, inhibit the lipid peroxidation with an IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) of 135.9 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml, and eliminate hydroxyl radicals with an EC50 of 43.71 
  <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml. Antimicrobial screening, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration assays showed that the essential oil from
  <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> inhibited strongly the growth of different types of microorganisms, including
  <italic class="italic"> Escherichia coli</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>,
  <italic class="italic"> Penicillium italicum Wehmer,</italic> and
  <italic class="italic"> Penicillium digitatum Sacc</italic>. Thus, the essential oil of
  <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> possesses antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and could be suitable for use as a natural preservative ingredient in food, agriculture, and pharmaceutical industries.
