 <italic class="italic"> E. coli, S. aureus,</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa</italic> are pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], whereas
 <italic class="italic"> P. italicum Wehmer</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> P. digitatum Sacc.</italic> are fungi [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Because these organisms infect, damage, and destroy material used in manufacturing goods or infect the goods produced; these microorganisms increase economic costs in various industries, including medicinal, cosmetic, agriculture, and food industries. Thus, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil from
 <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> was investigated with three different methods: the antimicrobial screening method and the MIC and MBC assays. The results presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3" class="xref">Table 3</xref> clearly show that the essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia </italic>displayed significant antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms tested. The Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the essential oil than Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic> had the lowest MIC (2â€‰mg/ml). These data are consistent with previous observations that
 <italic class="italic"> Melaleuca alternifolia </italic>essential oil possesses antibacterial and antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. According to Cox et al. (2000), the antimicrobial activity of the
 <italic class="italic"> M. alternifolia</italic> terpenes is associated with their strong hydrophobicity. Here, the hydrophobic terpenes interact strongly with the membrane lipids of the pathogenic microorganisms, which affect the permeability of the membrane [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Among the main consequences of membrane permeability are (i) modification of the proton-motive force, leading to a deficit in the production of cellular energy caused by the decrease in ATP generation, and (ii) cellular lyses due to leakage or coagulation of the cytoplasm [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The compound terpinene-4-ol, also identified amongst the main constituents of the Iranian Cymbopogon Olivieri essential oil, has been implicated in the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and the yeast
