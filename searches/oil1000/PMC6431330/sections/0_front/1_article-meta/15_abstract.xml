 <p id="Par1" class="p">The goal of this study was to determine the effect of 
  <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> L. (oregano) preparations on the storage stability of vacuum-packed low-pressure mechanically separated meat (BAADER meat) from chickens stored at − 18 °C for 9 months. Oregano was added into the meat as a dried spice, extracts in water and ethanol (40 and 70% (
  <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>)), and an essential oil. The control samples did not contain oregano. The samples were examined immediately after arrival into the laboratory and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 months of storage. Oregano essential oil was most effective in slowing down lipid oxidation and inhibiting the growth of bacteria in BAADER meat. The number of coliform bacteria in the BAADER meat samples with the 0.1% essential oil was significantly lower than that in the control samples. The storage time was seen to have a more significant effect on the quality of BAADER meat.
