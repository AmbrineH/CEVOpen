<p id="Par2" class="p">Increased production of chickens for culinary purposes and manufacturing meat products has resulted in a higher yield of poultry skeletons, bones, and trimmings that remain after the largest muscles (breast and thigh) are separated. These parts still contain a significant part of muscle tissue, most of which can be recovered through mechanically separated meat (MSM) production (EFSA, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ruk, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2011</xref>). Production issues, quality requirements, and storage/use guidelines for MSM are regulated by the European Parliament. According to MSM definition in Commission Regulation No. 853/2004 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2004</xref>), mechanically separated poultry meat is a product obtained from poultry carcasses by removing meat from tissues adhering to the bones, using mechanical means, which leads to loss or modification of muscle fiber structure. The quality as well as the processing utility of this raw material largely depend on the technique through which it is obtained. MSM can be separated using high- or low-pressure technology, known in industrial practice as “high-pressure MSM” and “low-pressure MSM.” In the European poultry industry, high-pressure techniques are most often used to obtain MSM from chickens (EFSA, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2013</xref>). The raw material is characterized by a very high degree of disintegration, a high fat proportion, a paste-like consistency, and significant amounts of bone marrow from crushed bones. The low-pressure technique involves the use of devices that separate the remains of muscle tissue from the connective tissue and tendons without damaging the bone structure. A characteristic feature of low-pressure MSM is therefore the preservation of muscle fibre structure and significantly lower content of bone fragments, compared to the product obtained with high-pressure MSM (Botka-Petrak et al.,
