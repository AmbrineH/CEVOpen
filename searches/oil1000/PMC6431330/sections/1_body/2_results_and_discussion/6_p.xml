<p id="Par23" class="p">The antimicrobial activity of oregano is associated with the presence of components such as phenols, alcohols, ketones, ethers, and hydrocarbons (Grochev and Girow,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2011</xref>). According to Grochev and Girow (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2009</xref>), the active compounds thymol and carvacrol have the strongest antimicrobial activity in oregano oil. The actions of these compounds on bacterial cells has been recognized. In relation to Gram-negative bacteria, this mechanism comprises disintegration of the cell membrane by interference with the structure of lipopolysaccharides and increasing the permeability of cytoplasmic membrane to ATP, the leak of which eventually leads to cell death (Helander et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">1998</xref>). In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, carvacrol interacts with the cell membrane, changing its permeability to H
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> and K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> cations. The change in the gradient of these cations disturbs the basic processes in the cell, resulting in its death (Ultee et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2002</xref>).
