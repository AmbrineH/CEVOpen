<p id="Par20" class="p">The results obtained indicate that oregano preparations used in this study differed in terms of the type and quantity of active substances (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In the oregano extract dominated rosemary acid, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and carnosol. The acids were also the main components of the oregano ethanol extracts. It was also found that the 40% ethanol extract (
 <italic class="italic">v/v</italic>) of oregano contained over twice as much carnosol as the 70% extract. In turn, the essential oil obtained from this plant in terms of quantity was dominated by: carvacrol, 1,4-cineole, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene, thymol, and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene.
