<p id="Par27" class="p">Based on the results of several different tests used to assess the lipid oxidation status, it was shown that cooked breast and thigh muscles of chickens previously treated with marinade containing dried oregano, sage, and honey showed higher oxidative stability than unmarinated meat after 96 h storage at 4 °C (Sampaio et al.,

A combination of adding oregano preparation and the appropriate packaging method results in a good effect in terms of prolonging the duration of the suitability of poultry meat for consumption. In case of breast muscles of chickens with the addition of oregano oil packed in MAP packaging, the oxidation and microbiological changes were slowed down, which resulted in prolonging their shelf life by 5–6 days (Chouliara et al.,
