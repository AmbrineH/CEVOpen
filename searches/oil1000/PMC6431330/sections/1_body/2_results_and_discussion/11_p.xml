<p id="Par28" class="p">The antioxidant effect of water oregano extracts was demonstrated in storage stability studies on vacuum-packed raw beef and pork patties that were stored frozen for 4 months (Rojas and Brewer, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, the oxidative and microbiological stability of raw ground pork (Hernández-Hernández et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2009</xref>; Nieto et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2013</xref>; Shan et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2009</xref>) and beef patties (Sánchez-Escalante et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2003</xref>) improved on using alcohol oregano extracts. Assessing the storage stability of pork and beef after the addition of plant extracts, it was also seen that the antioxidant effect of oregano is more effective in heat-treated than in raw meat (Fasseas et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2007</xref>).
