<p id="Par22" class="p">The antioxidant properties of oregano are due to the presence of phenolic acids, including caffeic, neochlorogenic, rosmarinic, and carnosic acid, and carnosol (Hernández-Hernández et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2009</xref>). The antioxidant activity of oregano is also attributed to the presence of carvacrol, thymol, and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, all of which chelate metal ions and react with free radicals (Kozłowska and Ścibisz, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2011</xref>). According to Capecka et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2005</xref>), the antioxidant activity of plant extracts depends not only on the number of polyphenolic compounds, but also on their chemical structure. The large ability to scavenge free radicals is demonstrated, inter alia, by rosmarinic acid contained in oregano, due to hydroxyl groups that are present in the ring in the
