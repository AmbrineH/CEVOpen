<p id="Par35" class="p">In order to prolong the shelf life of chicken meat using oregano preparations, combined preservation methods may be used. In the studies on the influence of water oregano extract and packaging method on the microbiological quality of chicken carcasses stored at 4 °C was found, that the use of vacuum packaging resulted in a reduction of microbiological contamination and elongation of shelf life compared to carcasses that were air-packaged on trays (Khaled et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2007</xref>) used 0.1% oregano oil and MAP packaging and obtained a slowdown in microbiological changes that occurred due to reduction in the TBC,
