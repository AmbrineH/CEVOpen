<p id="Par34" class="p">Depending on the form of the spices used (fresh leaves and fruits, essential oils, water and ethanol extracts, droughts), they exhibit diverse effects on the inhibition of microorganism growth in food. Burt (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2004</xref>) reports, that the best antimicrobial properties are found in essential oils, fat extracts, and ethanol extracts of spices, while plant droughts and water extracts show a lower efficacy. The above thesis was confirmed with regard to oregano preparations, both in this work and in previous studies (Hać-Szymańczuk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2014</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2015</xref>). According to the authors, this is due to the formation of different profiles of chemical compounds in these preparations. In the assessment of antimicrobial activity of oregano preparations, it was shown that Gram-positive bacteria (

 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Tetracoccus</italic> sp., 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic>) were more sensitive to the essential oil (Hać-Szymańczuk et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2014</xref>) and water extract (Hać-Szymańczuk et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2015</xref>) of oregano than Gram-negative ones (
 <italic class="italic">Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Proteus mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> Enteritidis). The most resistant among the bacteria tested for the active components contained in the oregano oil were 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> bacteria (Hać-Szymańczuk et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2014</xref>), and the lowest sensitivity to the activity of water extract from this plant was demonstrated by 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella Enteritidis</italic> (Hać-Szymańczuk et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2015</xref>). The authors concluded that the antimicrobial activity of oregano oil was associated with the presence of compounds identified in it: carvacrol, camphor, linalol, R(+) limonene, 1,4-cineol and 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>-terpinene, and in the case of extract: chlorogenic and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumarin acid as well as mirycetin.
