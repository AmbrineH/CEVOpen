<p id="Par29" class="p">On the basis of the obtained results, a tendency to limit the growth of mesophilic aerobic bacteria (TBC, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) and psychrotrophic bacteria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>) in BAADER meat from chickens with the addition of oregano preparations was observed. Compared to the Control sample, despite the statistically insignificant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) difference, the lowest number of these groups of microorganisms was found in the BAADER meat samples with added essential oil (EOS). With the storage time of BAADER meat in a frozen state, regardless of the type of oregano preparation, the number of TBC increased gradually, so that after 3 months, the statistically highest values (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were obtained. In turn, the number of psychrotrophic microorganisms in BAADER meat was the highest (
