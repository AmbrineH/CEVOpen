 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2007</xref>) was followed. Around 30 g of fresh oregano leaves were crumbled, covered with 400 mL of water, and subjected to distillation in a Deryng apparatus (Simax® KAVALIERGLASS, A.S., Prague, Czech Republic) until essential oils were obtained. The chilled distillate was extracted four times using dichloromethane in a separatory funnel, after which water was removed by adding anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The obtained extract was concentrated in a Büchi rotary evaporator model R-205. The solvent was evaporated at a temperature of 30 °C and pressure 540–560 hPa.
