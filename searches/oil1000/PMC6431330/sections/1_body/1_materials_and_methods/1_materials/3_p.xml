<p id="Par9" class="p">The water and ethanol extract of dried oregano were obtained via continuous extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus (Universal Extraction System B-811, Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). The parameters of the extraction process were established in the preliminary study (results unpublished). To prepare each extract, 40 g of dried oregano was distributed into 8 extraction thimbles (5 g per thimble). Distilled water and ethyl alcohol with 40 and 70% (

The raw material in each thimble was extracted with 150 mL of the appropriate solvent for 15 cycles while maintaining the solvent boiling point. The portions obtained from each extract were combined, resulting in approximately 550 mL of raw extracts. The raw extracts were filtered using 180-μm thick filter paper (Whatman GE, LaboPlus Sp. z o.o., Warsaw, Poland). Subsequently, each extract was concentrated in a rotary evaporator Model R-205 (Büchi Labortechnik AG) until approximately 40 g of the extract was left, corresponding to the weight of dried oregano used to obtain the extract.
