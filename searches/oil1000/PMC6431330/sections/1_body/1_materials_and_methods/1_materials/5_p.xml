<p id="Par11" class="p">The characteristic chemical compounds of the oregano preparations were identified and their quantitative amounts determined. For the qualitative and quantitative composition analysis of the oregano extracts, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied using Agilent 1200 liquid chromatograph (Agilent
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a diode array detector (DAD). The determination of volatile compounds in oregano essential oil was performed with a AutoSystem XL Gas Chromatograph (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The equipment of the chromatographs and the process conditions were described by Hać-Szymańczuk et al. (
