<p id="Par15" class="p">TBARS values were assayed using the extraction method described by Pikul et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1989</xref>). Absorbance was measured at 532 nm in a spectrophotometer (GENESYS™ 30 Visible Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). As a control, a mixture of 5 mL of 4% perchloric acid and 5 mL of a 0.02 M solution of 2-thiobarbituric acid was used. The TBARS values were expressed as milligrams of malondialdehyde (MAD) per kilogram of BAADER meat. The TBARS values were calculated according to the formula:

The foil packaging containing meat was opened using a sterile scalpel. From the packaging, 20 g of the sample was taken using a sterile spoon and transferred to 180 mL of 0.1% sterile peptone water (bioMérieux, Paris, France). Each sample was homogenized in a Stomacher blender (Lab Blender 400 Circulator, Seward Laboratory, London, UK) for 1 min at high speed and at room temperature (18 °C). Further, a series of 10-fold dilutions in sterile peptone water were prepared.
