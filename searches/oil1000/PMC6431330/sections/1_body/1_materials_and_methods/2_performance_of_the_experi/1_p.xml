After the samples were thoroughly mixed with oregano preparations, each sample was divided into six portions (250 g each), which were vacuum-packed in plastic bags (PE/PA, thickness 75 µm) using a vacuum machine (C200, Multivac Sepp Haggenmüller GmbH &amp; Co. K.G., Wolfertschwenden, Germany). These samples were stored at − 18 °C for 9 months.
