<p id="Par16" class="p">The microbial analyses included the determination of the total bacterial count (TBC; 30 °C for 48 h) and the number of psychrotrophic bacteria (6 °C for 10 days) on plate count agar (BTL, Lodz, Poland), 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (37 °C for 24 h) on violet red bile glucose agar (BTL), coliform bacteria (37 °C for 48 h) on Endo agar (Biomed, Krakow, Poland), and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. The presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. in 25 g of product was determined using Müller-Kauffman’s medium with tetrathionate and novobiocin, RVS (medium according to Rappaport-Vassilliads with soya), xylose lysine deoxycholate, and Hektoen (BTL). Colonies typical for 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> spp. and suspicious colonies were confirmed using API 20E biochemical tests (bioMerieux). The number of bacteria was expressed as log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> of colony-forming units per gram of meat (log CFU/g).
