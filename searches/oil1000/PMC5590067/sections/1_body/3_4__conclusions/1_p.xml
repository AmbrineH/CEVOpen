<p class="p">According to the results, the essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. monogynum</italic> has a different qualitative and quantitative composition when compared to the composition previously described, showing sesquiterpenes citronellol and farnesol as major constituents. Lower IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values for the tested tumor cell lines proved that this EO has significant cytotoxic activity. EO from 
 <italic class="italic">Z. monogynum</italic> has also proven to exhibit moderate activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cereviseae</italic> yeasts, but not significant activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> bacterial strains. Analysis of the EO composition suggests that the major compounds might not be responsible for the observed activities as citronellol itself was previously tested against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida tropicalis</italic> and showed to be potent against this bacterium.
