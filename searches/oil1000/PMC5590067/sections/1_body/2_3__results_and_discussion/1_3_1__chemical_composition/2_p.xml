 <italic class="italic">Z. monogynum,</italic> from different regions, the composition of each of them is described: In one of the major compounds was the oils citronellal (57.1%), limonene (13.8%), citronellyl acetate (13.1%), and citronellol (6.2%). In the other, the main compounds were 2-undecanone (70.2%) and citronellal (22.5%). It is believed that this difference in composition might be related to the use of leaves from two chemotypes of
