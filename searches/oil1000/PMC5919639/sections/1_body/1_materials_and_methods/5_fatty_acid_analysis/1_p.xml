<p class="p">Yeast cells were directly transmethylated by 2 mL of methanol containing 2.7% (v/v) H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> at 80Â°C for 2 hours. Then, 3 mL of Hexane was added for recovering fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), and 2 mL of NaCl (2.5%, w/v) was used for phase separation. After centrifuge, the upper hexane phase was transferred to a fresh tube and applied for gas chromatography (GC) analysis.
