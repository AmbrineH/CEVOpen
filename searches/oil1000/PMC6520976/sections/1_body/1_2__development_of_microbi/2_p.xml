<p class="p">Although gut microbiota composition varies considerably between infants certain patterns have been identified. Several factors have been shown to influence microbial colonisation of the gut at this stage, including gestational age, birth mode, sanitation, antibiotic exposure, feeding regime and host genetics [

 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, facultative anaerobes have been identified as the initial colonisers [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Depletion of the available oxygen creates the necessary environment for the establishment of strict anaerobes [

 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Although the diversity of the microbiota is generally low at this stage, dominated largely by members of the Actinobacteria phylum in the case of full-term spontaneously vaginally delivered infants, it has been shown to be greatest in this cohort compared to full-term infants delivered by caesarean section (dominated by Firmicutes) or pre-term infants (dominated by Proteobacteria) at one week old [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Interestingly, by week 24, no significant differences in alpha diversity were recorded between any of these groups [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]). Diversity increases with age with a gradual increase in the presence of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes by the first year [

 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] (Swedish infants) where the introduction of solid food to the diet has been identified as an important step in the succession of the microbiota [

 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] (Danish infants). In terms of metabolic function, genes involved in the 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> biosynthesis of folate have been shown to be enriched in the infant microbiome across three different populations (Malawian rural communities, Amerindians from the Amazonas of Venezuela, families from the USA) relative to adults [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. By three years of age, obligate anaerobes have been shown to dominate the microbiota in breast-fed infants [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] which is trending towards an adult-like composition. The establishment of a stable adult-like microbiota occurs between 2â€“5 years of age and is dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes [
