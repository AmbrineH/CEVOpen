<p class="p">Humans encounter their initial gut microbiota in very early life with most studies focusing on colonisation after birth and the microbial assembly that ensues. Some studies have led to the hypothesis that colonisation begins in utero by providing evidence of a placental microbiome in healthy pregnancies, the presence of microorganisms in the amniotic fluid and meconium. These studies have been presented and critically assessed in a recent review by Perez-Muňoz et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to date to support the ‘in utero colonisation hypothesis’, since the studies lacked appropriate controls for contamination, the molecular approaches used were incapable of studying low-biomass microbial populations and evidence of bacterial viability was not provided. Thus, for the purpose of this review, we have focused on gut microbiota development from birth onwards.
