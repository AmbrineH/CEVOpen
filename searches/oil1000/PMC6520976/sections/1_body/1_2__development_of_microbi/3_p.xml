<p class="p">Few studies have specifically investigated the pre- adolescent and adolescent microbiota of healthy humans. However, those which have investigated these age groups indicate that the microbiota has not yet reached the adult-state and is providing essential functions towards the developmental process of its human host. The gut microbiota of children is more stable than that of infants with composition largely influenced by dietary habits and geography [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The pre-adolescent microbiota (7–12 years of age) is still in a state of immaturity and based on observations from a group of children from Houston, Texas, has been shown to be more diverse and harbor significantly greater abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria than observed in healthy adults [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The pre-adolescent microbiome was also found to be enriched in functions potentially involved in ongoing development, such as vitamin B12 synthesis and de novo folate synthesis relative to the adult microbiome. In terms of the adolescent microbiota, Agans et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] identified a core microbiota of 46 species common to both adults and adolescents (11–18 years) who consumed a standard Western diet, however, the abundances of the genera
