<p class="p">Interestingly, the centenarian microbiota (99–104 years) has been shown to significantly differ from that of young adults (25–40 years) and even elderly subjects (63–76 years) [

 <italic class="italic">F. prausnitzii</italic> and relatives. Increased inflammatory markers were also identified in centenarian blood samples, indicative of increased inflammatory status. Rampelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] also reported a rearrangement in Firmicutes in Italian centenarians (99–102 years), which was not observed in 70-year-old subjects. In this study a functional description of the coding capacity of an ageing human cohort revealed a decrease in saccharolytic potential and an increased abundance of proteolytic functions in the centenarian microbiome. Remarkably, a study investigating the semi-supercentarian microbiota (105–109 years old) revealed not only a decrease in saccharolytic butyrate producers (

 <italic class="italic">Coprococcus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic>) and an increase in potential opportunistic bacteria, as expected, but also an enrichment and/or higher prevalence in health associated bacterial groups, including 
 <italic class="italic">Akkermansia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Christensenellaceae</italic>. Whether these species were present at a younger age or related to past lifestyle or genetics is not known [
