<p class="p">In certain regions of the world, “healthy” ageing is the norm and the average lifespan of residents surpasses general averages. Goatian village in Liuyang city of Hunan province in mid-South China is such an example, which boasts an average lifespan of 92, much higher than the average 74.83 years for China in general, along with a lack of chronic diseases amongst its people. An analysis of the gut microbiota in its long-living elderly residents (ages spanning from 50 to &gt;90 years) revealed much greater species diversity than that observed in the control group (healthy subjects from other areas in China, average age of 50 years) [

 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] reported that the overall gut microbiota composition of healthy aged Chinese subjects was similar to that of much younger people, reporting little differences between individuals from 30 to &gt;100 years which the authors speculate may be a consequence of the healthy lifestyle and diet of the study subjects.
