<p class="p">Another “trendy” diet type that shapes the microbiome is the gluten-free diet. De Palma et al. [
 <xref rid="B291-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">291</xref>] showed that a 30-day gluten-free diet decreased populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> while increasing unhealthy bacteria, such as 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacetriaceae</italic> that could further increase the risk of infection by opportunistic bacteria. Others, such as Bonder et al. [
 <xref rid="B292-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">292</xref>] found reductions in 
 <italic class="italic">R. bromii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia faecis</italic> coupled to increased 
 <italic class="italic">Victivallaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiaceae</italic> in individuals consuming a gluten-free diet. Whilst a gluten-free diet is an effective therapy for treating patients diagnosed with celiac disease it is often associated with a number of health issues and nutritional deficiencies. Interestingly, over the last 5–10 years, there has been an increasing number of healthy, non-celiac individuals following gluten-free diets and do so under the impression that such a diet is healthier for them when paradoxically it may be increasing their risk of the similar health issues and nutrient deficiencies as those commonly seen in those with celiac disease.
