<p class="p">The study of the gut microbiome has been revolutionised over the last 15 years by advances in genetic methods and sophisticated bioinformatic tools. Next generation sequencing is a low-cost, high-throughput sequencing platform that enables analysis of all the genomes within an ecosystem sample (shotgun metagenomics), or a description of the taxa within a given community by sequencing conserved marker genes, such as the 16srRNA gene of bacteria and archaea (marker gene metagenomics) thus removing the requirement for cultivation of clonal cultures [

Indeed, such is the interest in the gut microbiota, it has been reported that in 2017 alone, approximately 4000 research papers on the topic were published, with more than 12,900 papers published in the preceding four years [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and to date the bacterial component has received the most attention. This vast array of data has contributed to a deeper understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease, the factors which shape it, and the potential to harness its therapeutic potential for optimal health.
