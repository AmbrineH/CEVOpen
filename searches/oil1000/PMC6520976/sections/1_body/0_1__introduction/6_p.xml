<p class="p">In Part I, we describe the development of the gut microbiota throughout life along with the factors that shape its composition and how it contributes to host health. We look at dietary practices and specific dietary components that influence the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota and the consequences for human health with a focus on infection, inflammation and metabolic disease. In Part II, we focus on the potential use of the microbiome to prevent disease and promote health. We present research regarding opportunities to modulate the microbiota for prevention of over- and under- nutrition through probiotics, prebiotics and fibre and we look at the impact of environment and life-stage on the gut microbiota and health and dietary strategies and interventions for optimising health. Finally, in Part II, we provide evidence from recent research that the gut microbiome has potential to serve as a biomarker of human responsiveness to diet and assess where this current knowledge-base places us in terms of putting precision microbiomics into everyday practice and discuss the value of present-day commercial microbiome testing.</p>
