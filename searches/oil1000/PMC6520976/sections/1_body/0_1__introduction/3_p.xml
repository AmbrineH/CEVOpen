<p class="p">The gut microbiota serves the host by interacting directly or indirectly with host cells, the latter of which comes about through microbially-produced bioactive molecules, thus the microbiota is capable of regulating numerous biological pathways involved in immunity and energy homeostasis, while also protecting the host against pathogens through colonisation resistance. The dysbiotic microbiota, which has deviated from the ‘healthy’ status in terms of diversity and functionality, has been implicated in a range of diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) [

Indeed, greater economic development has been shown to correlate with significantly lower within-host gut microbiota diversity, a common feature of the dysbiotic microbiota [
