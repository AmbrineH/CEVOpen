This is unsurprising given that the entire genetic content of the human gut microbiota, commonly referred to as the gut microbiome, is estimated to exceed human genomic content by a factor of â‰¥100 [

It is composed of the three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (fungi, protozoans and metazoan parasites), as well as eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses (bacteriophages).
