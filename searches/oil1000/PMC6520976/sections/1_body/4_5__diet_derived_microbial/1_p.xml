<p class="p">Metabolic disease refers to any disease in which the normal metabolic processes in the body are disrupted and examples include obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Obesity and overweight are described as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that negatively impacts health [
 <xref rid="B216-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>] and according to the WHO, obesity has tripled since 1975. Indeed, in 2016, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were described as overweight and 13% as obese [

Obesity results from ingestion of excess energy which does not get expended and is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the latter of which is characterised by high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance and relative lack of insulin [

 <xref rid="B219-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">219</xref>] estimated that 422 million adults had diabetes, of which the majority were inflicted with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic dyslipidaemia which describes high levels of triglycerides in blood plasma, increased levels of small, dense, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is associated with insulin resistance and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetic individuals [

Metabolic syndrome describes the abnormal metabolism of glucose and lipids and is characterised by abdominal obesity along with two or more of the following factors: reduced HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, high blood pressure and increased fasting blood glucose [
