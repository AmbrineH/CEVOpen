 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cresol, serum indoxyl sulfate is problematic for chronic kidney disease patients. Barreto et al. [
 <xref rid="B267-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">267</xref>] reported that baseline indoxyl sulfate levels presented an inverse relationship with renal function and a direct relationship with aortic calcification in chronic kidney disease patients. While the causative relationship between indoxyl sulfate and the pathology of cardiovascular disease has not yet been proven, studies to date suggest its actions are linked to multiple NADPH oxidase-mediated redox signalling pathways which have been implicated in different forms of cardiovascular disease pathophysiologies, including coronary calcification, atherosclerotic vascular disease, arrhythmia, and chronic heart failure [
