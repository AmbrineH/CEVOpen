<p class="p">Trimethylamine (TMA) is a microbial metabolite generated from dietary choline, as well as the choline derivative betaine, lecithin, and L-carnitine [
 <xref rid="B238-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">238</xref>]. Red meat, dairy products, eggs and salt-water fish are rich sources of choline, lecithin and carnitine [
 <xref rid="B240-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">240</xref>]. Gut microbes known to be involved in TMA production include members of the families 
 <italic class="italic">Deferribacteraceae, Anaeroplasmataceae, Prevotellaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Enterobacteraceae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B240-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">240</xref>,
 <xref rid="B241-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>,
 <xref rid="B242-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">242</xref>,
 <xref rid="B243-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">243</xref>]. The microbially-produced TMA crosses the intestinal epithelial cells, enters the circulation and is transported to the liver where it is converted to the uremic toxin, trimethylamine-
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-oxide (TMAO) mainly by the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3) [
 <xref rid="B244-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">244</xref>]. Elevated plasma TMAO levels derived from microbial metabolism of the lipid phosphatidylcholine have been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans [
 <xref rid="B245-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">245</xref>]. In the same study, dietary supplementation of mice with TMAO or choline was found to promote atherosclerosis and studies with germ free mice indicated the significance of the gut microbiota and dietary choline in TMAO production, increased macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation. Gut microbial-derived production of TMAO from L-carnitine, which is abundant in red meats, has also been confirmed in humans, suggesting a mechanism for the link between dietary red meat ingestion and accelerated atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B241-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">241</xref>]. Interestingly, in the same study dietary supplementation of mice having intact intestinal microbiota with TMAO was shown to reduce the expression of key liver enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis, as well as a number of liver bile acid transporters which resulted in significant decreases in the total bile acid pool and decreased reverse cholesterol transport. The interaction between consumption of dietary components, TMAO levels and various disease endpoints may be affected more by interindividual variations in TMAO production than consumption of the dietary components themselves [
 <xref rid="B246-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">246</xref>]. Additionally, there is significant variability in one of the key enzymes (FMO3) involved in TMAO production (can be 20–30× difference between individuals) making it difficult to generalise and draw conclusions about diet and disease endpoints in regard to TMAO production. TMAO has also been shown to induce inflammatory markers in mice and in human aortic endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells owing to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal kinase, and the NF-κB signalling cascade, and it promoted recruitment of activated leukocytes to endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B247-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">247</xref>]. It has also been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome [
 <xref rid="B248-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">248</xref>]. The link between plasma TMAO levels and the gut microbiota in humans was further confirmed following phosphatidylcholine challenge (ingestion of two hard-boiled eggs and deuterium [d9]-labelled phosphatidylcholine) in the presence and absence of broad-spectrum antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B249-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">249</xref>] whereby plasma TMAO levels were suppressed after antibiotic administration but reappeared after withdrawal of antibiotics. Furthermore, the study confirmed the link between elevated TMAO plasma levels and increased risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular events. The metabolite has also been associated with disease severity and survival of patients with chronic heart failure [
 <xref rid="B250-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">250</xref>], and was shown to cause platelet aggregation in humans receiving a choline supplement for two months thus revealing a link between TMAO and risk of thrombosis [
 <xref rid="B251-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">251</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 prospective studies found an association between elevated plasma TMAO levels and its precursors (L-carnitine, choline or betaine) with increased risks of major adverse cardiovascular events and death, independent of traditional risk factors [
 <xref rid="B252-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">252</xref>]. Higher plasma TMAO levels were also found to be associated with diabetes [
 <xref rid="B253-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">253</xref>]. Interestingly, however, a structural analogue of choline, namely 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), was able to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation by cultured microbes, by physiological polymicrobial cultures (intestinal contents, human faeces), and reduce TMAO levels in mice fed a high carnitine or choline diet [
 <xref rid="B254-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">254</xref>]. In the same study, DMB also inhibited choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein e-/- mice without altering circulating cholesterol levels. This study provides a specific example of a therapeutic approach towards the treatment and prevention of a metabolic disease through direct manipulation of gut microbiota metabolism.
