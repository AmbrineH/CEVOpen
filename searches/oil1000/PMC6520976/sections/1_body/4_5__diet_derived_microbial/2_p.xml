<p class="p">The association between the gut microbiota and regulation of energy storage in the body was initially documented in mice. Indeed, germ free mice are protected against the obesity that usually develops after consuming a Western-style, high fat, sugar rich diet [
 <xref rid="B222-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">222</xref>]. Conventionalisation of adult germ-free mice with a normal microbiota from conventionally raised animals resulted in a 60% increase in body fat and insulin resistance within 14 days [
 <xref rid="B223-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">223</xref>]. The obesity-resistance phenotype of germ-free animals fed a high fat diet was attributed to increased excretion of lipids and reduced calorie consumption [
 <xref rid="B224-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">224</xref>]. The interactions between high fat diet and the gut microbiota in mice were shown to promote pro-inflammatory changes in the small intestine which preceded weight gain and obesity and also showed significant associations with obesity progression and development of insulin resistance [
 <xref rid="B225-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">225</xref>]. In terms of microbiota composition, an increased abundance of Firmicutes and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes has been reported in obese mice compared to their lean counterparts [
 <xref rid="B226-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">226</xref>]. It has been suggested that such a microbiota may be more efficient at generating energy in the form of SCFAs from the diet thus contributing to weight gain [
 <xref rid="B227-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">227</xref>]. Differences in gut microbiota composition and functionality have also been recorded in humans between obese and lean people. Ley et al. [
 <xref rid="B228-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">228</xref>] reported a decrease in the relative proportion of Bacteriodetes in obese people relative to their lean counterparts and which was found to increase on calorie-restricted diets. This observation was also corroborated by Turnbaugh et al. [
 <xref rid="B229-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">229</xref>] who also noted a higher proportion of Actinobacteria in obese subjects. Furthermore, faecal SCFA concentrations tend to be higher in obese individuals [

 <xref rid="B231-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">231</xref>,

 <xref rid="B233-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">233</xref>]. The obese gut microbiota has also been characterised by reduced diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways [
 <xref rid="B229-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">229</xref>]. More recently, a systematic review investigated the link between the gut microbiota and low-grade inflammation, a hallmark of obesity which plays a major role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans [
 <xref rid="B234-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">234</xref>]. Fourteen, mostly observational studies were included with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 10 to 471 participants. Higher white blood cell counts and high sensitivity C reactive protein levels were associated with lower gut microbial diversity, and the abundances of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> were inversely linked to different markers of low-grade inflammation. Compositional and functional differences have been observed in the gut microbiota of type 2 diabetes individuals which included a moderate degree of microbial dysbiosis, reduction in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria, an increase in opportunistic pathogens, and an increase in microbial functions conferring oxidative stress resistance [
 <xref rid="B235-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">235</xref>,
 <xref rid="B236-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">236</xref>]. In apparently healthy participants, Kashtanova et al. [
 <xref rid="B237-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">237</xref>] reported an association between compromised metabolic status, lower gut microbial alpha diversity, and higher representation of opportunistic pathogens and as a consequence propose that the “gut-heart axis” may be involved in the very early stages of cardiovascular disease. These studies clearly illustrate the link between the gut microbiota and metabolic disease of which certain microbial metabolites undoubtedly play a significant role [
