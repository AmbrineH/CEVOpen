<p class="p">The branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine and valine represent three of the nine essential amino acids. As well as being building blocks of protein synthesis, the BCAAs are involved in nutrition metabolism, regulation of energy homeostasis, gut health, immunity and disease [
 <xref rid="B271-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">271</xref>]. Our gut microbiome has been shown to be enriched with genes involved in the biosynthesis of essential amino acids, including the BCAAs [
 <xref rid="B272-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">272</xref>]. While BCAAs are not precisely ‘diet-derived’ microbial metabolites, a recent study linking microbial BCAAs to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance renders them worthy of mention. Indeed, Pedersen et al. [
 <xref rid="B273-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">273</xref>] reported that the serum metabolome of insulin-resistant individuals was characterised by increased levels of BCAAs which correlated with a gut microbiome with enriched biosynthetic potential for BCAAs. Transfer of 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella copri</italic> to mice, one of the main species driving the association between BCAA synthesis and insulin resistance, increased circulating levels of BCAAs, induced insulin resistance and aggravated glucose intolerance. The authors state that further studies are required to determine how the intestinal BCAAs enter the bloodstream and from what intestinal location. However, elevated circulating BCAA levels and their breakdown products have been positively associated with insulin resistance in humans. A metabolic signature related to BCAA catabolism in obese subjects which included circulating BCAAs and downstream products of their catabolism (acylcarnitines and glutamate) was identified in “healthy” obese subjects free of diabetes or other serious illnesses [
 <xref rid="B274-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">274</xref>]. These obese subjects were also more insulin resistant compared to their lean counterparts. In the same study, animals fed a high fat diet supplemented with BCAAs had reduced food intake and weight gain compared to the high fat diet alone but became equally insulin resistant as those on the high fat diet. The authors proposed a pathway of dysregulated BCAA metabolism as a result of overnutrition of protein which leads to insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and eventually type 2 diabetes. A systematic review of 23 studies involving 20,091 participants found that circulating BCAAs are a useful biomarker for detection of insulin resistance and diabetic risk later on [
 <xref rid="B275-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">275</xref>]. A causal role of BCAA metabolism in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes was reported following a large-scale human genetic and metabolomic study [
 <xref rid="B276-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">276</xref>]. Therefore, modulation of the microbiota to influence BCAA levels could represent a potential route towards the prevention of insulin resistance and its associated aetiologies.
