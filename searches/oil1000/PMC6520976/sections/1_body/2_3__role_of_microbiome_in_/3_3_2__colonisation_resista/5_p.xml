<p class="p">Other antimicrobials generated by the gut microbiota can also aid colonisation resistance. For example, a single bacterial species, namely 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium scindens</italic>, was shown to confer colonisation resistance against 
 <italic class="italic">C. difficile</italic> infection 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> [

 <italic class="italic">C. scindens</italic> from host-derived bile cells were found to inhibit the pathogen.
