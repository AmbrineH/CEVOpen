<p class="p">Members of the established microbiota are controlled by ‘substrate competition,’ defined as the superior ability of a species/strain to utilise one or a few substrates over other species and the control of that population by the limited concentration of these substrates [
 <xref rid="B129-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. Furthermore, one microorganism’s by-product can serve as substrate for another [
 <xref rid="B127-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. In this regard, nutrient resources in the gut are in huge demand and simultaneously limited, making it challenging to become established or outcompete with resident microbiota. Indeed, nutrient utilisation by the colonic microbiota of mice was shown to restrain the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium difficile,</italic> since it was incapable of competing with the mouse microbiota for the available carbon sources [
 <xref rid="B130-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. Unfavourable environmental conditions created as a result of commensal fermentations can also inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. The utilisation of human milk oligosaccharides, particularly the dominant secretor associated oligosaccharide 2′-fucosyllactose, by infant strains of bifidobacteria led to an increase in their proportions, an increase in lactate concentration and a subsequent reduction in pH which was shown to decrease the proportions of 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium perfringens</italic> during 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> anaerobic fermentations [
 <xref rid="B131-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. Furthermore, consumption of butyrate by epithelial cells as an energy source has been implicated as important in maintaining a hypoxic environment in the gut lumen [
 <xref rid="B132-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. Decreased intestinal butyrate levels due to depletion of a commensal butyrate producer in a mouse model resulted in increased epithelial oxygenation and aerobic expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium [
 <xref rid="B133-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>]. Butyrate has also been shown to down-regulate virulence gene expression in 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> [
 <xref rid="B134-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>].
