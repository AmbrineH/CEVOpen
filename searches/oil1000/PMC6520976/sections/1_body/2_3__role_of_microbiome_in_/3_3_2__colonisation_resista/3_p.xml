<p class="p">In terms of niche competition, Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B135-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>] identified specific colonisation factors conserved within the 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> genus, one of the most prominent genera of the human microbiota. The specific genetic locus referred to as 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>ommensal 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>olonisation 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>actors (
 <italic class="italic">ccf</italic>) was shown to be up-regulated in 
 <italic class="italic">Bac. fragilis</italic> during gut colonisation, especially at the colonic surface such that the strain was able to reside deep within the crypt channels whereas 
 <italic class="italic">ccf</italic> mutants were defective in terms of crypt association. Such species-specific physical interactions with the host provide an example of direct competition for niche occupation.
