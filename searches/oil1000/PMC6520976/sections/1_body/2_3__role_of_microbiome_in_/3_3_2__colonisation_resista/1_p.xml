<p class="p">The intestinal microbiota protects its host against colonisation by exogenous pathogens and prevents the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic endogenous members, referred to as colonisation resistance [
 <xref rid="B127-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. This phenomenon is elicited through competition for nutrients and colonisation sites, direct inhibition of pathogens through the production of antimicrobial substances, and indirectly through modulation of the luminal environment and via host-commensal interactions involving the epithelial barrier function, modulation of the host cell surface and the host immune system [
