 <xref rid="B137-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesised peptides with antimicrobial activity against either a broad range of species or a narrow range of closely-related species. Their mode of action varies depending on the bacteriocin class, but they generally exert their antimicrobial activity by forming pores in the target cell (Classes I and II), by degrading cell wall peptidoglycan (Class III bacteriolysins) or interfering with cellular processes (Class III non-lytic bacteriocins) [
 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. The genetic machinery for bacteriocin synthesis is encoded in gene clusters or operons where many of the genes are conserved. Based on this knowledge, Walsh et al. [
 <xref rid="B139-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>] identified 74 bacteriocin gene clusters within the genomes of the GIT subset of the Human Microbiome Projectâ€™s reference genome database using an 
 <italic class="italic">in-silico</italic> approach of which the most commonly identified were bacteriolysins, then lantibiotics and sactibiotics. Thuricin CD is an example of a sactibiotic bacteriocin produced by a human gut isolate, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. While it has a narrow spectrum of inhibition, thuricin CD is capable of killing a wide range of 
 <italic class="italic">C. difficile</italic> isolates, its antimicrobial activity being as potent as the antibiotics vancomycin and metronidazole, but without the concomitant damage to other members of the microbiota [
 <xref rid="B141-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. Bacteriocin production can also aid niche occupation of the producing strain. Indeed, bacteriocin production in 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> harboring the bacteriocin-encoding conjugative plasmid pPD1 was shown to replace indigenous enterococci and out-competed 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecalis</italic> strains lacking the plasmid in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="B142-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. Supplementing mice with bacteriocin-producing strains resulted in transient advantageuous changes, such as inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> by enterocins and 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus</italic> by garvicin and promotion of LAB by sakacin, plantaricins and garvicin [
