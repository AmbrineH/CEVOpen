<p class="p">Primary bile acids are produced in the liver from dietary cholesterol and cholesterol derived from hepatic synthesis, and their main function is to aid absorption of dietary lipids and lipid soluble nutrients [
 <xref rid="B99-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. However, bile acids are also important signalling molecules and are known to activate a number of nuclear receptors, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR), preganane X receptor, and vitamin D receptor, as well as the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5, and cell signalling pathways in the liver and GIT thus modulating their own biosynthesis, as well as glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism [
 <xref rid="B100-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. In humans, 200-800 mg of bile acids escape enterohepatic circulation every day, pass into the colon and are metabolised by bacteria to secondary bile acids [
 <xref rid="B99-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. In a mouse model, such secondary bile acids produced through the action of bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) have been shown to regulate weight gain, lipid metabolism and cholesterol levels via regulation of key genes in the liver or small intestine [
