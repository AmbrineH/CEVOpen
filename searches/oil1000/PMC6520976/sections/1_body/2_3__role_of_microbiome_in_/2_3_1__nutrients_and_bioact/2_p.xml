<p class="p">Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) breakdown MACs into fermentable monosaccharides [
 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. For example, the gut bacterium 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> was recently shown to metabolise the most structurally complex plant polysaccharide known, rhamnogalacturonan-II, using a highly specific enzyme system [
 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium longum</italic> strains derived from the infant gut were shown to be capable of metabolising human milk oligosaccharides [
 <xref rid="B72-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. In-silico analysis of CAZyme profiles in the guts of 448 individuals from diverse geographies and age groups revealed 89 CAZyme families which were present across 85% of the gut microbiome and revealed several geography/age-specific trends in the CAZyme repertoires of individuals [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. The major end products of microbial fermentation of the resulting monosaccharides are the SCFAs, including butyrate, propionate, and acetate which reach a combined concentration of 50–150 mM in the colon at a ratio of 1:1:3, respectively [
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. They are rapidly absorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells where they are involved in a number of cellular and regulatory processes [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] with only 5% excreted in faeces [
 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Butyrate is mainly produced by Firmicutes, propionate by Bacteroidetes, and acetate by most gut anaerobes [
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Butyrate is the main energy source for the epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B79-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] and plays an important role in brain function [
 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. It is also known for its anti-cancer [
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] and for its role in the development of the intestinal barrier [
 <xref rid="B85-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Propionate contributes to gluconeogenesis in the liver [
 <xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] and, along with butyrate, has been shown to activate intestinal gluconeogenesis, albeit both use different circuits [
 <xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Propionate derived from the gut microbiota has also been shown to reduce cancer cell proliferation in the liver [
 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. The SCFAs are also involved in regulating immune responses, a topic which has been extensively reviewed by Corrêa et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. For example, acetate has recently been shown to promote intestinal antibody IgA responses to the gut microbiota via the G protein coupled receptor GPR43 [
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Intestinal IgA is specialised in protecting the mucosa [
 <xref rid="B92-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. These SCFAs also stimulate secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and plasma peptide YY (PYY) involved in appetite regulation and satiety from enteroendocrine cells [
 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] proposedly through the SCFA receptors GPR41 and GPR43 [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], thus playing a role in energy regulation in the body. Unsurprisingly, changes in the production of these compounds as a result of disturbances to the gut microbiota can result in pathological consequences for the host. As an example, increased acetate production from an altered gut microbiota in a rodent model was shown to promote metabolic syndrome [
