 <xref rid="B123-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>] showed that intestinal inflammation in mice harbouring a microbiota incapable of metabolizing tryptophan was attenuated following treatment with 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> strains capable of activating AhRs through the production of tryptophan metabolites. In the same study, faecal samples from healthy subjects induced significantly greater AhR activation compared to faecal samples from IBD subjects, the latter of which harbored significantly less tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites. The tryptophan-metabolising strain 
 <italic class="italic">Peptostreptococcus russellii</italic> provided a protective effect against colitis in mice, which the authors suggest is linked to its ability to produce the tryptophan metabolite and AhR ligand, indoleacrylic acid which mitigates inflammatory responses and promotes intestinal barrier function [
 <xref rid="B124-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. The authors also noted a diminishment of tryptophan-metabolising capacity in stool samples of IBD patients. The metabolite indole has been shown to enhance epithelial barrier function and attenuate indicators of inflammation [
