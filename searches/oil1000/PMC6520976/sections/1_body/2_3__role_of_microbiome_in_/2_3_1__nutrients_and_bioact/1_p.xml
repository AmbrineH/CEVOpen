<p class="p">Fruits, vegetables and cereals are major components of the human diet providing essential carbohydrates and dietary fibres, although digestion of the latter is beyond the scope of the human genome [
 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Cantarel et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] identified only 17 enzymes within the human genome to breakdown carbohydrate nutrients which included starch, lactose and sucrose. Thus, plant cell wall polysaccharides and resistant starch, which constitute most dietary fibres and cannot be digested or absorbed in the small intestine, enter the large intestine and undergo microbial breakdown and subsequent fermentation [

The microbiota also feeds on animal-derived dietary carbohydrates (glycosaminoglycans and N-linked glycans from cartilage and tissue), host epithelial glycome, and microbe-derived carbohydrates from resident gut microbes or foodborne microbes [
