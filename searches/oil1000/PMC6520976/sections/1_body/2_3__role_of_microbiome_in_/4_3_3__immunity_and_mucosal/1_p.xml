<p class="p">Commensal interactions with the host promote immune system maturation and immune homeostasis through complex microbiota-host networks although much of our understanding of these mechanisms today have been extrapolated from animal or

 <xref rid="B147-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. We have already seen how several microbial metabolites play essential roles as signalling molecules for the immune system, such as the SCFAs and tryptophan metabolites. More specifically, a polysaccharide (PSA) produced by 
 <italic class="italic">Bac. fragilis</italic> was shown to promote cellular and physical maturation of the developing immune system in mice [
 <xref rid="B148-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. Interestingly, this species is an early colonizer of the infant gut [
 <xref rid="B149-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>] and plays an important role in the development of the infant immune system. A 15 kDa protein produced by 
 <italic class="italic">F. prausnitzii</italic>, a commensal microbe deficient in Crohn’s disease patients, was shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, decreasing activation of the NF-κB pathway and also prevented colitis in an animal model [

 <xref rid="B151-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>]. Rios et al. [
 <xref rid="B151-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">151</xref>] showed that efficient induction of IgA is brought about by M-cell sampling of commensal microbes. Paneth cells (a specialized intestinal epithelial lineage) sense enteric bacteria through activation of the MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor which results in the induction of several antimicrobial factors that are essential for controlling bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier [
 <xref rid="B152-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">152</xref>]. Colonisation by segmented filamentous bacteria was shown to induce the maturation of T-cell responses in a gnotobiotic mouse model, suggesting these microbes could play a role in the postnatal maturation of the gut immune system [
 <xref rid="B153-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. These studies provide a snapshot of how commensals modulate host immunity. The importance of the microbiota for host immunity can also be appreciated from the consequences of its absence in germ free animals. Indeed, germ free animals exhibit reduced expression of IgA and antimicrobial peptides and are deficient in Peyers’ patches [
