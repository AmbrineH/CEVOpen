<p class="p">Goblet cells are specialised epithelial cells that secrete mucus, composed primarily of O-glycosylated proteins called mucins, resulting in the formation of a mucus layer whose composition and density is influenced by the commensal microbiota [

Germ free mice have been shown to have an extremely thin colonic mucus layer which can be restored to levels observed in conventional mice following exposure to bacterial products, including peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide [
