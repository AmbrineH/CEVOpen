<p class="p">The gut microbiome is integral to the health of its host, serving a myriad of functions. It provides essential nutrients and bioactive metabolites, which can be produced directly by the microorganisms or indirectly by microbial conversion of host or environmental molecules. It is involved in energy regulation (as discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-nutrients-11-00923" class="xref">Section 5</xref>). It prevents pathogen colonisation directly or indirectly through a phenomenon referred to as colonisation resistance. It sustains the integrity of the mucosal barrier and is an essential component in the orchestration of immune functioning within the gut. The bidirectional interactions within the brain-gut-microbiome axis, in which the gut microbes communicate to the central nervous system, have been demonstrated largely by preclinical and some clinical studies [
 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Alterations in brain-gut-microbiome communication have been implicated in various disease states, from irritable bowel syndrome to psychiatric and neurologic disorders, and this is an area of research that has the potential for identification of novel therapeutic targets and therapies [
