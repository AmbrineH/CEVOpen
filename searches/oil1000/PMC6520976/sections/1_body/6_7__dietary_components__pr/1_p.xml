<p class="p">Protein, carbohydrate and fat are macronutrients required in large amounts to maintain bodily functions and to provide energy for the body. FAO/WHO recommends that daily dietary fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake, protein should account for 10–15%, and carbohydrate should account for the remainder (between 55–75%). Dietary fibre intake is recommended at 25 g/day for women and 38 g per day for men [

However, the proportions of these macronutrients in the typical Western diet are skewed towards high-energy and low nutrient-dense foods containing large amounts of saturated fat and sugar, and fibre intake has been reported to be as low as 15 g/day in 90% of the population in developed countries [
