 <xref rid="B337-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">337</xref>]. Studies investigating the direct impact of protein on gut microbiota composition and functionality have shown that protein quantity, quality, processing history (which impacts on protein digestion, presentation and overall function) and source must be taken into consideration. For example, a high protein diet (45% protein, 30% carbohydrate) fed to Wistar rats had detrimental effects on the colonic microbiota compared to a normal protein diet (20% protein, 56% carbohydrate) [

 <xref rid="B339-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">339</xref>]. Sulfate-reducing bacteria increased by 2.59 fold which correlated with increased sulfide. There was also an increase in spermine which has been shown to be extremely toxic in rats [
