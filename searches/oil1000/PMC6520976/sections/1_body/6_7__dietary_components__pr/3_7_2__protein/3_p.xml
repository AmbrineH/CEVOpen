<p class="p">Interestingly in humans, a three-week isocaloric supplementation with casein, soy protein or maltodextrin, which served as control, had no impact on the gut microbiota but altered bacterial metabolite production [
 <xref rid="B361-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">361</xref>]. Compared to maltodextrin, both soy protein and casein caused a decrease in faecal butyrate which the authors suggest may be due to the combination of an increase in protein intake and a decrease in indigestible carbohydrate intake. Amino acid metabolites increased on the high protein diet owing to protein degradation by the gut microbiota. These metabolites included the faecal concentration of 2-methylbutyrate and the urinary concentration of the host-microbiota co-metabolites phenylacetylglutamine and indoxyl sulfate. Casein specifically increased p-cresol sulfate. Transcriptome analysis of rectal biopsies revealed changes in gene expression associated with mucosal homeostasis maintenance on the two protein diets, albeit the transcriptome profiles differed between the two, which the authors suggest is due to exposure to different bacterial metabolites resulting from the different proteins. However, mucosal inflammation was not induced on these diets and faecal water cytotoxicity was not altered either. The authors suggest that high protein diets should be considered with some caution given the changes observed in gene expression in the rectal mucosa and that protein source must also be taken into account. More recently, a low protein diet (0.6 g/kg/day) for six months was reported to reduce serum uremic toxin levels, including p-cresol sulfate, in non-dialysis, chronic kidney disease patients [

The low protein diet was also associated with an improvement in renal function and a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol. A position paper by the MyNewGut Study group analysed PubMed-referenced publications involving human intervention studies to clarify beneficial versus deleterious effects of high protein diets on metabolic and gut related health parameters, including interactions with the gut microbiota [
 <xref rid="B363-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">363</xref>]. The study concluded that high protein diets are generally associated with decreased body weight and improvement in blood metabolic parameters but they also modify various bacterial metabolites and co-metabolites in faecal and urinary contents. The effects on the gut microbiota were heterogeneous depending on the type of dietary intervention. The effects of high protein diets on the gut microbiota were dependent on protein source (plant versus animal) and this should be considered for future investigations and some caution should be exercised around high protein diets, particularly as long-term or recurrent dietary practices. Note: Processing of protein, including thermal processing, and its impact on protein function, including modulation of the microbiome is not fully understood and requires further investigation.
