<p class="p">Protein source or type has also been shown to impact gut microbiota composition, given that the amino acid composition differs between types. A 14-day feeding trial in rats fed either protein from soy, pork, beef, chicken, fish and casein, (the latter served as a control) revealed changes by day 2 particularly between red meat (pork and beef) and white meat (fish and chicken). Principal component analysis revealed distinct microbiota on days 7 and 14, whereby the soy protein group was separate from the meat and casein groups [
 <xref rid="B347-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">347</xref>]. In another similar study, soy protein was associated with increased faecal SCFAs in rats compared to rats fed white meat, red meat or casein [
 <xref rid="B348-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">348</xref>]. The soy group also had a higher relative abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> which are the major propionate and other SCFA producers [
 <xref rid="B349-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">349</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>, a genus known for its beneficial effects was increased in the gut microbiota by ingestion of meat proteins. In this study, the diets clustered into two subgroups at the phylum level, the ‘meat class’ and the ‘non-meat class.’ In another study, soy fed hamsters were found to have a more consistently diverse microbiota in the small and lower intestine compared to hamsters fed milk protein isolate and the largest differences were found within the Bacteriodetes phylum [
 <xref rid="B350-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">350</xref>]. Indeed, the milk protein isolate fed group had a greater relative abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonadaceae</italic> compared to the soy fed groups. Those fed partially hydrolyzed soy protein isolate revealed a bloom of 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> across most intestinal sections and a higher proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiales</italic> spp. in the cecum compared to the milk protein isolate fed group. Bifidobacteria are well known beneficial microbes and commensal members of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridiales</italic> are now known to be involved in maintenance of overall gut function [
 <xref rid="B351-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">351</xref>]. The milk protein isolate fed group had a greater abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Erysipelotrichacaea</italic> in ileum and faecal samples which has been associated with dyslipidemic phenotypes in humans [
 <xref rid="B352-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">352</xref>] and hamsters [
 <xref rid="B353-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">353</xref>]. Plasma lipids were significantly reduced in the soy fed hamsters compared to those that received milk protein isolate, owing at least in part to the gut microbiota changes induced by soy protein [
 <xref rid="B350-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">350</xref>]. Under a high fat diet regime, soybean protein isolate reduced high fat diet induced weight gain and adipose tissue mass accumulation and attenuated hepatic steatosis in mice which was not observed for dairy protein [
 <xref rid="B354-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">354</xref>]. An increased cecal bile acid pool was observed in the soybean group with an elevated secondary: primary bile acid ratio, along with an enhancement in the secretion of GLP-1. This was accompanied by an expansion of taxa proposed to be involved in bile acid biotransformation. These effects were abolished in germ free mice suggesting that the metabolic benefits of soy protein are due to the microbiota alterations which bring about increased bile acid transformation and secretion of GLP-1. Likewise, tartary buckwheat protein proved capable of preventing dyslipidemia in mice fed a high fat diet which was not observed for casein [
 <xref rid="B355-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">355</xref>]. The buck wheat protein inhibited the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and promoted the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Enterococcus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic>, the latter of which was closely related to plasma lipids. Excretion of total bile acids and SCFAs were significantly increased in faeces from mice fed buckwheat. Mungbean protein also proved superior to casein in reducing high fat diet induced weight gain in mice [
 <xref rid="B356-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">356</xref>]. The mungbean protein caused elevated secretion of GLP-1, an increase in the cecal and faecal bile acid pool with a dramatically elevated secondary: primary bile acid ratio; effects which were abolished in germ free mice. In terms of the gut microbiota, mungbean consumption as part of the high fat diet resulted in an expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcaceae</italic>, a family known to have BSH activity [
 <xref rid="B357-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">357</xref>] and caused an increase in taxa belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum and a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes [
 <xref rid="B356-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">356</xref>]. Whey protein extract has been shown to increase diversity, 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> populations while decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B358-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">358</xref>,
 <xref rid="B359-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">359</xref>]. Similarly, pea protein extract has been shown to increase diversity, 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> populations [
 <xref rid="B360-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">360</xref>]. These studies clearly suggest that plant-derived proteins are superior to animal-derived proteins for promoting a beneficial microbiota with positive effects on host metabolism.
