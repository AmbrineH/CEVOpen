<p class="p">Trans fats contain unsaturated fatty acids with at least one double bond in the 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> configuration. In industry, they are formed during the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats (vegetable oils), a process performed to generate semi-solid fats for use in commercial cooking, margarines and manufacturing processes [

These fats, also referred to as partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) have a long shelf life and can be customised to enhance palatability of sweets and baked goods and thus are an attractive ingredient for food manufacturers [
 <xref rid="B316-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">316</xref>]. However, their consumption is associated with increased risk of disease, such as cardiovascular disease [

 <xref rid="B317-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">317</xref>], and Alzheimerâ€™s disease [
 <xref rid="B318-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">318</xref>]. Carvalho et al. [
 <xref rid="B319-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">319</xref>] investigated the impact of PHOs on gut microbiota in mice in the presence of whey protein hydrolysate or casein as a protein source. The PHOs had minimal impact on the gut microbiota and were hardly able to invert the Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio but preserved the normal pattern.
