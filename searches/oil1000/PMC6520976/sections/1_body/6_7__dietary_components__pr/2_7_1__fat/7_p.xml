<p class="p">The ketogenic diet, defined as a high fat and low carbohydrate diet, has been effectively used as a therapeutic treatment for a number of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, depression, autism, traumatic brain injury and depression, as examples [
 <xref rid="B330-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">330</xref>]. Recently, researchers have revealed that the protective effects of the ketogenic diet could be mediated via the gut microbiota based on studies in mice [

 <xref rid="B332-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">332</xref>]. The ketogenic diet administered by Ma et al. [
 <xref rid="B331-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">331</xref>] consisted of 75.1% fat composed of SFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs. Following 16 weeks on the diet, mice revealed several neurovascular enhancements with potential to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease which could be associated with the observed gut microbiota changes which included an increase in beneficial bacteria, including

 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> and a reduction in pro-inflammatory microbes 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrio</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Turicibacter</italic>. The gut microbiota changes observed by Olson et al. [
 <xref rid="B332-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">332</xref>] in mice receiving the ketogenic diet were found to be required for the protective effects of the diet against acute electrically induced seizures and spontaneous tonic-clonic seizures. In this case, 
 <italic class="italic">Akkermansia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Parabacteriodes</italic> were significantly increased and enrichment of, and gnotobiotic colonisation with these microorganisms were capable of restoring seizure protection in germ-free mice or mice treated with antibiotics. Additionally, in a mouse model of glioma, mice fed the ketogenic diet had slightly increased survival compared to mice fed the control diet and showed significant differences in several key microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B334-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">334</xref>] thus increases in blood ketone levels could be responsible for the observed gut microbiota changes [
