<p class="p">Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a collective term describing isomers of linoleic acid (LA) and while the latter has double bonds in the 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> configuration located at carbons 9 and 12, CLA can have either the 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic> configuration or both located along the carbon chain [
 <xref rid="B320-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">320</xref>]. Unlike the 
 <italic class="italic">tran</italic>s fats described earlier, CLA has been associated with numerous beneficial properties based primarily on results from animal models and cell lines, including protection against cancer, obesity and atherosclerosis, as well as immunomodulation which has been reviewed by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B321-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">321</xref>]. The most bioactive isomers of CLA are 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-9, 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-11 CLA and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-10, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 CLA [
 <xref rid="B321-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">321</xref>]. Supplementing mice with dietary 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-10, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 CLA for eight weeks resulted in significantly lower proportions of Firmicutes and higher proportions of Bacteroidetes compared with the control group which received no supplementation [
 <xref rid="B322-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">322</xref>]. Gut microbiota composition was significantly altered with higher proportions of the family 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonadaceae</italic> and decreased abundance of families 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrionaceae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyromonadaceae</italic> has been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice [
 <xref rid="B323-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">323</xref>], a manifestation of metabolic syndrome in the liver [
 <xref rid="B324-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">324</xref>]. The family has also been associated with cognitive impairment in cirrhosis patients, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</italic> abundance was reported to be lower in cirrhosis patients [
 <xref rid="B325-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">325</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</italic> has also been shown to protect mice against 
 <italic class="italic">C. difficile</italic> colonisation [
 <xref rid="B326-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">326</xref>] and most recently has been suggested to play a protective role against colorectal cancer [
 <xref rid="B327-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">327</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrionaceae</italic> contains the sulfite-reducing species 
 <italic class="italic">Bil. Wadsworthia</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Desulfovibrionaceae</italic> has also been associated with impaired glucose tolerance and most serious metabolic syndrome phenotypes in mice [
 <xref rid="B328-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">328</xref>]. Thus, the results of the study indicate that gut microbiota alterations following long-term supplementation of the 
 <italic class="italic">tr</italic>ans-10, 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-12 CLA isomer could be detrimental to health. However, given that CLA supplements are commercially available, the authors suggest that fatty acid mixtures with equal proportions of CLA isomers or probiotics and prebiotics may balance such negative effects [
 <xref rid="B322-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">322</xref>].
