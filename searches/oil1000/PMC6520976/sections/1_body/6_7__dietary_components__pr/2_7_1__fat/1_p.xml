<p class="p">Dietary fat is composed mainly of triglycerides where each triglyceride molecule contains a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached [
 <xref rid="B295-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">295</xref>]. Some dietary fats reach the colon after escaping absorption in the small intestine. Indeed, we have already seen that an animal-based diet high in fat and protein alters the gut microbiota resulting in an increase in the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Bilophila</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alistipes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>] and long-term consumption selects for a 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides</italic> enterotype [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Recently, Agans et al. [
 <xref rid="B296-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">296</xref>] directly investigated if typically consumed dietary fatty acids alone could sustain the growth of the human gut microbiota using an 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> multi-vessel simulator system of the human small intestine. Switching from a balanced Western diet type medium to one lacking carbohydrates and proteins resulted in substantial changes to the microbiota and metabolites produced. Several specific genera increased in abundance, including 
 <italic class="italic">Alistipes, Bilophila</italic> and several genera within the class Gammaproteobacteria. Increased abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Alistipes</italic> has been correlated with a greater frequency of pain in paediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome [
 <xref rid="B297-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">297</xref>], has been found in patients with major depressive disorder [
 <xref rid="B298-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">298</xref>] and has been associated with type 2 diabetes [
 <xref rid="B236-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">236</xref>]. We have already seen that 
 <italic class="italic">Bil. wadsworthia</italic> was increased in humans consuming the animal-based diet [
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>] and is associated with inflammation owing to its hydrogen sulfide-producing capabilities [
 <xref rid="B187-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> is a member of Gammaproteobacteria which also harbours many pathogenic members, including 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Yersinia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> [
 <xref rid="B299-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">299</xref>]. The abundances of well known glycan and protein degraders, including 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroides, Clostridium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia</italic> decreased in the fats-only medium and there was also a decrease in the production of antioxidants and SCFAs, a concomitant decrease in the abundance of glycan-degradation genes, and an increase in the abundance of genes coding for fatty acid degradation enzymes and anaerobic respiratory reductases [
 <xref rid="B296-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">296</xref>]. Overall, the results show that the gut microbiota is capable of utilising dietary fats typical of the Western diet but the resulting changes may negatively impact human health. In mice, Murphy et al. [
 <xref rid="B300-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">300</xref>] showed that high fat feeding of mice was more influential for altering gut microbiota composition than genetically induced obesity, generating a progressive increase in Firmicutes which reached statistical significance. In another study, high fat feeding of mice was shown to decrease the proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcaceae</italic>, which are known to utilise plant polysaccharides, and to increase the proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">Rikenellaceae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B301-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">301</xref>], of which the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Alistipes</italic> is a member. The results also suggested that high fat feeding altered overall cellular composition within the abundant bacterial groups, namely, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidales</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Lachnospiraceae</italic> based on cecal chemical fingerprints analysis. Metaproteome analysis revealed a decrease in proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and a shift towards amino acid and simple sugar metabolism. This is in agreement with Yatsunenko et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] who reported that metagenomes associated with the Western diet are enriched in amino acid and simple sugar degrading enzymes relative to African populations consuming diets rich in complex carbohydrates. More recently, Vaughn et al. [
 <xref rid="B302-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">302</xref>] reported that a high fat diet fed to Sprague-Dawley rats increased the Firmicutes: Bacteriodetes ratio and increased proliferation of pro-inflammatory 
 <italic class="italic">Proteobacteria</italic> which were found to be toxic to vagal afferent neurons in culture. Overall, the results suggest that high fat-diet-induced shifts in gut microbiota could disrupt vagal gut-brain communication ultimately leading to increased accumulation of body fat.
