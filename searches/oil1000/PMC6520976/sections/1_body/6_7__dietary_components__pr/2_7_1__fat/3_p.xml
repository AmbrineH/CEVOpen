<p class="p">Interestingly, transgenic mice constitutively producing omega 3-PUFAs fed a high fat/high sucrose diet displayed higher phylogenetic diversity in the cecum compared to wild-type mice fed the same diet [
 <xref rid="B315-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">315</xref>]. The transgenic mice were protected from obesity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis and maintained a normal gut barrier function unlike wild-type mice. Transplantation of the faecal microbiota from the transgenic mice to the wild-type mice reversed their weight gain and normalised their glucose tolerance and intestinal permeability. The authors concluded that the omega-3 mediated changes to the gut microbiota were involved in the prevention of metabolic syndrome in the transgenic mice.
