<p class="p">The quantity of dietary carbohydrates entering the colon each day has been estimated at approximately 40 g [
 <xref rid="B364-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">364</xref>]. We have already seen that a carbohydrate-rich diet (fibre and plant-derived polysaccharides) results in a microbiota which is dominated by the 
 <italic class="italic">Prevotella</italic> enterotype [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] and is enriched in polysaccharide degrading members with increased SCFA production [
 <xref rid="B180-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">180</xref>,
 <xref rid="B365-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">365</xref>,
 <xref rid="B366-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">366</xref>,
 <xref rid="B367-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">367</xref>,
 <xref rid="B368-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">368</xref>,
 <xref rid="B369-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">369</xref>]. However, dietary carbohydrates which enter the colon can be categorised as resistant starch, non-starch polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, as well as some di- and monosaccharides [
 <xref rid="B370-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">370</xref>], and as with the other macronutrients, amount and type of carbohydrate has an impact on the gut microbiota. Resistant starch is an important non-digestible carbohydrate, of which there are four types, (RS1 to RS4) [
 <xref rid="B371-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">371</xref>,
 <xref rid="B372-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">372</xref>]. A diet high in type 3 resistant starch for 10 weeks was found to stimulate the growth of Firmicutes bacteria related to 
 <italic class="italic">R. bromii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Eub. rectales</italic> in human volunteers [
 <xref rid="B181-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>], both of which possess amylolytic activity [
 <xref rid="B373-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">373</xref>,
 <xref rid="B374-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">374</xref>], and 
 <italic class="italic">Eub. rectales</italic> members are major butyrate producers [
 <xref rid="B375-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">375</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. were found to increase dramatically in one volunteer in response to the resistant starch used in this diet. In contrast, non-starch polysaccharides (wheat bran) presented little evidence of changes to the faecal microbiota, which the authors state may be attributable to the smaller increase achieved for non-starch polysaccharides (1.5 fold) compared to a 4.8 fold increase in resistant starch [
 <xref rid="B181-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>]. Interestingly, of the 14 volunteers, &gt;60% of the resistant starch remained undigested in two compared to &lt;4% in the remaining 12 volunteers highlighting the significance of the initial microbiota composition. Mart√≠nez et al. [
 <xref rid="B376-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">376</xref>] revealed that resistant starch types 3 and 4 differentially affected the microbiota in human volunteers following consumption of each for three weeks in a double-blind cross-over study. In this case, resistant starch type 4 induced changes at the phylum level resulting in a decrease in Firmicutes and an increase in Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. At the species level, resistant starch type 4 increased 
 <italic class="italic">Bif. adolescentis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Para. distasonis</italic>. In three subjects, resistant starch type 4 induced a 10-fold increase in bifidobacteria. Resistant starch type 2 significantly increased 
 <italic class="italic">R. bromii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Eub. rectales</italic> compared to resistant starch type 4. Importantly, the responses to the resistant starches and their magnitudes varied between individuals but were reversible and tightly associated with resistant starch consumption. This interindividual variation was also reported by Venkataraman et al. [
 <xref rid="B377-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">377</xref>]. In this case, resistant starch type 2 increased faecal butyrate in a cohort of 20 young healthy individuals but responses varied widely such that individuals could be categorised into three groups based on butyrate levels before and during resistant starch consumption: enhanced, high, and low. In the enhanced group, faecal butyrate increased by an average of 67% which coincided with a dramatic increase in the relative abundance of resistant starch-degrading organisms, including 
 <italic class="italic">Bif. adolescentis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">R. bromii</italic> in most individuals (increasing from 2% to 9%) and 
 <italic class="italic">Eub. rectales</italic> in almost half of these individuals. In the high group, levels of butyrate remained the same before and during resistant starch consumption. In this group, resistant starch-degrading microorganisms increased in abundance, suggesting the resistant starch was degraded, but there was no concomitant increase in butyrate levels which the authors suggest may be due to these individuals experiencing a plateau effect owing to the fact that they are performing well in terms of butyrate production. In the low group, butyrate levels were low before resistant starch consumption began and did not improve during the trial. The resistant starch degrading bacteria in the low group did not increase from an initial abundance of ~1.5% suggesting their microbiota did not degrade the resistant starch which the authors state may be due to the presence of antagonistic microbes or lack of synergistic microbes. More recently, Vital et al. [
 <xref rid="B378-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">378</xref>] reported that distinct parts of the microbiota work together to degrade resistant starch (type 2 in this study) and successively form health-promoting end products. In this case, resistant starch degradation was governed by Firmicutes whereby 
 <italic class="italic">R. bromii</italic> degradation of the resistant starch provided fermentation substrates and increased acetate concentrations to support the growth of major butyrate producers. H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-scavenging sulphite reducers and acetogens also increased. Again, the individual responses varied with the observed pattern reported for seven of the twelve participants, while four showed mixed responses and one individual remained unresponsive.
