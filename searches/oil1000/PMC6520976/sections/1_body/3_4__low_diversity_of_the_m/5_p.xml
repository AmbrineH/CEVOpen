<p class="p">The link between inflammation and low microbiota diversity was corroborated in a study involving 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals [
 <xref rid="B193-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">193</xref>]. Within this collective group of 292 subjects, two groups could be differentiated by the number of gut microbial genes and thus bacterial richness. The ‘low gene count’ (LGC) group represented 23% of the total population studied and included a significantly higher proportion of obese subjects. The LGC group was characterised by a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype, marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia. Obese individuals within the LGC group were found to gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species were sufficient to distinguish between the LGC group and the ‘high gene count’ (HGC) group but interestingly anti-inflammatory species, such as

 <xref rid="B194-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>] were more prevalent in HGC individuals while potentially pro-inflammatory species associated with IBD,

 <xref rid="B197-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>], were more frequently found in LGC individuals. In an accompanying intervention study involving 49 obese and overweight subjects of whom 40% was defined as LGC, a similar phenomenon in terms of clinical parameters and inflammatory status was observed such that the authors concluded that LGC individuals are at increased risk of obesity-associated co-morbidities [
 <xref rid="B177-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>]. Members of the LGC group were found to consume fewer fruits and vegetables and fewer fishery products than the HGC group. An energy-restricted diet with increased fibre intake for six weeks resulted in an increase in microbial gene richness in the LGC group which approached but remained significantly different to that of the HGC group. Both groups showed a loss in body fat mass and an improvement in clinical phenotypes (lipid and insulin levels and insulin resistance) and a trend towards a decrease in inflammation (as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein) though the effects were more pronounced for the HGC group. Although this was a short-term intervention study, it suggests that measures of gene richness and microbial diversity may help predict the efficacy of interventions. Furthermore, it seems that long term improvements to dietary habits may be required to improve and stabilise gut microbial diversity which agrees with the observations of Klimenko et al. [
 <xref rid="B179-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>] who reported considerable correlations between long-term dietary habits and gut community structure.
