<p class="p">That diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota has been confirmed in several studies [

 <xref rid="B183-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>]. Even short-term dietary changes (four days) have been shown to alter human gut microbiota composition [
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>]. In this particular study, David et al. [
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>] reported that the entirely animal-based diet (meats, eggs and cheeses) had a greater impact on gut microbiota composition than the plant-based diet (grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables), resulting in a decrease in plant polysaccharide-metabolising Firmicutes (
 <italic class="italic">Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ruminococcus bromii</italic>) and an increase in the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms presumably owing to the increase in bile acid secretion as a result of high fat intake [
 <xref rid="B184-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">184</xref>]. Indeed, the animal-based diet significantly increased the levels of faecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid produced by microbial dehydroxylation of bile, and has been shown to promote liver cancer in mice [
 <xref rid="B185-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>], and inhibit the growth of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes members in rats [
 <xref rid="B186-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. Microbial genes required for DCA production exhibited significantly higher expression on the animal-based diet. Furthermore, the abundance and activity of the sulfite-reducing bacterium, 
 <italic class="italic">Bilophila wadsworthia</italic>, was also shown to be increased on the animal-based diet.
