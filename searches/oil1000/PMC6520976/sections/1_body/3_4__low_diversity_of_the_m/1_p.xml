<p class="p">Dysbiosis is a term used to describe imbalances in gut microbiota communities and is linked with disease when these imbalances negatively impact microbiota functions required for health or when they promote disease occurrence [
 <xref rid="B164-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">164</xref>]. For a number of these diseases, the dysbiotic state is manifested as a reduction in microbial diversity and often an increase in facultative anaerobes relative to the ‘healthy’ gut microbiota [

Such diseases tend to primarily inflict those living a Westernised lifestyle and consuming a Western diet which is characterised by low fruit and vegetable intake and high consumption of animal-derived protein (meat and processed meat), saturated fats, refined grains, sugar, salt, alcohol and corn-derived fructose [

 <xref rid="B176-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>] suggest the argument for a causal effect is strong in the case of several human conditions, a stance we concur with in terms of inflammation and infection based on the body of research presented here.
