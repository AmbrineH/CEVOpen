<p class="p">Loss of microbial diversity is also associated with increased risk of infection, presumably due to loss of colonisation resistance. For example, human studies have shown that the presence of the gut pathogen 
 <italic class="italic">C. difficile</italic> is associated with decreased gut microbiota diversity in CDI patients [

 <xref rid="B199-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>]. Gu et al. [
 <xref rid="B201-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>] also reported a dramatic increase in endotoxin-producing opportunistic pathogens and lactate-producing phylotypes in CDI patients. Community richness and diversity were significantly lower in the gut microbiota of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA)-positive patients compared to individuals without MRSA [
 <xref rid="B202-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>]. The alpha diversity of the gut microbiota of children suffering from acute infectious diarrhoea caused by rotavirus was significantly less diverse than those of healthy children [
 <xref rid="B203-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>]. In this case, probiotic intervention for five days resulted in recovery from diarrhoea. By day 3, diarrhoea symptoms had ceased, by days 10 and 30 after the intervention, microbiota diversity had increased to the point that it was no longer significantly different from healthy children. Future studies are required to determine the exact role of the microbiota in diarrhoea-related processes. Other viral infections have also been associated with low-diversity dysbiosis, including hepatitis C [
 <xref rid="B204-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>] and HIV [
