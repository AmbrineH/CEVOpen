<p class="p">Furthermore, Sonnenburg et al. [
 <xref rid="B210-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>] showed that in the absence of dietary polysaccharides, a human gut microbe turned to host mucus glycans as a nutrient source. Mouse models have shown that a defective mucus barrier enables contact between epithelial cells and bacteria resulting in spontaneous colitis in mice [
 <xref rid="B211-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>], a feature shared with sufferers of ulcerative colitis [
 <xref rid="B212-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. But a direct connection between dietary fibre and the status of the colonic mucosal barrier was more recently presented in a mouse study by Desai et al. [
 <xref rid="B213-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">213</xref>]. In this study, a dietary-fibre deprived gut microbiota resorted to host-secreted mucus glycoproteins, which resulted in the erosion of the colonic mucus barrier and enabled the gut pathogen 
 <italic class="italic">Cit. rodentium</italic> greater access to the epithelial cells, resulting in lethal colitis. In another study, mice fed a Western style diet presented with an altered gut microbiota composition that resulted in increased permeability and reduced growth rate of the inner mucus layer compared with mice fed a CHOW diet [
 <xref rid="B214-nutrients-11-00923" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>]. However, administration of 
 <italic class="italic">Bif. longum</italic> or the fibre inulin prevented mucus defects. Inulin prevented penetrability of the inner colonic mucus layer while 
 <italic class="italic">Bif. longum</italic> restored mucus growth.
