Overall microbial gene expression was strongly linked to diet, thus as expected, the animal-based diet resulted in lower levels of carbohydrate fermentation end-products, the SCFAs. Despite the increase in dietary fibre, four days of the plant-based diet did not increase the microbiota diversity of participants, most likely owing to the short time frame. Two days after the animal-based diet ended, the gut microbiota of participants reverted to their original structure. In a study investigating the associations between long-term dietary habits and lifestyle, and short-term dietary changes, with gut microbiota composition, Klimenko et al. [
