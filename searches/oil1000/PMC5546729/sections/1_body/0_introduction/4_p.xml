<p class="p">The desirable effect of 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> on human diseases may be due to the presence of active compounds (ie, polyunsaturated fatty acids, TQ, phenolic compounds, and other natural anti-oxidants) in 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> oil composition. 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> seed contains 26.6% oil, of which the major fatty acids are linoleic acid (LA, 64.6%) and palmitic acid (20.4%) as reported in a previous study.

 <xref rid="b18-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref> also found that LA was the major unsaturated fatty acid in 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> (50.3% “Tunisian 
 <italic class="italic">NS</italic>” and 49.2% “Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">NS</italic>”). It was found that 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> seeds contain 36%–38% fixed oils, proteins, alkaloids, saponin, and 0.4%–2.5% essential oil, and it was reported that the 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> essential oil is mainly composed of TQ (27.8%–57.0%), ρ-cymene (7.1%–15.5%), carvacrol (5.8%–11.6%), t-anethole (0.25%–2.3%), 4-terpineol (2%–6.6%), and longifolene (1.0%–8.0%).
 <xref rid="b19-dddt-11-2221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref> Fatty acid profiles were identified for 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> seed oils. Also LA and oleic acids are the main fatty acids of 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> essential oil. In addition, the 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> essential oil contains considerable amounts of myristic acid (C14:0), arachidic acid (C20:0), and behenic acid (C22:0).
