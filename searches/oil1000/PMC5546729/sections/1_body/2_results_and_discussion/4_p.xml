<p class="p">The results indicate that the LA of Indian 
 <italic class="italic">N. sativa</italic> oil extracted by SFE method was higher than the fatty acid contents measured for the other samples; while the essential oil extracted from Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">sativa</italic> seeds using solvent extraction technique (methanol) contained the highest TQ content (21.03%) compared to TQ recorded in the other samples. The present results are in agreement with the results of previous researchers
