<p class="p">Primary metabolism in avocado and other oily fruit undergoes large changes during growth, development, and ripening; thus, the reaction networks or metabolic pathways involved are quite similar, still the set of regulations that directly affect the metabolic fluxes to different destinations remains largely unknown (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beauvoit et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, in this review, we aim to: (1) delve into the importance of primary metabolism on quality impact for avocado and (2) provide a deep review of avocado fruit primary metabolism (cell wall, carbohydrates, oil, amino acids, and organic acids) with a main emphasis on studies on carbohydrate and oil metabolism.
