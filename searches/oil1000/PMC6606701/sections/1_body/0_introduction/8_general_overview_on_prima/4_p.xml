<p class="p">Hormones are crucial during fruit growth and development. Cytokinins and gibberellins are involved in early events after pollination. Fruit growth and development are controlled by coordination of different plant hormones. Up to date, except for a recent study on tomato (
 <xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2019</xref>), information is very limited related to the link between hormonal signals and primary metabolite changes during fruit development and ripening. Auxins and gibberellins promote cell division and expansion, thus influence fruit size. At fruit set, auxins and gibberellins impact the genes involved in primary metabolism (
 <xref rid="ref110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ruiu et al., 2015</xref>). Ethylene and abscisic acid become important for fruit maturation since they tightly control fruit ripening in climacteric fruit. The role of these hormones in avocado ripening has been extensively reported.
