<p class="p">The most integrative studies on primary metabolism comprising information at different levels of cellular control (e.g., genes, proteins and metabolites) orchestrated by hormones have been carried out with tomato as considered as “model fruit.” Major carbon source for fruit is usually sucrose, which is imported from the leaves to the phloem; however, avocado is unusual in which high contents of C

Unlike other fruit in which the balance of sugars and organic acids is determinant of fruit quality, for avocado, the content of oil and profile of fatty acids is determinant of fruit quality.
