<p class="p">Firmness is a very important quality parameter of avocado and as such is highly influenced by the composition and architecture of the cell wall. During growth, the cell wall protects and shapes the fruit, and then during ripening its disassembly has strong implications in quality perception and shelf-life. It has been reported that partial cell wall degradation at the ripe stage can provide sugars (e.g., uronic acids), which are phosphorylated and recycled
