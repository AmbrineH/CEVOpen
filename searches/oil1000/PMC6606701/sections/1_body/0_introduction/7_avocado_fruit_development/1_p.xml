<p class="p">Avocado fruit follows a single sigmoid curve. Independent of the cultivar (early or late maturing cultivars), the early period of growth is characterized by a rapid cell division (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barmore, 1977</xref>). Cell division in the fruit mesocarp goes beyond the initial period of growth but continues during fruit development and continues even in the mature fruit attached to the tree (

 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bower and Cutting, 1988</xref>). Avocado is a climacteric fruit characterized by an increase in the respiration rate and ethylene production at the onset of ripening. Compared with other climacteric fruits, avocado produces high amounts of ethylene (80–100 μl kg
