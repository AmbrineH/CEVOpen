<p class="p">Avocado fruit development period is quite extensive, between 6 and &gt;12 months from flowering to maturity (
 <xref rid="ref114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Scora et al., 2002</xref>). Unlike other fruits that accumulate carbohydrates during growth and development, avocado accumulates mostly oil. Avocado mesocarp fruit starts oil accumulation a few weeks after the fruit sets and oil accumulation continues during growth and development until maturation (
