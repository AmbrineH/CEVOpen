<p class="p">Cold storage is extensively used by the avocado producers to improve the postharvest viability by delaying ripening-associated softening of avocados. In refrigerated storage, the cell wall of avocados continues to undergo modifications such as degradation of pectins by PG, PME, and β-Gal activities and cellulose degradation by endoglucanase activity at a slower rate (

 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Defilippi et al. (2018)</xref> determined that the activity of PG and β-Gal increased in avocadoes after cold storage compared to harvest, which correlates with the depolymerization of HG and the solubility of pectin polysaccharides and reduction of flesh firmness. However, although this cold storage technology is critical in influencing avocado softening delay, there is insufficient information describing the cell wall changes in pectins, hemicellulose, and cellulose that contribute to the firmness loosening in cold-stored avocados.
