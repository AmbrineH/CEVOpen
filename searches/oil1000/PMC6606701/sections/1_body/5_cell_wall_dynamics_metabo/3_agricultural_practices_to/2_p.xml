<p class="p">The use of plant growth regulators (PGR) is a common practice in some tree fruit handling. One of the most studied PGR in fruit ripening and softening is ethylene because it plays a crucial role in the development of climacteric fruits by initiating and coordinating the ripening process (
 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jeong and Huber, 2004</xref>). Thus, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) binds to the ethylene receptor and prevents this gas from having a physiological effect (

 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Defilippi et al. (2018)</xref> described that treatments with 1-MCP can extend the postharvest life of the avocado, delaying the enzymatic activity of PG, PME, and β-Gal. Likewise, 
 <xref rid="ref120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tateishi et al. (2007)</xref> described that during treatments with 1-MCP, the β-Gal activity is delayed due to negative transcriptional regulation of these genes, impacting directly in the galactosidase proteins. Furthermore, the endoglucanase activity is also repressed during the treatments with 1-MCP, altering the composition and structure of the polysaccharides conforming the cell wall (
