<p class="p">Avocados undergo a dramatically softening of the mesocarp during its climacteric period, and these changes in mesocarp firmness are accompanied by changes in skin color, influencing the fruit quality and storability (
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Garc√≠a-Rojas et al., 2016</xref>). Fruit softening is primarily associated to a cell wall disassembly attributed to modifications induced by ripening with an impact in the primary cell wall polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brummell, 2006</xref>). There is a consensus in the literature on the conformation of the primary cell walls of plants, including fruits, which corresponds to a pectin matrix and a cellulose-xyloglucan network (

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caffall and Mohnen, 2009</xref>). It is well known that cell wall structure can have an impact on fruit texture (
