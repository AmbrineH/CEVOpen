<p class="p">Hemicelluloses correspond to cell wall polymers that interact with cellulose (
 <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayashi and Kaida, 2011</xref>) and pectins (
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fasoli et al., 2016</xref>). Hemicelluloses are conformed by linear chains of glucose, xylose, and/or mannose and possess different side chains involving these monosaccharides and fucose or arabinose. Xyloglucans are the most important polysaccharides in the fraction of hemicelluloses of the primary wall of dicots (
 <xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nishinari et al., 2007</xref>). In avocados, little is known about the hemicellulose dynamics during softening. Nevertheless, it has been reported that endoglucanase could play an essential role in xyloglucan remodeling (

 <xref rid="ref93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oâ€™Donoghue and Huber, 1992</xref>). Another cell wall enzyme, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase participates in the remodeling of hemicelluloses (
