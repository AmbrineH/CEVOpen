<p class="p">Pectins are mainly composed of homogalacturonans (HG), rhamnogalacturonan type I and II (RG-I and RG-II, respectively;

The content of galacturonic acid decreases significantly throughout the softening. These changes in GalA content have been correlated with an increase in the PG activity (
