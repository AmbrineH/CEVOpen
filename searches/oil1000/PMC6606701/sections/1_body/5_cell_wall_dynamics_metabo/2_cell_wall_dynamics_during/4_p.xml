<p class="p">Expansins promote the elimination of hydrogen bonds between cellulose and hemicellulose fibers, and indirectly the degradation of pectins by increasing access to pectin remodeling enzymes (

Similarly, to pectin-degrading enzymes, cellulase detection and activity increase during avocado softening, changing the elastic properties of cellulose matrix (
