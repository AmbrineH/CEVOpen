<p class="p">The combination of “omics” techniques such as metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics would help to better understand the processes that occur in avocado fruit as it has been used in other plant species (

A transcriptomic analysis revealed an increase in the expression of different gene clusters associated to cell wall macromolecule catabolic processes during avocado ripening, inducing changes in the composition of the cell wall. Moreover, genes involved in cell wall biogenesis showed a decreased expression during ripening (
 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ibarra-Laclette et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, a recent transcriptomic study during avocado fruit development described that genes codifying cell wall structural proteins showed a constantly decreased expression through fruit development, suggesting a role of these genes in avocado fruit firmness. These genes are homologs to proline-rich proteins (PRPs), which constitute a large part of the cell wall structural proteins (
 <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vergara-Pulgar et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, certain metabolomic studies have been developed in the understanding of the biology and evolution of this fruit (

 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), the description of processes from the secondary metabolism (

 <xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meléndez-González and Espinosa-García, 2018</xref>), and the ripening process of avocado (
 <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pedreschi et al., 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, there is a lack of information regarding the interactions between avocado cell wall remodeling, fruit development and postharvest modifications and changes regarding variety, agronomical cultural practices, and postharvest technology. Alternatively, these changes may impact on the cell wall metabolism that later translates into avocado firmness evolution. Therefore, by having physiological data and omics information (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), we will be able to correlate these data with the firmness properties of the fruit, which will provide more precise ideas about the changes in the processes studied and their impact on the quality of avocados.
