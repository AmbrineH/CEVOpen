 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref>, reported up to 34 different lipase genes during five developmental stages of which four corresponded to monoacyl glycerol lipases (MAGL) and two to triacylglycerol lipases (TAGL). Two MAGL genes did not present changes in expression during the five developmental stages, while two other MAGL tended to decrease in expression as the developmental stage advanced. For the TAGL genes, no differences in expression were observed for the five developmental stages. These results confirm reduced expression of lipases during oil accumulation and furthermore during maturation, which confirms previous studies that reported no changes in oil content and fatty acid profile during avocado ripening.
