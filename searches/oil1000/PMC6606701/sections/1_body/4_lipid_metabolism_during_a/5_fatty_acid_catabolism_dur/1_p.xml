<p class="p">Fatty acids to be further utilized by most lipid metabolic enzymes need to be thioesterified by long chain acyl CoA synthases (LACS). Nine different isoforms of LACS have been identified in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> and in avocado mesocarp, transcripts for the ortholog of LACS4 have been reported as most abundant followed by LACS8, LACS1, and LACS9 (
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al., 2015</xref>). More than 80% of the transcripts of LACS orthologs were represented by the ER-associated isoforms (LACS1, LACS4, and LACS8) and only 16% by the ortholog of plastidial LACS9 in avocado mesocarp. Thus, it remains to be elucidated which of the LACS contributes to acyl activation and where it happens. In addition, orthologs of peroxisomal LACS6 and LACS7 were barely detectable in avocado mesocarp during fruit development. Thus, these results suggest that fatty acids undergo little β-oxidation during mesocarp development (

 <italic class="italic">via</italic> peroxisomal β-oxidation, and it is supposed to operate during lipid synthesis or incorporated into triacylglycerols
