<p class="p">Avocado lipids can be divided into (1) neutral lipids or also called triacylglycerols (TAGs), fats or oils (tri, di, and monoacylglycerols); (2) phospholipids; and (3) glycolipids. The neutral lipid fraction constitutes 96% of the total lipid content of avocado, mainly are TAGs. TAGs composed of 18:1, 18:2, 16:0, and 16:1 fatty acids are present, and the relative concentration (percentage of total lipid) of each is in the range 59–81% (18:1), 7–14% (18:2), 7–22% (16:0), and 3–11% (16:1). It is important to point out the differences in lipid content and profile in the mesocarp, exocarp, and seed in different cultivars of avocado. For instance, 
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galvao et al. (2014)</xref> reported average mesocarp fat contents (g/100 g) of 16.2, 13.6 and 11.9 for Fortuna, Collinson and Barker cultivars. Average seed fat contents (g/100 g) for the same cultivars corresponded to 1.8, 2.5, and 2.1, respectively and average fat content of the peel corresponded to 0.9, 1.7, and 1.1, respectively, for Fortuna, Collinson and Barker cultivars. In terms of fatty acid composition of the mesocarp except for Barker that presented a higher % of SFA, in the other cultivars Fortuna and Collinson, MUFA were the predominant fatty acids. The seed instead of Fortuna was characterized by a higher relative content of SFA followed by PUFA and MUFA, but the other two cultivars presented a higher proportion of PUFA followed by SFA and MUFA, respectively. The exocarp instead of the three avocado cultivars was characterized by a higher relative content of MUFA followed by SFA and PUFA, respectively.
