 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> indicate based on this transcriptomic data that for oil rich tissues and diverse species, a conserved common stoichiometry and temporal regulation of transcripts with oil accumulation holds. However, only some orthologs of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in avocado were similar to that of monocots and dicots. The orthologs expressed in avocado for PDHC-E1β (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1β enzyme), HAD (HAD superfamily, subfamily IIIB acid phosphatase), and FATA (acyl ACP thioesterase A) were different than the one predominantly expressed in oil rich tissues of monocots and dicots. Thus, 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> reported more than 60% of the transcripts encoding for fatty acid biosynthesis pathway belonged to stearoyl ACP desaturases (SAD/DES) and to ACP and their expression increased with the maturity of the mesocarp. ACP transcripts represented 24% of the total fatty acids synthesis gene expression, transcripts that mapped to ACP4 (acyl carrier protein 4, plastid) were by far the most abundant in avocado while the other four isoforms were barely detectable.
