<p class="p">At least six different metabolic pathways requiring the activation of over 200 genes are involved in oil metabolism in avocado fruit (

 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, sucrose to be converted into TAG requires the degradation of sucrose and generation of pyruvate in the plastid requiring the active participation of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and plastid transporters and the synthesis of fatty acids in the plastid and TAG assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. It consists of three events: (1) production of the glycerol backbone; (2) formation of fatty acids or fatty acyl moieties; and (3) esterification of glycerol with the fatty acid components to yield TAGs (

 <italic class="italic">De novo</italic> fatty acids synthesis takes place in the plastid, acetyl-CoA is needed as precursor and it is derived from sucrose and by the action of two key enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, palmitate, stearate, and oleate are formed as main products. These fatty acids are then exported to the cytosol where they are activated to Acyl-CoAs and further modified. The desaturases introduce double bonds, and elongases elongate the fatty acid chain length. 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> reported for Hass avocado at five different developmental stages high expression of transcripts levels for the orthologs of ribulose 1,5 biphosphate carboxylase (RBC), phosphoribulokinase, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEPC) in avocado mesocarp, and it was consistent with their suggested role in carbon assimilation. In addition, same authors reported high expression of sucrose synthase (SuSy) in the cytosol during mesocarp development and highlighted the major role of SuSy in the generation of the hexoses needed for pyruvate synthesis. Starch is the main substrate for glycolysis in the plastids and in the same study of 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref>, transcripts for starch synthesis and degradation gene orthologs were abundant through the different avocado mesocarp developmental stages. It has been previously reported that at early stages of fruit set in avocado, about 44% of the flesh weight is due to sugars which continue to increase during rapid fruit growth but then decline during oil accumulation (
 <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 1999b</xref>). One fourth of total oil content accumulation in avocado has been reported to occur during early stages of development and 
 <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vergara-Pulgar et al. (2019)</xref> have recently reported enrichment of transcripts related to lipid localization, fatty acid synthase activity and acyl carrier activity involved in fatty acid biosynthesis when comparing mesocarp of 150 DAFS (days after fruit set) with 240 DAFS, respectively. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase the regulatory enzyme that controls the rate of fatty acid synthesis and catalyzes the first reaction to generate malonyl-CoA was also detected in avocado and oil palm (
