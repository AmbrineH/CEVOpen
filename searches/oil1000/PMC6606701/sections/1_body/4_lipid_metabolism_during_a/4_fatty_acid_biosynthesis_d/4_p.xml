<p class="p">The expression pattern of stearoyl-ACP desaturase genes in avocado mesocarp reflects its lipid composition according to 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref>. During mesocarp development, transcript levels coding for FAB2 were the most abundant than any other enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis and represented 44% of the total plastidial fatty acid synthesis gene expression and increased during maturation and correlated with the increased oleic acid of avocado mesocarp. This was supported by 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref>, who studied five different developmental stages of Hass avocado (I–V, from 125 to 230 g fresh weight and 4.5–12.5 lipid content fresh weight) and reported 18% of the total lipids to be polyunsaturated during stages I–III and then less than 10% were polyunsaturated in stages IV and V, respectively. The lipid composition agreed with the higher expression levels of LPCAT (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase) and PDAT (phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase) in stages I–III compared to IV and V. Thus, a possible role for acyl editing during early stages of development is proposed and supported by higher levels of transcripts for an ortholog of oleate desaturase (FAD2) during early stages of development (I–III) compared to IV and V respectively. Recently, 
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ge et al. (2019)</xref> reported the fatty acid mesocarp composition during four stages of avocado fruit development (65–125 DAP; corresponding to 9.45–54.75 g of mesocarp mass) and the expression of key genes and regulators of glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. The composition of fatty acids varied at the four stages of development. The concentration of palmitic and palmitoleic acids increased from 65 to 105 DAP followed by a rapid increase until 125 DAP. Oleic acid content only increased after 85 DAP and then increased dramatically by 70 at 125 DAP. Linoleic acid content fluctuated during fruit development and was higher than those of the other fatty acids, but linolenic acid content declined constantly during fruit development. These results showed that the content of palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids all increased during the four stages of fruit development, reaching their maxima at the late stage. In addition, the expression of fatty acid related genes such as 
 <italic class="italic">PaWRI1, PaACP4-1, PaACP4-2,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PapPK-β1</italic> significantly increased during fruit development with maximum expression at 125 DAP. From 65 to 125 DAP, 
 <italic class="italic">PaWRI1, PaACP4-2,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PapPK-β1</italic> displayed a fourfold increase but kept showing significant differences among the four stages of fruit development but 
 <italic class="italic">PaACP4-1</italic> only increased 0.5–1.0-fold expression at 65 DAP and 1.42 fold at 125 DAP. Thus, the observed total fatty acid changes during the four stages of avocado fruit development by 
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ge et al. (2019)</xref> were consistent with the changes of expression of 
 <italic class="italic">PaWRI1, PaACP4-2,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PapPK-β1</italic> but inconsistent with 
 <italic class="italic">PaACP4-1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PaWRI2</italic> expression patterns.
