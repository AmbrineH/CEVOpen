<p class="p">Up to our knowledge, the only complete study based on the avocado transcriptome of

 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2015)</xref>. The transcriptome of avocado fruit from three different ripening stages corresponding to pre-climateric, climacteric and post-climateric was reported. From these data and based on the expression of transcripts related to “fatty acid synthesis” and “fatty acid elongation, desaturation and export” for these three postharvest ripening stages, 
 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2015)</xref> suggested that the initiation of fruit ripening determines the end of oil accumulation and fatty acid composition. Most of the genes expressed in the fruit homologous to fatty acid biosynthesis genes decreased as fruit ripened. These authors reported three homologs (UN066747, UN21149 and UN33083) of FAB2/SSI2 (stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase) (AT2G43710) as differentially expressed unigenes during ripening. FAB2/SSI2 corresponds to the major enzyme that converts stearic acid (C
 <sub class="sub">18:0</sub>) to monounsaturated acid (C
 <sub class="sub">18:1</sub>) in chloroplasts. These results together with those of 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> based on fruit growth and development of avocado support that lipid accumulation and changes in the fatty acid profile such as fatty acid desaturation occur during fruit development, and possibly, this process concludes a few days after harvest (pre-climacteric stage). The evident decrease of FAB2/SSI2 transcripts and genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis during fruit ripening explains the non or minimal changes observed in the fatty acid composition during postharvest ripening of avocado. 
 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2015)</xref> hypothesize ethylene as the signaling molecule once perceived that halts lipid biosynthesis and programs changes in the fatty acid profile.
