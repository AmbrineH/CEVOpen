<p class="p">Minimal change in the fatty acid composition of the mesocarp during postharvest has been reported, and the increased oil concentration during storage and ripening has been related to postharvest dehydration and to increased lipid recovery due to partial cell wall breakdown (

 <xref rid="ref98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pedreschi et al. (2016)</xref> reported no effect of postharvest ripening strategies such as temperature and ethylene on the fatty acid profile and content of Hass avocados. Instead the fatty acid profile is determined during growth and development and highly influenced by temperature, light, and photoperiod. Low temperatures during growth and development have been reported to favor the accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids having oxygen as the limiting factor for desaturases and membrane fluidity limit the activity of desaturases. Several studies have reported differences in the profile of fatty acids of Hass avocado from different origin (

 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">García-Rojas et al. (2012)</xref> reported potential candidate genes involved in loss of quality of late season Hass avocados stored under cold storage grown in Chile and identified stearoyl-ACP desaturase (

 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gudenschwager et al. (2013)</xref> on an attempt to understand darkening of the Hass avocado mesocarp under suboptimal cold storage, studied pattern expression of genes that encode the multi-subunit acetyl CoA carboxylase enzyme (MS-ACCase) as being key enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis and potentially playing a role in membrane synthesis and maintenance. Two MS-ACCase subunits were identified 
 <italic class="italic">in silico</italic>, a biotin carboxylase (BC) and a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Since these two genes (
 <italic class="italic">PamACCase-BC</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PamACCase-BCCP</italic>) were increased in ripe avocados after cold storage, the authors suggested that these genes might be related to cold storage induced physiological disorders in Hass avocado. In addition, several studies have reported that biosynthesis of antifungal compounds in avocado fruit is connected with the activation of fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. Different elicitors (cold temperature, ethylene, and fungal infection) reported by
