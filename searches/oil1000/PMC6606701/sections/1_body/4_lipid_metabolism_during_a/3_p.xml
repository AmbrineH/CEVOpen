<p class="p">Oil content increases in the mesocarp a few weeks after the fruit sets. As oil increases in the mesocarp, water content decreases by the same amount, so that the total percentage of oil and water remains constant during fruit life. Nevertheless, biosynthesis of triglycerides does not start at the beginning of the physiological life of the fruit and can change during fruit development and ripening (
 <xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ozdemir and Topuz, 2004</xref>). Avocado fruit is characterized by the presence of lipid-containing idioblasts, specialized cells, distributed uniformly in the mesocarp, which make up to 2% volume of the edible portion and are characterized by a thick (4 μm) wall consisting of three layers of cellulose, suberin, and lignified cellulose. Idioblasts contain high acetogenin content. Acetogenin profiles are conserved in mesocarp, while seed profiles are dynamic during fruit growth (
 <xref rid="ref106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rodríguez-López et al., 2017</xref>). During avocado fruit development, the mesocarp accumulates by dry weight 60–70% oil and 10% carbohydrates. The oil is stored in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG) and is predominantly composed of oleic acid (

 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al., 2015</xref>) and unlike mature oilseeds, mature avocados cv. Hass can accumulate up to 18% oil in the mesocarp. The avocado seed instead did not present much change in accumulation during growth and development of the fruit (
