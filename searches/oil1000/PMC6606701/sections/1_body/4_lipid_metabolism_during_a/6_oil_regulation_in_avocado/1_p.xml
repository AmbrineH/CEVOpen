<p class="p">Previous studies of oil palm mesocarp revealed WRI1 to be correlated with oil accumulation. In avocado mesocarp, 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> reported in addition to WRI1, transcripts for the isoforms WRI2 and WRI3 to be highly expressed but upstream regulators of WRI1 such as LEC1, LEC2, and FUS3 were not expressed or detected in avocado mesocarp. These results indicate that oil regulation in non-seed tissue is different than in seed tissues.
