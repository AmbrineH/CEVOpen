<p class="p">In avocado mesocarp, the overall expression pattern of WRI1 orthologs was similar to genes WRI1, which regulate ACP, BCCP (biotin carboxyl carrier protein of heteromeric ACCase), KASII (ketoacyl-ACP synthase II), and PDHC (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and the pattern of oil accumulation. In contrast to the role of WRI2 in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> fatty acid biosynthesis, the high expression of this ortholog in avocado mesocarp during oil accumulation suggests a potential role in TAG accumulation in avocado. 
 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ge et al. (2019)</xref> recently reported that while 
 <italic class="italic">PaWRI1, PaACP4-1,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">PapPK-Î²1</italic> seem to play key roles in the accumulation of oil in avocado mesocarp as also reported by 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref>, the pattern of expression of 
 <italic class="italic">PaWRI2</italic> differed indicating that this transcription factor contrary to what was reported by 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> might not be influencing oil accumulation.
