<p class="p">Monosaccharides play a key role in primary metabolism by linking energy derivation by photosynthesis to the demands of anabolic and catabolic processes. Monosaccharides are the substrates for sucrose biosynthesis, the major transportable sugar in most vascular plants (

 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars (mannoheptulose and perseitol) have been reported as the predominant transportable and storage sugars in leaves and fruit of avocado. Still, despite the importance of these C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars, there is only sparse information about the synthesis, metabolism, transport, and physiology of C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars not only in avocado but also in other species where they occur (
