<p class="p">C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars have been postulated as the ripening inhibitors of 
 <italic class="italic">Persea americana</italic> fruit, while attached to the tree (
 <xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 1999a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) based on findings that C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars are phloem mobile, second mannoheptulose is a very potent inhibitor of respiratory processes performing as an hexokinase inhibitor, thus impeding the input of glucose into glycolysis (
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Board et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2002</xref>) and finally based on the inhibition of the ripening process of the fruit until C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars are metabolized to below a certain level in the fruit (
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landahl et al., 2009</xref>). C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars (mannoheptulose and perseitol) may control/trigger the ripening process (
 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landahl et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meyer and Terry, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blakey et al., 2012</xref>), but other studies indicate that additional players are involved (
 <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pedreschi et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuentealba et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuentealba et al. (2017)</xref> reported higher expression of a chloroplastic transketolase enzyme in the mesocarp tissue of slow ripening Hass avocados. Previous works have reported that C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars together with sucrose and C
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> sugars are used during the ripening process (
 <xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 1999b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landahl et al., 2009</xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al. (2002)</xref> reported for mature but unripened fruit, perseitol as the main form of carbohydrate (~30 mg g
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’1</sup> dry weight) and greatly exceeded the levels of sucrose, fructose, and glucose and starch, while mannoheptulose levels remained low during the ripening process. This ripening process was accompanied by increases in C
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> sugars, while contents of perseitol and starch substantially decreased (
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). In fully ripe fruit, perseitol declined to levels below those of sucrose and hexoses (
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, after harvest and during ripening of avocado cv. Hass allowed to ripen at room temperature, 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blakey et al. (2012)</xref> reported a decline in the mesocarp content of mannoheptulose and perseitol in fruit from three different locations and increases and decreases for glucose, fructose and sucrose during ripening for the fruit from these three different locations. The increase of free glucose during avocado fruit ripening was associated to the high amounts of cellulose produced by avocado fruit during ripening possibly stimulating the synthesis of abscisic acid and ripening. The low correlations found between C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugar concentrations and respiration or total protein content were attributed to the fact that C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars are used in several cellular processes (
