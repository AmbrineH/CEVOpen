<p class="p">Regarding C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars transport in avocado trees, previous studies carried out with sap collected from the petioles of mature leaves and sap collected from girdled branches (

 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tesfay et al., 2012</xref>) appear to indicate that mannoheptulose and perseitol are the most important and major C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> mobile sugars in the tree and readily available for growth and development. Different studies suggest that mannoheptulose is a precursor of perseitol being perseitol conversion independent of photosynthesis (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cowan, 2004</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). From studies not only on avocado but also on other C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> containing species, 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cowan (2017)</xref> proposed a C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> biosynthesis pathway. C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars seem to arrive from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in photosynthetic organisms, and there is evidence supporting that sedoheptulose 7-P and mannoheptulose 7-P are precursors of sedoheptulose and mannoheptulose; however, the origin of the phosphorylated precursors is not known. The potential routes include transaldolase catalyzed condensation of dihydroxyacetone from D-fructose-6-P with the aldose D-erythrose-4-P to form sedoheptulose 7-P and then a transketolase catalyzed transfer of an Î±-hydroxy-acetyl from D-fructose-6-P to the aldopentose D-arabinose-5-P for mannoheptulose 7-P formation (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cowan, 2017</xref>). Thus, the proposed hypothesis states that C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars originate from fructose-6-P generated from hydrolysis of sucrose 
 <italic class="italic">via</italic> a transketolase-dependent-heptulose shunt. Relatively recently, 
 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> reported a complete transcriptome analysis of developing avocado fruit and found complete glycolytic pathways in cytosol and plastids being sucrose synthase and invertases highly expressed at different fruit developmental stages indicating that sucrose synthase besides being high abundant in the cytosol might be the major actor in the generation of hexoses necessary later for pyruvate synthesis. These authors also reported high expression of orthologs of transketolases and transaldolases in fruit mesocarp plastids suggesting also a possibility for their synthesis in the mesocarp. So possibly, sucrose synthase and invertases provide the supply of fructose for C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugar biosynthesis (
