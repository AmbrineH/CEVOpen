<p class="p">A very important group of organic acids present in avocados correspond to phenolic acids and fatty acids. Galacturonic acid, a very important component of pectins, will also be addressed in the section related to cell wall metabolism. However, 
 <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pedreschi et al. (2014)</xref> reported for Hass avocado at harvest, higher content of galacturonic acid in fast ripening fruit indicative of different physiological age. Phenolic acids do not participate in primary metabolism but mainly in secondary metabolism being precursors of other phenolic compounds and components of the cell wall. Thus, a very brief introduction to studies on the topic is incorporated in this review. 
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hurtado-Fernández et al. (2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015a)</xref> evaluated 13 different avocado cultivars including Hass at two different ripeness stages (at physiological maturity and ready to eat ripeness stages) and reported that the concentration of organic acids and phenolic acids generally decreased as the fruit ripened, except for phenolic acids such as ferulic and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-coumaric which increased in concentration as the fruit ripened. Hass avocado at harvest presented a lower amount of benzoic acid compared to the ready to eat stage. But, the quinic acid concentration in Hass was higher at harvest and decreased at the ready to eat stage (
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hurtado-Fernández et al., 2014</xref>). Lately, 
 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hurtado-Fernández et al. (2016)</xref> reported the evolution of six important metabolites from the phenyl-propanoid pathway including phenolic acids (pantothenic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acid) and epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, and abscisic in different avocado cultivars over different harvest seasons depending on the variety. Results showed that the phenolic acids previously mentioned were quite similar in the four avocado cultivars studied but the concentrations of chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and abscisic acid differed.
