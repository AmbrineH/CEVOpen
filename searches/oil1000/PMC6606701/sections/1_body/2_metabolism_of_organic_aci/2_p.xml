<p class="p">Not much work up to our knowledge has been reported regarding the most known organic acids evolution during growth, development, and ripening of 
 <italic class="italic">Persea americana</italic> possibly due to its high oil content that significantly contributes to fruit quality and taste instead of other fruit in which organic acids such as malate, citrate, tartaric, etc. play a significant role in fruit quality and taste. Avocado is classified as a non-acid fruit and compared to other fruit, and it contains very low amounts of citric and malic acid being the tartaric acid the predominant organic acid (

 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Defilippi et al. (2015)</xref> reported the organic acid profile of Hass avocado at harvest and during ripening at 20°C up to 15 days. Total acids (sum of tartaric, malic, citric and ascorbic) tended to decrease as ripening advanced and correlated to the decrease of titrable acidity during this period. This observed decrease was mainly governed by the drastic decrease of malic acid. Tartaric acid remained constant during this period and the contribution of ascorbic acid and citric acid was low and remained relatively constant during this period (

 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ahmed et al. (2010)</xref> reported for avocado cv. Fuerte, a mild decrease of titrable acidity during ripening as well as a mild but significant decrease of ascorbic acid during this period. In addition, 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arias et al. (2012)</xref> reported higher acidity of the seed than the peel and mesocarp in avocado cv. Hass from Algarve, but the acidity of the mesocarp was higher (0.04% citric acid) than the value reported for avocados cv. Hass from Mexico. At harvest, 
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuentealba et al. (2017)</xref> reported at the protein level differences in expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of organic acids such ATP dependent citrate synthase, cytosolic NAD malate dehydrogenase and for Hass avocado mesocarp displaying differences in ripening speed suggesting that the speed of ripening is dependent on primary metabolism. Citrate, isocitrate, and malate are intermediates of the Krebs cycle, thus changes in their content during growth, development and ripening are expected. Most of the Krebs cycle acids are stored in the vacuole (

 <xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mu et al., 2018</xref>); thus, the slight but significant decreases of total acids in avocado during ripening could be expected.
