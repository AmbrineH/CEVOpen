<p class="p">Regarding the second metabolic group of organic acids represented by ascorbic and tartaric acid, information regarding the evolution of ascorbic acid in Hass avocado mesocarp, exocarp, and seed is available. Ascorbic acid is located in all compartments of the cell. 
 <xref rid="ref122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tesfay et al. (2010)</xref> reported ascorbic acid contents for Hass avocado fruit from 16 weeks after full bloom (~70 g fresh weight) to commercial maturity (~180 g fresh weight, 18–22% oil content FW) lowest in the mesocarp and highest in the exocarp. During these 6 months of growth and development, avocado fruit displayed average contents of ascorbic acid of 0.41 mg g DW
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of mesocarp tissue, 2.77 mg ascorbic acid g DW
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of exocarp tissue, and 1.84 mg ascorbic acid g DW
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of seed. As fruit grew and developed, a decrease of ascorbic acid was observed for the mesocarp and seed but instead the exocarp displayed a mild increase of ascorbic acid during fruit growth and development. 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Defilippi et al. (2015)</xref> reported for Hass avocado subjected to ripening at 20°C during 15 days storage, that both tartaric acid and ascorbic acid remained relatively constant during this ripening period. The edible portion of Hass avocado has been reported to contain 8.8 mg ascorbic acid/100 g FW (
