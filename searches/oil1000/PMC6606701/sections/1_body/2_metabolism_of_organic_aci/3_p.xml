<p class="p">As stated by 
 <xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mu et al. (2018)</xref>, genetic regulation of organic acids not only is complex but involves several polygenes, and the fruit organic acid content is correlated with the activities of related enzymes. It has been reported for example that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADMDH), and NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) are important for the synthesis of malic acid and citric acid, but NADP-ME plays a major role in the degradation of malic acid (

 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2015)</xref> reported the transcriptome of the Mexican avocado and different organs (seeds, roots, stems, leaves, aerial buds, and flowers) and for three different fruit ripening stages defined as pre-climacteric, climacteric, and post-climacteric. A higher number of genes related to organic acid metabolic processes at the pre-climacteric stage followed by the climacteric and post-climacteric stages were reported by 
 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2015)</xref>. Annotated reported polygenes corresponded to malate dehydrogenase, peroxisomal NAD malate dehydrogenase, malate synthase, aluminum activated malate transporter 9, aconitase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase kinase, but their expression patterns at the three different stages previously mentioned are not available (

 <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilaru et al. (2015)</xref> reported as supplementary information the pattern expression of key genes related to organic acid metabolism in Hass avocado at five different developmental stages (from 75 g fruit and 4% oil to 200 g fruit and 12% oil). The gene annotated as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase family protein increased in expression from stage I and II but then tended to decrease in expression reaching its lowest level at stage V corresponding to mature fruit. Genes annotated as malate dehydrogenase cytosolic and plastidial did not present clear differences in expression at the five different developmental stages. As previously mentioned, avocado is considered as non-acid fruit and previous studies concluded that there is no correlation between the expression of organic acid metabolism related genes and organic acid content (
