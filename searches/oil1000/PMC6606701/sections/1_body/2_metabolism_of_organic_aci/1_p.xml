<p class="p">Organic acids in fruit can act as intermediate in diverse metabolic pathways, as precursors for the synthesis of amino acids, plant hormones, fatty acids, secondary metabolites, and cell wall components (
 <xref rid="ref132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Walker and Famiani, 2018</xref>). The most known organic acids malic, citric, isocitric, galacturonic, oxalic, and tartaric are quite abundant in some fruit, and the phenolic acids and ascorbic acid are present in all fruit. In fruit in general, most of the malate and citrate of the pulp is localized in the vacuole, and most of the organic acids present in the pulp are not imported but synthesized in the pulp from transported sugars (
