<p class="p">Avocado mesocarp contains a high content of 2% protein (
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dreher and Davenport, 2013</xref>). During “Hass” avocado fruit ripening, variations in the content of soluble proteins have been reported (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blakey et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blakey et al. (2012)</xref> reported increases of soluble protein content during ripening of Hass avocado from 17.8 mg g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> DW to 34.8 mg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> g DW from day 2 to day 16. This increase in soluble protein content is associated with the ripening process which demands 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> synthesis of enzymes/proteins involved in the different pathways triggered by the ripening process. Previously, 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blakey et al. (2010)</xref> reported similar increases in soluble protein content during ripening while C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars decreased while C
 <sub class="sub">6</sub> sugars tended to increase as ripening proceeded.
