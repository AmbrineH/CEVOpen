<p class="p">A thorough study on avocado fruit amino acid metabolism during growth, development, and ripening is not available up to our knowledge. The potential physiological role of polyamines involved in nucleic and protein synthesis in avocado was studied back in 1986 by Winer and Apelbaum. These authors studied the evolution of polyamines during avocado development and ripening. The levels of putrescine and spermidine decreased during fruit growth, being these decreases moderate during fruit development until maturation. However, the most striking decrease of these polyamines was observed during ripening (

Coincident with the climacteric peak of ethylene, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine decreased their contents to 0 and 20% of their initial values, respectively. Exogenous application of polyamines provoked a decrease in the level of endogenous ACC in avocado fruit. Interestingly, spermine in the mesocarp remained constant while the fruit was attached to the tree. From these findings, it was postulated that the high level of polyamines in avocado fruit during development provoke the repression of ethylene production and lack of ripening while the fruit remains attached to the tree (
