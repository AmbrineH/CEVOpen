<p class="p">Recent studies related to the understanding of differences in ripening speed of avocado fruit have demonstrated the participation of amino acid metabolism, protein folding, transport, and translation (

Glutamic acid has been reported to be highly correlated to a heat shock treatment (38Â°C for 1 h) that triggered ripening synchronization in early and middle season Hass avocado fruit. In the same study, differences 1 day after harvest, at the metabolome and proteome levels were observed between early and middle season fruit indicating differences in the physiological state at harvest and thus different response to the effectiveness of the heat treatment in terms of ripening (

 <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pedreschi et al. (2014)</xref> fast ripening Hass avocado fruit at harvest displayed higher contents of glutamic and aspartic acids and alanine compared to the slow ripening phenotype. These differences were attributed to differences in physiological maturity at harvest not evident with classical commercial assessment of dry matter content and firmness.
