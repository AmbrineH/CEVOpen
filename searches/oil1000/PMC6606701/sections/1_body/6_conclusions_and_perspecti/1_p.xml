<p class="p">A deep understanding of primary metabolism of avocado fruit during growth, development, and ripening and its relation to fruit quality is still to be achieved. Even though, the most recent studies have approached the understanding of this fruit species using new sequencing platforms and bioinformatic tools to critically study and deal with a non-model organism that lack a reference genome, still there is need for further studies that include a complete profiling of carbohydrates, lipids and hormones together with transcriptomic changes in mesocarp, peel, and seed. Further studies that incorporate stable isotope labeling approaches might be important to predict the flux of carbon in central metabolism in avocado. Thus, in depth understanding of avocado fruit development and carbon partitioning could be achieved. Amino acid and organic metabolism have been practically ignored in the studies reported. The role of C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars in early stages of mesocarp development and regulation of fruit ripening remains to be elucidated. In addition, the potential role of C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub> sugars and its coordination with the initiation of lipid biosynthesis remains to be studied. Regulation of oil biosynthesis in avocado mesocarp still deserves further studies, since fruit quality is determined in this fruit basically by the total oil content and composition of fatty acids. Cell wall metabolism has been poorly studied up to date in avocado and is crucial since it completely influences fruit firmness and other texture and sensory-related properties.
