 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lucas and Liu, 2017</xref>). Vessel occlusions develop in the conduit lumen in response to mechanical wounding in many species for wound sealing and reducing the risk of pathogen intrusion (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dute et al., 1999</xref>). Although xylem vessels are primarily dead cells at maturity, they are in contact and communication, especially via pits, with living perivascular parenchyma cells that surround vessels. Perivascular parenchyma cells are active in regulating xylem vessels contents. After wounding or fungal pathogen infection, heartwood substances accumulate in the perivascular parenchyma cells, and are released into the infected vessel lumen to format vessel occlusions for restricting the vessel ingress of the fungus (
