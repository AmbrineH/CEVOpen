<p class="p">Our field experiment showed that direct injection of ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into the stems of 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic> resulted in vessel occlusions and formation of “Jiang Xiang,” and it was observed that mechanical wounding induced the production of “Jiang Xiang” in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>. Ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> have been proposed to play vital roles in wound signaling, but little information is available on the roles of ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the wound-induced formation of vessel occlusions and biosynthesis of “Jiang Xiang” in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate whether ethylene or H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are involved in wounding-induced vessel occlusions and “Jiang Xiang” formation in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>.
