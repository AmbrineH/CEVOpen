<p class="p">It was concluded that mechanical wounding resulted in the synergistic biosynthesis of biphasic H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and ethylene, vessel occlusions and “Jiang Xiang” formation in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>. In this process, the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production stimulated higher biosynthesis of ethylene. Suppression of ethylene or H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> reduced the amount of vessel occlusions and “Jiang Xiang” production significantly. These results indicate that ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> play vital roles in vessel occlusions and formation of “Jiang Xiang” in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic> in response to mechanical wounding, and thus ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> could be applied to induce formation of “Jiang Xiang” in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>. Further study is needed to explore the molecular mechanism of ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> regulation on formation of “Jiang Xiang” in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>.
