<p class="p">Along the same pattern, ethylene production also burst twice in response to wounding. A similar pattern of wound-induced ethylene production was described in grape (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). Also, the hormone jasmonic acid was induced in a biphasic manner in response to wounding in pea seedlings (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). When wounding was conducted in air and in water, similar ethylene or H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was observed. It is understandable that treatments with ethylene or H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> inhibitors significantly inhibited ethylene or H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production in wounded stems, respectively. In contrast, it is intriguing thing that AsA, the special scavenger of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, also greatly inhibited ethylene production. This result indicated that the reduction in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> inhibited ethylene production induced by wounding. Meanwhile, wound-induced H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was not suppressed in the presence of AVG, a specific inhibitor for ethylene biosynthesis. In addition, the first H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> burst at 2 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) and a significant ethylene production peak at 6 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) were observed. Thereafter, the second H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> burst and another ethylene production peak occurred at 12 h and 18 h, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). These results suggest that mechanical wounding induced biphasic H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and ethylene production and each H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> burst was followed by an ethylene production peak. Hence, it appears that H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was required for ethylene production. Similar biphasic ROS or ethylene production was observed in plants subjected to other stresses such as ozone (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xie et al., 2011</xref>) and pathogen infection (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wi et al., 2012</xref>). After inoculation with 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, ethylene production in tobacco leaves followed a biphasic pattern reminiscent of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mur et al., 2008</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wi et al. (2012)</xref> further provided evidence that a pathogen-induced oxidative burst was required as an upstream regulator of ethylene production in both phases. They suggested that the rapid transient increases in ROS generation followed by ROS-induced ethylene production act as a determinant of a hypersensitive response, whereas the later massive ROS burst and subsequent massive ethylene production act as a positive determinant of pathogen expansion and cell death in compatible interactions. 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wi et al. (2012)</xref> also hypothesized that the late massive ROS burst stimulated higher biosynthesis of ethylene, which could promote disease susceptibility. In this process, the biphasic production of ethylene and ROS might be regulated by a self-amplifying loop (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wi et al., 2012</xref>). The issue of ROS signal specificity has recently received considerable attention. One possibility is that the specific features of ROS signaling could be perceived and decoded into specific responses, which determine gene expression patterns (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mittler et al., 2011</xref>). Despite these results, detailed studies on biphasic H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or ethylene production have not been performed.
