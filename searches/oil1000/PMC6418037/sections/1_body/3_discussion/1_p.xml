<p class="p">One of the prominent phenomena of plants in the response to external stimuli is the production pattern of ROS. Biphasic H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production with first a minor burst followed by a second major burst has been reported in several plants. In this study, there were two bursts of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic> stems after wounding, which was also observed in Arabidopsis and ryegrass (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> resulting in parenchyma cells necrosis. The medium H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration at 4 mm depth induced the most vessel occlusions and “Jiang Xiang.” This result was consistent with the fact that H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> plays a dual role in plants: it acts as a signal molecule at low concentrations and it leads to necrosis at high levels (
