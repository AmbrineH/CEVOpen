<p class="p">This study demonstrated that wound-induced ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> played vital roles in vessel occlusions and accumulation of “Jiang Xiang” in 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>. They might regulate vessel occlusions and formation of “Jiang Xiang” in pruned stems of 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>. Mechanical wound or fungal pathogen infection can induce structural barriers (including callose deposition, cell wall thickening and vessel occlusions), phytoalexins production, and induced expression of defense-related genes (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Daayf et al., 1997</xref>). It is hypothesized that pruning caused the production of wound signals (ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). In this process, the H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production stimulated higher biosynthesis of ethylene. Then synergistic biosynthesis of biphasic ethylene and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> resulted in the formation of structural barriers (vessel occlusions) and formation of phytoalexins (“Jiang Xiang”) that may contribute to physical barriers and chemical inhibition of microbes within vessels to prevent their spread. The PVO and amount of secondary substances increased with duration after pruning, and ultimately “Jiang Xiang” was formed in pruned stems of
