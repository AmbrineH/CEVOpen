<p class="p">Prior to pruning, the 
 <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic> stems had essentially no occlusions. After pruning in air, occlusions were observed in the vessel lumens, and continued production of vessel occlusions sealed some vessel lumens. A significant difference in vessel occlusions was observed between depths from the cut surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The percentage of vessels with occlusions (PVO) kept increasing in the first 4 weeks after pruning. After that, the changes were small. PVO increased much faster at 2, 4 and 6 mm compared to 8 and 10 mm, and PVO at 4 mm increased at a faster rate than other distances. Four weeks after pruning, the PVO at 2 and 4 mm sections reached 60.98 and 77.01%, respectively, while they were only 16.43 and 12.20% for 8 and 10 mm sections, respectively (
