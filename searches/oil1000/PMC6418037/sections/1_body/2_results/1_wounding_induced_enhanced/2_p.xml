<p class="p">In contrast, the pattern of ethylene production from the pruned end of stems treated with AVG or with AsA was dramatically different from the treatments in air and water. These two treatments almost eliminated the first rise in ethylene concentration; the second increase was greatly reduced too. The second peak value was 360.82 and 347.30 nL L
