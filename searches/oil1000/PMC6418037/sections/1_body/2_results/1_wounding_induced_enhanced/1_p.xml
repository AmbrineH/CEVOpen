<p class="p">Whether stems were pruned in air or in water, production of ethylene increased in response to wounding. Ethylene production increased in a biphasic manner with peaks at about 6 h and 18 h after pruning and an intervening decline to the initial level at 12 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The second peak was about 3-times greater than the first peak and 15-times greater than the initial concentration. By 30 h after pruning, the ethylene concentration was again at the initial level where it remained with a slight diurnal oscillation (
