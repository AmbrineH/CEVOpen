 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production between the treatments in air, water and AVG (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration at 12 h after pruning was 98.60, 96.75 and 97.68 nmol g

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was greatly suppressed in the presence of AsA, but not under the influence of AVG.
