<p class="p">Wound-induced H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was measured from 0 to 36 h after pruning at 5 depths from the wound surface. H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> also produced in a biphasic manner, peaked at about 2 h and 12 h after pruning and declined to the initial level at 6 h and 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The second peak of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production was about 2.5 times of the first peak and almost 40 times higher than the initial concentration. Generally, H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production decreased with distance from the wound surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The peak in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration at 12 h after pruning decreased with distance from the wounded surface, ranging from 98.60 nmol g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> FW at 2 mm to 29.65 nmol g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> FW at 10 mm (
