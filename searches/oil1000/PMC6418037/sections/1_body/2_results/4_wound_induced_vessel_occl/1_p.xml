<p class="p">In the stems pruned in air or water, occlusions were observed in a large number of vessels in secondary xylem (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6A,B</xref>), while occlusions were absent in most of the vessels in the stems treated with AVG or AsA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6C,D</xref>). The PVO and essential oil content were markedly affected by the AVG and AsA treatments. At 6 weeks after pruning, PVO at 4 mm section of stems treated in air, water, AVG or AsA reached 80.24, 76.92, 19.6 and 27.46%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7A</xref>). Consequently, the essential oil content was 0.45, 0.47, 0.13 and 0.18% for stems treated in air, water, AVG or AsA, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Figure 7B</xref>). These results indicated that suppression of wound-induced ethylene or H
