<p class="p">The kind and quantity of the volatiles in the treatment pruned in AVG or AsA also decreased significantly compared to the treatments pruned in air and water (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Similar volatiles were detected in the treatments pruned in air and water. Nine volatiles identified in wild “Jiang Xiang” was found in both treatments pruned in air and water and relative amounts of them were not statistically different. However, the volatiles of the treatment pruned in AVG or AsA were significantly different from the treatments in air and water. Only two and four volatiles were identified in stems pruned in AVG and AsA, respectively, which had fewer compounds than those in air and water (
