<p class="p">Sections were prepared from stems as described in section “Hydrogen Peroxide Assay”. For each sampling, five replicate stems were used for assessment of vessel occlusions with each treatment (a total of 140 stems). The samples were collected and fixed in formalin acetic acid-alcohol (FAA) for assessment of vessel occlusions at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks, respectively. The percentage of vessel occlusions (PVO) was assessed as previously described (

The sections were temporarily mounted with a cover slip in water, then observed under light microscopy (Olympus BX51, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (Pixera Pro 600ES, United States). Five areas, each containing 20–30 vessels, were chosen randomly for analysis. The analysis of each replication (cut stem) included 100–150 vessels.
