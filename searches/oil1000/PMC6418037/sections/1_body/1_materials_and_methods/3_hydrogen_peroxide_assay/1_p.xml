<p class="p">A 1.1-cm-thick stem was collected from the end of each treated stem. Then, a 1-mm-thick section at the end of the cut stem was abandoned, and five 2-mm-thick sections were collected at the positions of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm from the pruning end. Stem sections were taken at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h after pruning. They were transferred immediately on cutting to liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C for measurement of endogenous H
