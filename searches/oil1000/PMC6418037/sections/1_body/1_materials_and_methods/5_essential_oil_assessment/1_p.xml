<p class="p">The samples were collected as mentioned above for assessment of essential oil at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks, respectively. For each sampling, five replicate stems were used for assessment of essential oil with each treatment (a total of 140 stems). The samples were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder with a pestle and mortar. For each treatment, 1 g powdered stem samples were weighed, immersed in 30 ml petroleum ether and shaken for 24 h. After filtration and concentration (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, Germany), essential oil was obtained and the oil content was also calculated.</p>
