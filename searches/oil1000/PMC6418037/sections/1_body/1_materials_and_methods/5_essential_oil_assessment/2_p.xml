<p class="p">Essential oil from the 6 week harvest was used for GC-MS with an Agilent 6890 N-5975 I system with an Innowax DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Oven temperature was programmed to 70°C for 1 min, raised to 250°C at a rate of 8°C min
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, and kept constant at 250°C for 15 min. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV with the mass range
