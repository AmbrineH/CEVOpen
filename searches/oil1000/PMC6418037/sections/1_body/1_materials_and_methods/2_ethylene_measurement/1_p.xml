<p class="p">Ethylene production in pruned stems was estimated by measuring the ethylene evolved from the cut stem end. To collect gas evolved from the cut, a 5-cm-long rubber tube was attached immediately after each treatment and gas was collected in a 5-mL syringe. Each ethylene sample was collected for half an hour before measurement. The ethylene concentration in the accumulated gas in the syringe was measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h after treatment, respectively, using an analytical gas chromatograph (Shimazawa, Japan). Five replicate stems were used for the ethylene measurement with each treatment and ethylene production is reported as the concentration in the 5-mL headspace. Because of slight differences in the diameter among the shoots, ethylene concentration data were normalized to a shoot with a 2.64-cm diameter (approximate mean diameter).</p>
