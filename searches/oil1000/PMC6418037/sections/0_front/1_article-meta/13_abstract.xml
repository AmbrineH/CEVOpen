 <p class="p">The heartwood of 
  <italic class="italic">Dalbergia odorifera</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>), named “Jiang Xiang” in traditional Chinese medicine, is highly valuable. Mechanical wounding induced the production of “Jiang Xiang” in 
  <italic class="italic">D. odorifera.</italic> Ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>) are proposed to play vital roles in wound signaling. However, little is known about the role of ethylene or H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the wound-induced formation of vessel occlusions and biosynthesis of “Jiang Xiang” in 
  <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>. In this study, the pruning of 
  <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic> saplings resulted in the synergistic biosynthesis of biphasic ethylene and H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which was followed by formation of vessel occlusions and “Jiang Xiang” in the pruned stems. In this process, the H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> production stimulated higher biosynthesis of ethylene. Treatments with aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), an inhibitor for ethylene biosynthesis and ascorbate acid (AsA), a scavenger of H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, markedly reduced the production of ethylene and H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, respectively, and the corresponding the percentage of vessels with occlusions (PVO), oil content, and the amount of “Jiang Xiang” formed. These results indicate that ethylene and H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> might be important wound signals in 
  <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic> that induce vessel occlusions and formation of “Jiang Xiang,” and thus ethylene and H
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> might play vital roles in “Jiang Xiang” formation in pruned stems of 
  <italic class="italic">D. odorifera</italic>.
