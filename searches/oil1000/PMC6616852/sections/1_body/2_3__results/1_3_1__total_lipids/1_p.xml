<p class="p">Total lipids ranged from 2.97% to 3.54% d.b. in the year 2010 and from 3.10% to 3.50% d.b. in the year 2011, and the average value was 3.22% d.b. considering both years together (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00223-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The moisture content of grains ranged between 10.5% and 12.3% and the average was 11.4% (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00223-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Total lipid content was strongly dependent on the combination of cultivar (cv)/growing site (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and to a minor extent on the growing year (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas the interaction cv/site × year was not a statistically significant factor of variation. In any case, differences were very small: up to 0.57 between samples of different cultivars and up to 0.18 between years for samples of a same cv/site (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00223-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Differences between years for samples of the same cv/site were not significant. The total lipid values found in this study are in line with those reported by the USDA National Nutrient Database (2.8 g/100 g d.b. for product N. 20076 “wheat, durum”, mean of 18 samples, standard error 0.060) and by the Italian food composition tables (3.3 g/100 g d.b. for “durum wheat”) compiled by the Italian National Institute for Research on Food and Nutrition (INRAN) [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. If we take into account the geographical separation into Central and Southern Italy, we can say that the average total lipid values for all samples were 3.24% and 3.21% d.b. respectively, whereas the range of values was 2.97–3.54% for Central Italy and 3.09–3.41% d.b. for Southern Italy.
