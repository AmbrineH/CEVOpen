<p class="p">Durum wheat in Italy is grown under rain-fed production: it is planted in late autumn or early winter and harvested in early summer, which often leads to limited rainfall and high temperatures, resulting in water stress during grain filling. Crop rotation and balanced nutrient management (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, pre-sowing and topdressing fertilization) are practiced to ensure that the crop produces the greatest possible high-quality yield with the moisture that is available. The main climate factors influencing durum wheat crop quality are rainfall and temperature during the growing season. Data on these two factors of the years 2009â€“2011 in Central and Southern Italy can be found in the reports by the Italian High Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA,) [
