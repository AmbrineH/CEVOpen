<p class="p">All the reported differences can be explained by the differences in genetic characteristics, pedoclimatic conditions, agronomical treatments and analytical procedure, as stated in the Introduction. In particular, Beleggia et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] identified the interaction genotype × year × treatment as the main contributor to the variability of the fatty acid levels observed in 24 durum wheat samples, especially for linoleic, oleic and stearic acids. Armanino et al. [

The variation in saturated and unsaturated fatty acids within the same variety is also associated with various kinds of biotic and abiotic stresses, like low or high temperature, salt, drought, pathogens and others [
