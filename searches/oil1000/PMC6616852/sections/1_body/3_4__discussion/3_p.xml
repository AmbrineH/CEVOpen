<p class="p">Actually, the USDA database (but not the INRAN one) and other works also report small amounts of C14:0 in durum wheat kernels (USDA 0.003 g/100 g fresh matter, corresponding to 0.0035 g/100 g d.b.). We did not detect this acid, as it was at the limit of detection of our method. There are publications reporting other fatty acids as well (i.e., C17, C20, C22 and C24), some in kernels (Beleggia et al. [
