 <xref rid="B11-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], we can briefly say that in both areas of Italy (Central and South), temperatures were similar in the first part of the two growing seasons (October–December 2009 and 2010), except the month of December which was warmer in 2009 than in 2010. In the second part of the growing season (January–June, particularly April–June), the Central area showed warmer temperatures in 2011 than in 2010. In regard to precipitation, the first growing season (2009) started with a lesser amount of rain in October–December with respect to the second one (2010) and continued with a higher amount of rain in the January–June period. This happened both in Central and Southern Italy.
