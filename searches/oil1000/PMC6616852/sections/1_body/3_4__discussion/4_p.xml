However, the range of the detected values contained the reference values, except for C16:0 and for total saturated acids, for which the detected range extended entirely below the USDA and INRAN means. Neither database reports the standard deviations for fatty acids in durum wheat and only the USDA one reports sample numerosity (that is, 29); in this latter case, a certain width around the reported value can be supposed, but it is not quantified. On the contrary, for the unsaturated/saturated ratio, the range of the detected values extends entirely above the mean reported by USDA and contains that reported by INRAN. As a matter of fact, there are notable differences between the two references used. The INRAN values are equal to or higher than the USDA values for the considered variables, in particular for C18:0 (+50%), C18:2 (+31%), C18:3 (+120%), total polyunsaturated acids (+34%) and unsaturated/saturated ratio (+17%).
