<p class="p">Lipid content, lipid classes and fatty acid levels in wheat kernels depend on a set of factors, some of which are genetic, such as species and variety [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], whereas others depend on the environment and are related to pedoclimatic conditions, agronomic practices and maturity level [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. For example, durum wheat and hard red wheat generally have a higher lipid content than soft white wheat and the levels of fatty acids are different in durum and in soft wheat. In regard to climatic conditions, it has been seen that cold weather favors an increase of lipid content in wheat and a higher degree of unsaturation in fatty acids due to the need for membrane fluidification [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Other kinds of biotic and abiotic stresses can influence the level of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in plants [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Moreover, different extraction and analytical methods can also account for the differences found in the literature [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Notwithstanding the number of samples analyzed, we can assume that data about fatty acid levels in durum wheat are abundant in the literature, but it is difficult to have a clear idea of their content and to make comparisons for a number of reasons: (i) different authors report fatty acids as percentage, alternatively referring to: (1) total lipids, (2) total fatty acids, or (3) kernel weight (in addition, some authors analyze germ oil and others analyze whole kernels); (ii) authors interested in statistic elaborations (e.g., in order to investigate variation factors or to look for discriminating parameters) often report charts and graphs rather than tables of data; (iii) cultivars are different in different countries and new ones are constantly bred; and (iv) databases do not always report the sample numerosity and the standard variation of the means.
