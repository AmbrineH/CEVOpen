<p class="p">In this work, the content and level of variation in lipids and of their fatty acids in the durum wheat kernels commercially grown in Italy (where durum wheat is an important cereal crop mainly used for pasta manufacturing) were assessed. For this reason, we selected 10 cultivars amongst the most commonly grown for pasta making. Samples were collected in several locations of Central and Southern Italy to account, at least partially, for differences due to different pedoclimatic environments; Southern Italy is characterized by milder winters and warmer springs and summers with respect to Central Italy, however both areas are considered highly suitable for durum wheat cultivation. Moreover, crops from two consecutive years were collected from the same fields.</p>
