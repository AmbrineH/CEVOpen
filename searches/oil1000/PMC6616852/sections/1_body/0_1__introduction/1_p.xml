<p class="p">Durum wheat (

 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Roughly two thirds (66%) of them are contained in the germ, 15% are in the bran (particularly in the aleuronic layer), and about 20% are distributed in the endosperm, partly within the starch granules. From a chemical point of view, the most abundant fraction is composed by nonpolar lipids, which are mainly storage acylglycerols. Phospholipids, glycolipids and other classes are present in lesser amounts. The fatty acids of wheat lipids are mostly unsaturated (C18:2, C18:1, C18:3 and C16:1) and two of them are essential (linoleic and linolenic). This increases the value of wheat lipids for human nutrition, because essential fatty acids are precursors of important classes of biomolecules in the human body (like prostaglandins and membrane phospholipids) and are involved in metabolic processes like regulation of blood lipid levels, particularly cholesterol [
