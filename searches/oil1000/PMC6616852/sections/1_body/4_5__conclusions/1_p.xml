<p class="p">This work contributes to the knowledge on the content and variability of total fats and of the main fatty acids in durum wheat kernels. The values obtained in this study are also compared with reference values from national and international databases. In this paper, the use of standard methods of analysis, statistical data (numerosity of samples, mean, standard errors) and the specification of all the elements that allow for conversion of results into different units of measure (g/100 g dry or wet sample, g/100 g fat matter) make this data very useful in the compilation of databases and easy to compare with other data. Moreover, updated data on lipids are needed to set proper quality standards for products such as wheat wholegrain flours and foods where the presence of germ is desirable.</p>
