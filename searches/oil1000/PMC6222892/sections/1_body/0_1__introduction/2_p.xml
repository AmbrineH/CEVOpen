<p class="p">Not only does the diversity of biomolecules in flaxseed give this plant crop a high nutritional profile, but also, some of the flaxseed components have been explored as food additives due to certain functional properties they exhibit. Functional properties are those traits used to describe how the biochemical component of foods affects the sensorial properties of food during and after processing. For example, flaxseed mucilage has a high water-binding capacity [
