<p class="p">While flaxseed is one of the oldest oil crops used for food, information on the processing of its functional ingredients can vary. Moreover, many of the processing techniques developed for other oil crops are often not suitable for use on flaxseed. In this review, the functional/bioactive ingredients derived from flaxseed are described, while further elaborating on the processing techniques used for extraction or isolation of these ingredients. The potential challenges to the extraction of flaxseed-derived functional ingredients are raised, and ideas on potential avenues for more efficient, greener, extraction are also discussed. This review also highlights and discusses the strategies for the detoxification of flaxseed. </p>
