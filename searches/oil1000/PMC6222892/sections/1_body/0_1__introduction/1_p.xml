<p class="p">The common flax (or linseed, 
 <italic class="italic">Linum usitatissimum</italic>), is an important agricultural commodity worldwide. It is considered a ‘superfood’ and generally recognized as safe (GRAS) source of vitamins, minerals, proteins and peptides (including bioactive cyclic peptides), lipids (including omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids), carbohydrates, lignans and dietary fibre [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02444-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> for the composition of flaxseed). The health preventive and bioactive properties of these flaxseed components have been well studied. For example, the lipids, lignans, and fibre in flaxseed have been shown to have hypolipidemic, antiatherogenic, postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses, anticholesterolemic and anti-inflammatory properties [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Moreover, other flaxseed components such as the proteins and peptides have been shown to induce certain desirable biologically active properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, immune suppression/enhancement, glucose absorption control, etc. in living body systems [

It is therefore no wonder that flaxseed is included in many recipes in modern health foods culinary literature, especially after the publication of the outcome of the FlaxPAD clinical trials that studied “the effect of dietary flaxseed on improving symptoms of cardiovascular disease in patients with peripheral arterial disease” [
