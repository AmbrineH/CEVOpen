<p class="p">However, despite their food and health applications, flaxseed contains high levels of phytotoxic compounds, the consumption of which can lead to poorly bioavailable nutrients and/or health complications. The major antinutritive compounds in flaxseed are linatine, phytic acids, protease inhibitors and cyanogenic glycosides (linustatin, neolinustatin, linamarin and lotaustralin). Phytic acid interferes with the absorption of minerals such as calcium, zinc, magnesium, copper and iron [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], whereas, upon hydrolysis, cyanogenic glycosides release hydrogen cyanide, a respiratory inhibitor which in turn is converted to thiocyanates. Thiocyanates impede iodine uptake by thyroid gland and long term exposure exacerbates iodine-deficiency disorders such as goiter and cretinism [
