<p class="p">Solvent extraction method is one of the traditional means of removing cyanogens in flaxseeds. A two-phase solvent extraction system comprising alkanol-ammonia-water/hexane has been demonstrated in the extraction of oil and detoxification of flaxseed meals [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. An optimum composition of an alkanol-ammonia-water system for detoxification of flaxseeds was obtained by using 95% methanol, 10% ammonia, 10â€“15% water [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. The aforementioned composition resulted in a cyanogen detoxification yield of about 56% in the first run of extraction, 80% in the second run and over 90% in the third run. Similarly, Varga et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] used a two-phase solvent system consisting of 0.08% NaOH, 10% water, 90% methanol to extract about 83.6% cyanogens present in flaxseeds. However, the challenge with solvent extraction is the inability to completely detoxify flaxseeds of the cyanogens, and concomitantly reducing the protein, fibre, fat, and lignin content [
