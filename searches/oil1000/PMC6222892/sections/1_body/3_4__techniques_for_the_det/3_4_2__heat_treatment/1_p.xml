 <xref rid="B102-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. High thermal treatment, above 120 °C, have also been shown to be less efficient resulting in the retention of a substantial amount of the cyanogens in the flaxseed [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. This is as a result of the inactivation of endogenous β-glucosidases which have the ability to degrade indigenous cyanogens. An alternative approach proposed by Yamashita et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] involves pulverising flaxseeds into a powder which can then be incubated at about 30 °C and an optimised time to completely degrade the cyanogens to release hydrogen cyanides. Hydrogen cyanides released into the slurry were then steam evaporated to yield a cyanide-free dry flaxseed meal without adversely affecting the protein, fibre, fat, and lignin.
