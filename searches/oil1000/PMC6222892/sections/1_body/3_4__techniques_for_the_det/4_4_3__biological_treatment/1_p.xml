<p class="p">The use of a biological approach in the degradation of hydrogen cyanide is a relatively cheaper approach in food processing. Commercial enzymes such as linamarase, xylanase, and cellulase have been successfully demonstrated in the degradation of cyanogenic glucosides in cassava and cassava-based food products to acceptable limits [

 <xref rid="B99-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] observed that flaxseeds had a low substrate specificity after experimenting on similar commercial enzymes linamarase from

 <italic class="italic">Prunus dulcis</italic> which yielded low activity. Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>] utilised a response surface methodology to optimise a fermentation process to detoxify flaxseeds of cyanogenic glucosides. The optimised fermentation process involved the use of 12.5% β-glucosidase and 8.9% cyanide hydratase enzymes to reduce cyanide concentration in flaxseed powder from 1.156 to 0.015 mg after 48 h.
