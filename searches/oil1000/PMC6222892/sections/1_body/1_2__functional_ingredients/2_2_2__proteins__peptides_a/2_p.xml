<p class="p">The digestibility of flaxseed proteins is dependent on whether the protein is isolated in pure form or if it exists together with other nutritional components (mucilage, oils, etc.). Extracts of proteins are highly digestible (coefficient of digestibility value of 89.6%). Processing of flaxseed to remove oil and mucilage, thereby concentrating the proteins improved the in vitro digestibility of the proteins [
