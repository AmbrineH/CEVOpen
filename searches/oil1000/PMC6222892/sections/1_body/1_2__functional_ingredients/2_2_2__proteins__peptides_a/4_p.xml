<p class="p">Flaxseed is also one of the sources of cyclic peptides called cyclolinopeptides, and to date over 25 different kinds of these peptides have been identified in flaxseed. For example, the bioactive peptide cyclolinopeptide A (cyclo-(Pro-Pro-Phe-Phe-Leu-Ile-Ile-Leu-Val) and derivatives thereof has been shown to have antimalarial activity [
