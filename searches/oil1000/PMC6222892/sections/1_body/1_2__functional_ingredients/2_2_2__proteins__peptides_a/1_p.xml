Also, Flaxseed is not a complete source of dietary protein (due to its deficiency in certain essential amino acids like lysine), but nevertheless, the contributions that these beneficial proteins and bioactive compounds (mainly peptides) have, as well as their potential nutraceutical/nutritional applications have received huge attention in literature.
