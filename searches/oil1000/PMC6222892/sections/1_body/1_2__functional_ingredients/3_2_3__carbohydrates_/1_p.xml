<p class="p">There is a lack of consensus in nutrition research on the levels of carbohydrate in flaxseed as well as whether this group of functional components significantly contribute to overall physiological nourishment through dietary consumption. Although flax as an entity is quite low in carbohydrates or sugars/starches (~1%) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], the carbohydrate component of flaxseed has been reported to be ~29% [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. This may be the reason why flaxseed is not considered to be an important source of food carbohydrates. Roughly, there are two major components of flaxseed polysaccharides: rhamnogalactouran and arabinoxylan. Rhamnogalactouran is an acidic polysaccharide, consists of L-fucose acid, L-rhamnose, D-galactouronic acid and 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galactose, and makes up about ~25% of flaxseed polysaccharides. Arabinoxylan, on the other hand is neutral, consists of arabinose, galactose and xylose, and makes up 75% of flaxseed polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. It is worth noting that there is a significant difference of opinion regarding the productivity, exact constitution of monosaccharide components, and quality assessment of these polysaccharides [
