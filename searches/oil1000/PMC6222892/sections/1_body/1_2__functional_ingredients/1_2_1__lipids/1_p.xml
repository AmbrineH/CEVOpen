<p class="p">Lipids are one of the high value functional ingredients in flaxseeds. Out of all the lipids available in flaxseed, the major component is the α-linoleic acid (~53%), followed by oleic acid (~19%), linoleic acid (~17%), palmitic acid (~5%) and stearic acid (~3%) [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The oil extracted from flaxseed contains a very high proportion of both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (~91%), and minor amounts of saturated fatty acids (~9%). The high levels of unsaturated fatty acids is partly the reason why flaxseeds are considered to be a major health promoting agent [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In fact, for vegetarians, flaxseeds are the principal source of omega 3 fatty acids. Consequently, products containing flaxseed and its derivatives have been proposed as nourishing supplements for a range of dietary entities (see [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and references therein). Several clinical studies have reported the extraordinary health benefits of alpha-linoleic acids [

This single constituent has been shown to control the development of atherosclerosis (mainly due to its constituents: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and decosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, and asthma [

Additionally, significant lowering of low density lipoproteins (LDL, so called bad cholesterol) without noticeable changes in high density lipoproteins (HDL, or good cholesterol) has been linked to flaxseed consumption, in addition to nullification of lipid peroxidation [
