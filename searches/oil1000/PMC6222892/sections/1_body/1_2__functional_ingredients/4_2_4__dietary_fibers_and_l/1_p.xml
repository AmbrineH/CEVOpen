<p class="p">Dietary fibers and phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, and lignans) constitute a significant fraction of the flaxseed composition. A detailed discussion of the metabolism, composition and health properties of these components is available elsewhere [

Soluble flax mucilage finds frequent use as a food constituent, either as vegetable and fruit juice stabilizers, or as an ingredient for preventing syneresis and improving the texture of dairy products [
