<p class="p">Little work has been done on the use of subcritical and supercritical fluid extraction of flaxseed polysaccharides. There is, however, an extensive body of work on the extraction of carbohydrates in bioprocessing. Carbohydrates are CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-philic compounds [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. While supercritical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) allows for the selective extraction of carbohydrates, organic modifiers need to be introduced which is not ideal when extracting bioactive carbohydrates [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. However, the process is renewable and so using scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is both a ‘greener’ and sustainable approach.
