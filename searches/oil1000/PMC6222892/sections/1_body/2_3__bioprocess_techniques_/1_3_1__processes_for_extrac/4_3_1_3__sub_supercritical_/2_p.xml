<p class="p">Subcritical fluid extraction is an adaption of PL, where the solvent utilised is water. With increased pressure and heat, water becomes less polar. The resultant process allows for the selective extraction of carbohydrates based on its solubility under different polarities of water [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. This process doesnâ€™t require the introduction of modifiers like scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or organic solvents (as in the case of like traditional PL) and is therefore more suitable for food grade extracts of bioactive carbohydrates. Additionally, as subcritical fluid extraction has a greater range of polarities when compared to scCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, this method has potential for greater selectivity [
