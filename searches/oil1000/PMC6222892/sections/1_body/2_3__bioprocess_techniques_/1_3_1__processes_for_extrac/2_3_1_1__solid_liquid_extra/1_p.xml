<p class="p">Solid-liquid extraction is the simplest technique for isolating bioactive carbohydrates and involves the mass transfer of solutes from a solid matrix into a solvent. Water is the primary solvent used in the extraction of carbohydrates [

The resulting viscous crude extract is then precipitated using organic solvents or ultrafiltration with subsequent freeze drying. Whole seed extraction yields around 8% (

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. This yield can be further improved through milling of seed cake, however, the increased surface area exacerbates the uncontrolled release of proteins which is difficult to separate from the highly viscous mucilage and represents a serious issue for cost-effective commercial upscaling [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Activated charcoal and ion-exchange chromatography are the most utilised methods for the selective removal of carbohydrates from crude fractions, but these techniques are time consuming as one often needs several washing steps. Moreover, depending on the solvents used, removal of residues may also need to be undertaken. Solid-liquid extraction has the advantage of giving reasonable yields with little capital costs. The major disadvantage in using these methods is the laborious process of purification and slow mass transfer rate. Particularly when extracting carbohydrates from flaxseed, strategies such as increasing the surface area become a hindrance to extraction. Furthermore, the fact that organic solvents are routinely used to precipitate the mucilage, limits the use of this approach, especially when the aim is to reduce toxicity as the options of safe, cheap ‘green’ solvents are limited.
