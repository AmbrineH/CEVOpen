<p class="p">Based on the principles of Soxhlet, pressurised liquid (PL) extraction uses organic solvents for the rapid mass transfer of compounds from a solid matrix into the solvent [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The rapid mass transfer of PL resolves the issues of conventional solid-liquid extraction. Ignoring the capital cost of implication, the disadvantages with using PL for the selective removal of bioactive carbohydrates are similar to that of conventional solid-liquid extraction.
