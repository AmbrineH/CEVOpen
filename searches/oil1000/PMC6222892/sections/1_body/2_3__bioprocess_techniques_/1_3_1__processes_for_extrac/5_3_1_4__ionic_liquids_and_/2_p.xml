 <xref rid="B57-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. NADES are not only safer than IL but also cheaper. However, more investigation is needed to better identify and understand the toxicity of extracts prepared with NADES for human consumption. Moreover, the use of IL or NADES for the extraction of flaxseed components is almost non-existent. These represent the bottleneck to the commercial implementation of IL and NADES in this area [
