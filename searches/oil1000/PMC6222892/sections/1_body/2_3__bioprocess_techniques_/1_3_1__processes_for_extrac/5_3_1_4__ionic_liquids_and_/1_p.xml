<p class="p">Ionic liquids (IL) and natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) represent an alternative to the use of water as a primary solvent in carbohydrate extraction and a replacement for traditional organic solvents [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Unlike other processes, the use of IL and NADES are a cost-effective alternative that is relatively non-toxic and easy to prepare [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. IL are mixtures of organic salts that have low melting points and an immiscible vapour pressure. IL can be used to dissolve a range of carbohydrates from monosaccharides to polysaccharides. Adding small amounts of water to an IL allows for modification of the polarity and solubility of the solvent and target analyte. Choline chloride ILs produce the most effective preparation for the extraction of complex carbohydrates such as cellulose [
