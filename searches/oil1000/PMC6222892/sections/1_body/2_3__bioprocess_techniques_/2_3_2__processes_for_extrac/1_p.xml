<p class="p">Many fractionation techniques have been used over several decades for separation of seed protein of which flaxseed is no exception. Flaxseed proteins fall into three classes: albumin, globulin and glutelin [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Before their implementation as food component, protein must be extracted from seeds in order to enhance their digestibility, improve techno-functional properties as well as taste and colour, and reduce levels of antinutritive compounds [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Various protein extraction techniques have been proposed for the preparation of protein isolates from flaxseed. These include conventional approaches and novel processing technologies. The conventional isolation method includes alkaline/isoelectric precipitation, acid pre-treatment with ultrafiltration, and micellization technique (ammonium sulfate precipitation). Several novel technologies have also been discovered for protein extraction. These methods increases the yield, functionality and production sustainability of protein [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Novel technologies include ultrasound assisted extraction, electro-activation technique, pressurized low polarity water extraction, pulseâ€“electric field technique, high voltage electrical discharge and complete or limited enzymatic (proteases) hydrolysis-assisted extraction. Before the application of the above-mentioned techniques, extraction of mucilage, gum removal, defatting and milling of flaxseed are employed to facilitate the protein recovery from the raw materials [
