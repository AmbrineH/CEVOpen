<p class="p">This approach involves pre-treatment of flaxseed with acid followed by ultrafiltration [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Here, defatted flaxseed flour is suspended in water, adjusted and washed to pH 4.5 using mineral acids under mild agitation, and incubated for a time at room temperature. Acid extract and residue are separated through centrifugation of the protein slurry. The process is repeated several times on the residue to obtain more protein extracts which are later combined and filtered (ultrafiltration or diafiltration) to obtain retentate and permeate. The retentate is then sprayâ€“dried to obtain flaxseed protein.
