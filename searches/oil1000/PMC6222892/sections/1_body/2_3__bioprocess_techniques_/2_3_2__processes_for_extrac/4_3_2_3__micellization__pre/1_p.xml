 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Protein precipitate by ‘salting out’ at different salt concentrations. The most commonly used salt is ammonium sulfate, due to its high solubility, minimal cost and lack of buffering capacity relative to other salts [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Micellization involves protein extraction with salt solution, usually in an ice bucket, followed by removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, recovery of precipitates by centrifugation, diafiltration to remove excess salts and final recovery by centrifugation [

 <xref rid="B66-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Proteins extracted by micellization have low phytic acid and pentosans levels, higher enthalpies (meaning high structural order), and are lightly coloured [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. However, ammonium sulphate precipitation can be onerous [
