<p class="p">Isoelectric precipitation is the most prevalently used approach for protein recovery and involves manipulating the pH of the protein solution to reach the solute pI that achieves precipitating of the proteins. With this extraction process, defatted flaxseed is suspended in water (usually at 1:10 or 20 
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic> ratio), followed by alkaline extraction at high pH (pH 9–10 adjusted with base) and stirred for a few hour at a specified temperature (usually 37–40 °C) to extract proteins [

The residue is subjected to one more protein extraction step, followed by centrifugation and recovery as described above. The extracts are combined and adjusted to a low pH (usually 4.5–5) with acid at room temperature to precipitate the flaxseed proteins. The recovered protein precipitate is collected by centrifugation, and suspended in distilled water, after which the pH is adjusted to neutral. Furthermore, the protein solution can be lyophilized after dialysis to remove small molecules such as salt.
