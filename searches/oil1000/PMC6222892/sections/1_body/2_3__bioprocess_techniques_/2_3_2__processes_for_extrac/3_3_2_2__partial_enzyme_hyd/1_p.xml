<p class="p">With this approach, flaxseed meal is treated with proteases such as papain, trypsin, pancreatic, alcalase, pronase, ficin, unanizyme and flavouryme. Enzymatic hydrolysis of defatted and demucilaged flaxseed is initially adjusted to the pH optimal of the enzyme (e.g., alcalase (8.0), trypsin and pancreatin (7.5), flavouryme (7) and papain (6.5)) under mixing. The mixture is then incubated with one or a cocktail of enzymes where these proteases function to break the peptide linkage between adjacent amino acids and/or protein-carbohydrate molecules. The reaction mixture is stopped after several hours and protease is inactived by heating and rapid cooling. The suspension (mixture) is subjected to sonication, and the solubilized protein obtained by centrifugation and lyophilisation [

However, the use of enzymes can add to the overall cost of the processing method. Moreover, extensive hydrolysis of the proteins must be avoided. Thus, partial hydrolysis appear to be more beneficial in improving protein functionality than complete proteolysis, which can greatly impair protein functionality.
