<p class="p">Cold press is a gentle mechanical oil extraction by which oil is forcibly pressed from seed through the application of pressure and shear force using screw press or oil expeller [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Prior to pressing, flaxseed is flaked, extruded and conditioned to remove all foreign material (dust, stone, immature seeds, etc.) to maximize operating capacity and oil recovery [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The cleaned and dried linseed is poured into an oil expeller or mechanical screw press with a rotating screw. During the operation of the screw press, the resolving screw forces the oil seed through a cylindrical enclosure, thus lessen the space occupied by the seeds, this leads to the expression of oil leaving behind the cake [
