<p class="p">Different solvents are used for extraction of oil from oilseeds including flaxseeds. These solvents include acetone, methanol, petroleum ether, n-hexane dichloromethane, ethanol and heptane. Solvent extraction depends on factors such as nature of solvent, reaction time, temperature and solid/solvent ratio. With solvent extraction, cleaned, ground flaxseed is placed in a solvent in solid-to-solvent ratio of around 1:10 (
