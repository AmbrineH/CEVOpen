<p class="p">A novel technique that utilizes aqueous solvents (called aqueous extraction based on nitrogen protection) has also been trialled [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. This process involves the use of salts solution to aid the separation of oils from aqueous mixtures by changing surface tension of the water phase as well as surface charges of components such as proteins and oils. This leads to a reduction in the number and stability of emulsions thereby enhancing oil extraction [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Salt-aided aqueous extraction is relatively low cost, and leads to maximum quantity and good quality of oil with enhanced stability against oxidation [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. This method has been used to obtain high yield (86.4%) of transparent and clear oil from flaxseed [
