<p class="p">Microwave and ultrasonic assisted extraction are two techniques used to improve oil extraction kinetics and efficiency [

 <xref rid="B71-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. These techniques improve oil extraction efficiency, by making it easier for solvents to penetrate into seed and increase contact surface between solvent and seed materials [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. With these approaches, ground flaxseed is initially mixed with solvent followed by insertion of the ultrasonic probe into the mixture or placing the mixture in a microwave chamber. The oil sample is extracted under continuous ultrasonic/microwave energy and variant level of power output [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. The advantages of microwave- and ultrasonic-assisted extraction include shorter extraction times, reduced solvent consumption and thermal damage to extracts, reduction in loss of bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], as well as enhanced yield and economy [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. On the contrary, it still involves the use of organic solvents which could be hazardous [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The ability of ultrasound and microwave to improve extraction of flaxseed oil has been studied and reported [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. Long et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] obtained about 68% oil recovery by coupling ultrasound treatment with immobilized enzyme cocktail consisting of cellulose, pectinase and hemicellulose. The oil obtained with this treatment had higher antioxidant properties and higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids when compared with oil obtained from organic solvent (hexane) extraction alone. Also, Ren et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-23-02444" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] obtained an extraction yield of 78.11% through pre-treatment of flaxseed with microwave energy, and the pre-treatment step had no effect on the fatty acid profile of oil extracted.
