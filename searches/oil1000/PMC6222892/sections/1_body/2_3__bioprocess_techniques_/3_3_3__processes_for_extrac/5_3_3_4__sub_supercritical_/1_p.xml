<p class="p">Sub/supercritical fluid (SFE) extraction processes have gained growing attention as industrial scale techniques in the recovery of edible oils from seeds such as canola, corn, sunflower, sorghum and flaxseed. This technique overcomes the shortcomings of solvent extraction since a gas at supercritical condition, rather than an organic solvent, is used in the extraction process. Some gasses used in supercritical fluid extraction include carbon dioxide, propane, toluene and ethane. Among these gases, carbon dioxide is the most commonly used due to its acceptable critical condition parameters, non-flammability, low cost, high selectivity and non-toxicity [
