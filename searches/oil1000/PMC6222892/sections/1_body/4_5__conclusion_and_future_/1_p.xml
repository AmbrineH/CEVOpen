<p class="p">Flaxseed is a nutrient-and functional food ingredient-rich crop owing to the high levels of vitamins, minerals, proteins, lipids, dietary fibre and lignans. The food and nutritional applications of flaxseed will continue to attract the attention of health-conscious consumers and food manufacturers alike. In this regard, obtaining high value ingredients/component through bio-refinery of flaxseed (where various nutrients and functional ingredients are extracted from seeds along the process chain) or through valorisation of by-products (example extraction of proteins and fibre/mucilage from flaxseed cake derived from oil extraction processes) is very attractive. However, to explore the full potential of this ‘super food’, further research is needed specifically in the design of industrially and economically feasible, food-grade, ‘green’ approaches for the extraction and purification of the many functional food ingredients obtainable from flaxseed. The suitability of extraction procedure and isolation techniques depend on the type of the nutrient, the scale of isolation, and commercialization feasibility, amongst others. It must be noted that no technique is perfect and each method has its own intrinsic benefits and disadvantages. For isolation of carbohydrates from flaxseeds, solid-liquid extraction may be adopted for reasonably high yields and low costs. However, super/subcritical fluid extraction strategies have garnered considerable attention of late due to their assorted range of benefits such as renewability and sustainability, varied range of polarities, higher selectivity, which are all suitable for derivation of food-quality extracts. For extraction of proteins from flaxseeds, both conventional and novel strategies have been tried. In spite of certain demerits, isoelectric precipitation is still the most prevalent traditional method for protein isolation, mainly because of the associated high yield. Novel techniques such as ultrasound-assisted extraction, electro-activation and pressurized low-polarity water extraction also hold promise, but these have to be optimized to improve their performance and overcome the associated high maintenance costs. For lipid extraction, aqueous extraction with conferred nitrogen protection has emerged to be a technique of interest, considering its extremely high production yield. Although linked with high costs, sub/supercritical fluid extraction of lipids remains a high value technique because of the high quality of the extract, amenability to environment, scalability and commercial feasibility. </p>
