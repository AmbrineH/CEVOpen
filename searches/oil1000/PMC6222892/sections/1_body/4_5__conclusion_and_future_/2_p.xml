<p class="p">In order to get the correct nutritional balance in food, there has been a growing trend where the consumption of the whole food (i.e., intact seeds) is encouraged, as opposed to the intake of extracted food components (in the form of nutraceuticals). This approach is laudable, but its practice is limited by the fact that some foods contain indigenous antinutritives that must be removed or deactivated before the food can be consumed. Thus, appropriate means of removing or reducing the levels of the antinutritives (especially the cyanogenic glycosides) in intact flaxseed needs to be given priority. Altogether, flaxseed is an excellent plant food candidate that meets the needs of the 21st century consumer in terms of being rich in nutrients as well as bioactive and functional ingredients. </p>
