 <p> Glutathione peroxidase activity of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, in (a) plasma and (b) liver supplemented with seleno-L-methionine (organic) and sodium selenite (inorganic) Se in basal diet. Unit (U) is nano moles of NADPH oxidized per milligram of total protein per minute. There were no significant differences ( p&gt;0. 05) in hepatic and plasma activity indicating both forms of Se were sufficient to meet tissue need for maximizing GPX activity. </p>
