<p class="p">Health benefit value of Se was used to determine Se-specific nutritional benefits in relation to potential Hg exposure risks presented by tilapia fillets available in the U.S. marketplace. The Hg and Se mass concentrations (parts per million) for each individual fish sample were converted to molar concentrations (Î¼mole kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). To determine whether the amounts of Hg and Se present in the fish fillets would potentially result in a Se insufficiency or a net excess, the difference in the molar concentrations of Se and Hg was divided by Se concentration which gives the absolute molar concentration present in the fish fillets. This results in the relative amount of Se available [
