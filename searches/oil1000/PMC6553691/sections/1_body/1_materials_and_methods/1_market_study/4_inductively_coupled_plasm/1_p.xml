<p class="p">The freeze-dried digested samples were diluted to two separate dilutions based on analyte (i.e. mineral) with 2% (w/w) nitric acid prior to analysis. The samples were diluted approximately 200-fold for the higher concentration metals such as Na, K, P, and Ca. To accommodate trace metals, the samples were diluted 10-fold. The dilutions were necessary to reduce the concentrations of acids going on to the instrument as well as to reduce contamination and to allow the analyte concentrations to fall within the calibration range. The calibration standards and ranges for each element are shown in

Sample acquisition was performed on an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using a custom method that utilized the helium mode octopole reaction system (ORS) to reduce and/or remove potential matrix interferences while simultaneously maintaining the lower detection limits needed for the analysis [
