<p class="p">Samples were digested using a modified method adopted from Olmedo et al, [
 <xref rid="pone.0217043.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Briefly, 0.5 g of each sample was weighed into MARS 5 microwave Teflon vessels (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC, USA) in duplicate, that had been subjected to an anti-static gun. Samples were digested using 8 mL of 35% (w/w) nitric acid and 2 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (w/w). Before digestion, the vessels were briefly swirled to mix and allowed to sit open for approximately 10 minutes. The microwave program performed a ramp to 180 °C over 20 minutes and then held at that temperature for 10 minutes before cooling to 50 °C. After digestion, the samples were transferred to polypropylene (PP) tubes and the vessels were quantitatively rinsed using 2% (w/w) nitric acid.
