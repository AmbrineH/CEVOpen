<p class="p">Standard solutions for analyzed elements (HPLC grade [S, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mb, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Se, and Zn], Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) were used from 1000 mg L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> stock solution to develop calibration curves. All aqueous solutions of reagents and standards were prepared using ultra-pure water (Milli- RO 12 plus Milli-Q purification system for water, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Trace grade (35% w/v) nitric acid (Sigma Aldrich, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and hydrogen peroxide (30% w/v) (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) were used for digestion of the fish fillets digestion. All glass and polythetrafluoroethyelene (PTFE) vessel liners were cleaned by soaking in 20% v/v HNO3 for 24 h, then triple-rinsed with ultra-pure water and dried.
