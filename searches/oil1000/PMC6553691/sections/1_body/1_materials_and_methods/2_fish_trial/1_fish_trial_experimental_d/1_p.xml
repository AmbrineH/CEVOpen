<p class="p">All procedures have been approved by Virginia Tech’s Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (VT-IACUC-#16–099). A 7-week grow out trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of inorganic versus organic Se on Nile tilapia. One hundred and sixty-eight tilapia were acquired from Genetic Spring (Akvaforsk Genetics Center, Miami, FL, USA). After a month of acclimatization, fish with an average weight of 170 ± 2 g, (Mean ± SE) were arbitrarily stocked into six polyethylene tanks (284 L each) in a single recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) at 28 fish per tank. The RAS system was equipped with bead and sand filters for mechanical filtration, bioreactor for nitrification, UV disinfection units, heat exchangers, and distributed diffuse aeration.</p>
