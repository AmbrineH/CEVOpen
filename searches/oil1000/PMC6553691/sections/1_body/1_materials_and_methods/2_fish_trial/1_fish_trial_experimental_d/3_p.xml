<p class="p">Each diet was fed to fish in triplicate tanks. During the trial fish were weighted weekly on a per tank basis. The amount of feed was adjusted based on the weight gain and feed rates (2â€“3% of fish body weight) were consistent between the two treatment groups. Feeding rate was on a percent body weight per day basis. Feed were loaded on 24 belt feeders (four per tank) to deliver feed hourly over an 18-hour period. Water quality parameters (

 <xref rid="pone.0217043.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] as follows: Dissolved oxygen and temperature were measured using a meter (YSI ProDO, Cole-Parmer, IL, USA) daily. Alkalinity was also measured daily using a titration method. Nitrite, nitrate, total ammonia nitrogen and pH were measured three times a week. Approximately half of the sump tank (95 liters) water was exchanged daily to prevent potential Se accumulation in the water. Also, the Se content of water in each tank was measured at the beginning, middle and end of the experiment to check for any Se accumulation in the tanks.
