 <xref rid="pone.0217043.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] were prepared. The dry ingredients were mixed followed by the addition of oil and distilled water. The mixture was pelleted (Mill 72A, Lawson Mills Biomass Pellet Solutions, Ebenezer, PEI, Canada) and then dried at room temperature for 24 h. Experimental diet nutritional proximate and trace mineral concentrations for the various diets are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0217043.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Feed was then stored in a commercial refrigerator at a temperature between 0–3.5 °C until it was used. Diets were supplemented with 1 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> of Se in forms of sodium selenite (2.83 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and seleno-L- methionine (2.19 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">-1-</sup>). Concentration of Se in each diet was measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis as described above. Dietary Se concentration were measured to be 2.01 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for the inorganic Se diet and 2.23 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for organic Se diet.
