<p class="p">Sections of the intestine from each treatment group were preserved in 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.1M sodium cacodylate trihydrate. The samples were washed twice in 0.1M Na sodium cacodylate trihydrate for 15 minutes. Washed samples were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1M Na cacodylate for 1 hour, washed again 0.1M Na cacodylate twice for 10 minutes, then dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions for 15 minutes at each stage [

Dried samples were then infiltrated with a 50:50 solution of propylene oxide: Poly/Bed 812 for 24 hours, thereafter with a 100% mixture of Poly/Bed 812 for 12 hours per manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Blocks prepared for TEM were sectioned with a diamond knife and ultramicrotome into 90-150nm sections on 200 mesh grids A JEOL 1400 scope (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Gatan Orius SC 1000 CCD camera (Gatan Inc. Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to obtain TEM images. Collected images (magnification x 15000) were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institute of Health, USA) [
