<p class="p">Liver and plasma GPX activity were measured using a commercial kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). This assay is based on the method that measures the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (A
 <sub class="sub">340</sub>) while NADPH is oxidizing to NADP
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>. The rate of reduction in A
 <sub class="sub">340</sub> is directly proportional to GPX activity of the sample [
