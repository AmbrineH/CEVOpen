<p class="p">The viscera of individual fish were collected and then the liver and the total viscera weights (g) were measured individually. Liver, kidney and intestine samples were collected for microscopy, analysis of GPX activity and Se content of the tissue. Intestinal samples were preserved in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Liver and kidney samples were collected were stored at –80 °C immediately after collection. Hepatosomatic index and VSI were measured by dividing the liver weight and viscera weight by the whole fish weight respectively.</p>
