<p class="p">Food conversion ratio, survival rates, and weight gain were used to compare the production between the two treatment groups. Survival was assessed daily and FCR was determined by dividing amount of feed provided for consumption by the weight gain of fish on a per tank weekly basis. Weight gain was calculated weekly. Also, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) and viscerosomatic index (VSI) biometrics were assessed for each treatment group at the end of feeding trial.</p>
