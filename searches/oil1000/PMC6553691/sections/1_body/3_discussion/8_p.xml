A 100 g serving of tilapia fillets enriched with organic Se in this study had 0.56 μg of Se which satisfies the recommended intake level per day completely for both children and adult. However, fillets from market study and organic fed fish had 0.22 and 0.2 μg of Se per serving (100 g) that can only satisfy 68% of DRI for children and 38% of DRI for adults.
