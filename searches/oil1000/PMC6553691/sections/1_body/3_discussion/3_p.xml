<p class="p">Recent studies have shown that fish rich in Se provides healthy nutrients while minimizing risks associated with Hg exposure. Therefore, in addition to total Hg measurement, the Hg health risk associated with consumption of tilapia from U.S. marketplace was investigated by measuring HBV. This criterion considers both Se and Hg concentrations and is proposed as a more reliable risk assessment index in regard to Hg exposures. Tilapia fillets had positive HBVâ€™s which is an indication that health benefits outweigh risks related to Hg exposures.</p>
