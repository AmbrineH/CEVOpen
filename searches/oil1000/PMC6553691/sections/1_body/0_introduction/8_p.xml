<p class="p">The effects of dietary organic and inorganic Se on growth performance, biometrics, plasma and hepatic GPX activity and tissue assimilation of Se was compared to identify species of Se that lead to higher tissue and plasma concentrations. The effect on fish production was evaluated by measuring food conversion ratio (FCR), growth rate, survival, and intestinal microvilli length. The information on Se concentration of tilapia fillets obtained in market study was used to evaluate the success of supplementation of aquafeed with organic and inorganic Se for fortifying Nile tilapia fillets with Se. This was done by comparing the Se concentrations of fillets from market survey to Se concentrations of tilapia fillets from fish trial.</p>
