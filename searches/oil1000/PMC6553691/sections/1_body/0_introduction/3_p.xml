<p class="p">Being part of numerous enzymes, minerals participate in many vital biological processes for human and animals. In this context selenium (Se) is one of the most interesting elements. Selenium is the functional component of selenocysteine (Sec), a Se containing amino acid genetically encoded for incorporation into the active sites of unique proteins (selenoproteins) which are expressed in all vertebrates [
 <xref rid="pone.0217043.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. One of the best studied selenoproteins is glutathione peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.9) [
 <xref rid="pone.0217043.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. This enzyme protects the cell membranes against oxidative damage by catalyzing the reactions that are essential for the conversion of hydrogen peroxide and fatty acid hydroperoxides to water and fatty acid. Glutathione peroxidase is measured to evaluate the bioactive status of Se in humans and animal tissues. Selenium is important for various aspects of human health, including optimal immune response, proper thyroid hormone metabolism, cardiovascular health and prevention of neurodegeneration and cancer and antagonism effect against methylmercury and other heavy metal toxicities[
