<p class="p">The results presented in this study have not been published before and were obtained through the research carried out at Embrapa semi-arid located in Petrolina-PE, Brazil. These results revealed the strong potential of the 
 <italic class="italic">Lippia schaueriana</italic> Mart. species as a source of raw material to obtain essential oil that can be used commercially by chemical, pharmaceutical, and fragrance industries. Considering the high potential of this plant species for commercial exploration, as well as the lack of published data, this study aimed, for the first time, to characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">L. schaueriana</italic> leaves.
