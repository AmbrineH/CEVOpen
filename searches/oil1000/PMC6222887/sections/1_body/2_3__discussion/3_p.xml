<p class="p">In a study of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha rotundifolia</italic>, the concentration of piperitone oxide in the essential oil reached 80% [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and was used to define 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha pulegium</italic> chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Among several peppermint chemotypes, some also present piperitone oxide as the major compound of essential oil [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-02480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-02480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. These latter authors attribute that this compound is potentially responsible for cardiovascular effects, antibacterial and antifungal agents, repellents, and retarders of malaria vector reproduction (
