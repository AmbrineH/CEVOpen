<p class="p">The compositional analysis the 
 <italic class="italic">L. schaueriana</italic> essential oil was investigated in a semi quantitative way on a Shimadzu QP-2010 Gas Chromatograph interfaced to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The following conditions were used: DB-5MS column Agilent Technologies (30 m. 0.25 mm. 0.25 μm); helium (99.999%) carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.1 mL/min; 1.0 μL injection volume; injector split ratio of 1:10; injector temperature 250 °C; electron impact mode at 70 eV; ion-source temperature 280 °C and transfer line temperature 260 °C. The oven temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 240 °C at a temperature ramp of 3 °C/min.
