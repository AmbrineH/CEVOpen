<p class="p">The identification of the components was performed based on comparison of retention indices in literature [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-23-02480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. For the retention index, the equation of van den Dool and Kratz [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02480" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] was used relative to a homologous series of n-alkanes (nC
 <sub class="sub">9</sub>-nC
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>). Three libraries of the equipment WILEY8, NIST107, and NIST21 were used, which allows data comparison of the spectra with those contained in the libraries using an 80% similarity index.
