<p id="Par58" class="p">Volatiles are only a small proportion of the total number of metabolites in food yet their contribution to food flavour makes them crucial compounds for understanding food science. For example, a rice grain contains 92% starch and 7% protein but the huge difference in market value and consumer preference relates to the remaining 1% including the volatile components (Calingacion et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2015</xref>). Furthermore cooked food contains many more volatiles than the raw material (Belitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2008</xref>) and it is this complexity which calls for a metabolomics approach to advance our knowledge. Food metabolomics is helping to reveal the mechanisms underlying volatile flavour formation and subsequently the precursor chemical pathways involved. Faster, more sensitive and more comprehensive analysis of food is now possible. Nevertheless, challenges remainâ€”for example, correlating human sensory panel and metabolomic data. In order to innovate, it is important to understand how to make ingredients and food healthier, palatable and more profitable across the entire processing chain. Maintaining positive flavour attributes along the supply chain is one approach to produce better and tastier food.
