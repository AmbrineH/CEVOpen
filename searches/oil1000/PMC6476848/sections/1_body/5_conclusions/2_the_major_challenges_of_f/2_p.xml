<p id="Par60" class="p">Low abundant compounds are difficult to detect. However, in food, these can greatly influence the sensory properties when they also have low aroma thresholds. For instance, volatile sulphur compounds are characterised by their low odour threshold and strong reactivity, making these compounds of great importance to the quality and uniqueness of foodstuffs like cheese, beer, wine and meat (McGorrin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2011</xref>). Concentration levels are sometimes below the capacity of the analytical technique indicating that analytical sensitivity can be lower than human detectability. Odour thresholds play an important role in sensory analysis. Some compounds result in intensive aromas even at trace concentrations, while other compounds can change aroma profiles at differing concentrations. Furthermore, food matrices can also influence the perception of individual compounds as compared to the overall flavour of the mixture.
