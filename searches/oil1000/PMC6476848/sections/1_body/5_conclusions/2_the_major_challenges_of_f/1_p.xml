<p id="Par59" class="p">The overall metabolite analysis of the complex matrices typical of processed foods is one of the biggest challenges in food metabolomics. Advances in chromatographic separation and data processing are greatly advancing our understanding of process flavours and how these relate to food processing strategies. However, there are still many limitations regarding the separation methods for these complex matrices (Scalbert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2009</xref>). Yang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">2015</xref>) reported a data pre-processing strategy to reduce the masking effect of complex sample matrices. For untargeted analysis, the aim is to detect as many components of matrix as possible. Therefore, metabolite analysis without using solvents results in a much higher (unspecific) coverage of the different chemical groups, as well as a fast, sensitive, solventless and economical alternative. Traditional techniques such as SPME are still being improved thanks to advances in high-throughput instrumentation and data pre-processing (Kataoka et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2014</xref>; Nogueira 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2015</xref>). There is no singular method that allows for accurate, sensitive and complete reporting of chemical species but with these new analytical developments increased comprehensiveness is emerging.
