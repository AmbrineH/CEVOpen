<p id="Par61" class="p">Untargeted food metabolomics is also currently limited by the identification of unknowns. The lack of available libraries with food metabolites makes rapid identification a challenge. In untargeted metabolomics studies, major improvements are still required for spectral deconvolution and automatic metabolite identification. Although major efforts are being made to improve spectral databases, the development of accurate automatic identification algorithms is still subject to the availability of an exhaustive set of reference metabolites (Alonso et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2015</xref>). The identification of unknowns even present in trace quantities in natural foods is essential for novel processing strategies to deliver superior food flavour and quality. In addition, the identification of new ‘natural’ flavour compounds in cooked and roasted foods would doubtless be of great interest to the flavour industry.
