<p id="Par15" class="p">Studying how processing affects sensorial properties of food ingredients used as flavourings is of specific importance. Plants such as onion (
 <italic class="italic">Allium cepa</italic>) are used for enhancing the flavour of many processed flavours due to the high content and variety of sulphur containing compounds. Processing operations such as drying/dehydration, high hydrostatic pressure, ohmic heating, etc. can influence both the abundance and composition of metabolites in the final product. Colina-Coca et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported a new approach using dynamic headspace (DHS) GC–MS for the analysis of volatile compounds in onion to evaluate how processing operations affect the final aroma profile. Metabolomics has also been used for the analysis of polysulphides, which are the primary compounds determining garlic flavour, derived from the degradation of allicin when garlic is cooked/processed (Tocmo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">2017</xref>). To evaluate the effects of processing on polysulphides, GC–MS and LC–MS analyses of garlic extracts revealed that shorter boiling times enrich linear polysulphides, especially trisulphides and allyl disulphides (next to garlic aroma, this confers meaty nuances to the taste of food already at 2 ppm; Burdock
