<p id="Par12" class="p">Metabolomics is defined as the comprehensive characterization of all the small molecules present in a biological sample and is used to compare accurately the metabolite profiles between groups of samples (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">2012</xref>). Small-molecule metabolites play a central role in food quality as they are often the coloured, fragrant or bioactive compounds contributing directly to nutritional value and to both positive sensory attributes as well as negative ones such as the so-called, off-flavours. The general application of metabolomics in food science and nutrition has been reviewed (Wishart

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2009</xref>; Scalbert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2009</xref>) and the importance of improvements in food analytical chemistry, such as high-resolution mass spectrometry and advanced statistical techniques to process the large data sets, have already been emphasised (Rubert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, many limitations are still evident especially relating to the high complexity of the processed food matrices and the importance of low abundancy compounds with low aroma thresholds.
