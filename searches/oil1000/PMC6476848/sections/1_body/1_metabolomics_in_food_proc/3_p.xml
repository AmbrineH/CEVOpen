<p id="Par14" class="p">Significant compositional changes occur during pre-harvest, post-harvest, and processing of foods. Metabolomics approaches have been widely exploited at each of these stages to help advance our knowledge of firstly, which components are present in which parts of our food materials and how they change or appear in time (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2016</xref>) and secondly, how specific processing strategies influence final composition (Tamanna and Mahmood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2015</xref>). Van Boekel et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">2010</xref>) and Tamanna and Mahmood (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2015</xref>) have discussed general aspects of food processing on nutritional components. However, we still need more knowledge of the other quality aspects not directly linked to nutrition.
