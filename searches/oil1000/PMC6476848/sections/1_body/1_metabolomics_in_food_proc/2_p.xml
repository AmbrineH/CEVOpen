To understand the relationship between food quality and processing, a complete analysis of the metabolites present in a food sample is needed (Thissen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">2011</xref>). State-of-the-art metabolomics comprises analytical platforms such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based techniques (GC–MS and LC–MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages (which are beyond the scope of this review: see Johanningsmeier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2016</xref>). Each can routinely be used to obtain metabolomic data sets due to their versatility, dynamic range, sensitivity, unique accessibility, etc. (Marshall and Powers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2017</xref>). Metabolomics has improved our capacity to analyse the overall metabolome as well as helping to perform pathway analysis and metabolite identification (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" class="xref">2012</xref>; Van Duynhoven and Jacobs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" class="xref">2016</xref>; Marshall and Powers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2017</xref>). Here, we focus primarily on mass spectrometry (MS)—based techniques as these are the most widely used in food science.
