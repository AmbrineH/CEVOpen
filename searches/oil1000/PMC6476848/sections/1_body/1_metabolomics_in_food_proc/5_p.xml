<p id="Par16" class="p">There is currently limited metabolomics literature on flavours resulting from processing of yeast derived products. Yeast extracts were studied for the first time by Izzo and Ho (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">1991</xref>) and Ames and Elmore (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1992</xref>), and later in more detail (Ames 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">1994</xref>; Münch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">1997</xref>). Sucan and Weerasinghe (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">2005</xref>) provide an overview of process and reaction flavours. Recently, Zhang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported the analysis of ‘yeasty’ off-flavour volatiles from yeast extracts used as food ingredients. Volatiles have been the most studied flavour compounds although metabolomics has yet been poorly exploited for yeast product analyses.
