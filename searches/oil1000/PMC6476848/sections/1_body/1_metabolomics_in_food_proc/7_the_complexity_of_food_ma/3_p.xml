<p id="Par23" class="p">Studying the behaviour of these flavour-matrix interactions will enable us to understand better the dynamics of the formation and release of flavour compounds in food. Moreover, flavour compound-matrix interaction is not only a crucial step in flavour release research, but also is highly relevant for metabolomics/analytical method development. In metabolomics studies, the complexity of food matrices has become a crucial aspect for method development, especially for untargeted analyses.</p>
