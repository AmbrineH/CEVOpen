<p id="Par22" class="p">Lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates in the food matrix can positively or negatively affect the flavour of food products. The release of aroma compounds from foods is determined by the partition coefficient between the air phase and food matrix (and here also between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases). The nature of these interactions depends on the physicochemical properties of flavour compounds and food components (Jeleń et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2012</xref>). For instance, fat composition, concentration, emulsion characteristics and temperature, can each significantly modify interactions between lipids and small molecules (Piraprez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">1998</xref>; Guichard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2002</xref>). The retention of different aroma compounds in lipid matrices is strongly influenced by their molecular weight and chemical structure (Piraprez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">1998</xref>). Lipid oxidation produces a variety of aldehydes that can participate in carbonyl–amine condensation and aldol condensations, potentially competing for reactive intermediates with the Strecker aldehydes. In addition, studies have shown that carbohydrates can also influence the retention and release of volatile flavour compounds (Naknean and Meenune 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2010</xref>). Generally, mono- and disaccharides usually increase the vapour pressure, which causes an increase in volatility of flavour compounds relative to water. Polysaccharides, in contrast, incur a reduction in aroma release caused by an increase in viscosity and/or by molecular interactions with flavour compounds (Naknean and Meenune 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2010</xref>). Proteins have also been shown to bind covalently to thiols and disulphides (Adams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2001</xref>) removing, in this way, potent odorants from the system. In addition, the presence of polyphenols can reduce the emission (or amount) of pyrazines (García-Lomillo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>).
