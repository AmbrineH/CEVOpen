<p id="Par21" class="p">The analysis of flavour compounds is challenging due to several factors including their high dynamic range, relevant presence at low concentrations (ppm, ppt), high range of polarity, extreme high volatility (high vapour pressures) and the instability of some flavour compounds in dynamic equilibria with other constituents of the food matrix (Dresow and Böhm 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2009</xref>). Moreover, the complexity of the food matrix provides the greatest challenge. The physical and chemical interactions of all compounds present in a food matrix determine the ‘overall sensory experience’. This complexity sometimes incurs limitations to the extraction/separation methods (Scalbert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2009</xref>) but since perceived flavour is not determined by a single component, the identification of the overall sensory-relevant metabolite profile, through untargeted analysis is needed to allow us to recognise which metabolite(s) or metabolic pathway(s) correlate with the food processing strategy and final product quality.
