<p id="Par17" class="p">Metabolomics analyses have already proved valuable to the food industry for the analysis of the aroma of fresh [e.g. tomato (Thissen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">2012</xref>). In untargeted analysis, the aim is to detect as many components from the matrix as possible in an unbiased manner. An untargeted approach is chosen to evaluate the overall metabolite profile of the studied system, without anticipating which (classes of) compounds are responsible for differences in the metabolic profiles. Technically, this is achieved by metabolic fingerprinting or profiling approaches (Hall 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2006</xref>). A typical objective in metabolomics studies is the detection of biomarkers. Biomarkers in the food context are compounds that indicate a certain state or the perturbation of a metabolic system either by their presence or abundance change. Often, a combination of untargeted analysis followed by one or several targeted analyses in order to capture all the information is needed (Esslinger et al.
