<p id="Par19" class="p">However, food matrices are highly complex involving compounds with very different physical and chemical properties. Appropriate sample preparation methods and accounting for the influence of matrix effects are essential during data analysis and interpretation. Extraction of components has been traditionally done by using universal solvents (Patti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">2012</xref>). Solventless extraction of volatiles such as headspace technique is a fast, sensitive and economical alternative (Kataoka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2000</xref>). Metabolites can also be analysed without extraction by using e.g. NMR (Van Duynhoven and Jacobs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" class="xref">2016</xref>), direct infusion MS (Baker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2012</xref>), PTR-MS (Biasioli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2011</xref>), infrared (IR) spectrometry (Aernouts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>), RAMAN Spectroscopy (Goodacre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2018</xref>) and MS imaging (Matros and Mock 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kadam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2016</xref>) as well as the emerging SWATH-MS technology (Stolle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2018</xref>). There is no singular method that allows for accurate, sensitive and complete reporting of all chemical species in a food sample. However, with new analytical developments, comprehensiveness in coverage continues to increase (Lopez-Sanchez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2015</xref>). LC–MS-based methodologies have been proposed to be best suited for the identification of novel bioactive compounds in plant foods because of the compatibility of LC separation with the diversity of metabolites present (Johanningsmeier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2016</xref>). GC–MS-based methods have been broadly applied for the analysis of food volatiles and may also be applied to the study of derivatised, non-volatile polar components such as mono- and di-saccharides, sugar alcohols, organic acids, amino acids, and long-chain fatty acids. Headspace techniques are now regularly being used to study the volatile aroma composition of food products. Each technique has its own advantages and limitations and these are highlighted in more detail for specific flavour compound groups in Sect.
