<p id="Par41" class="p">Soy sauce aroma is commonly used in food processing as a flavouring. Its main flavour attributes are based on Maillard and fermentation processes. Aldehydes, alcohols and ketones were the main volatile compounds found in soy sauce products (Fan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2011</xref>; Zheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" class="xref">2013</xref>). Several methods have been used for the extraction of aldehydes, alcohols and ketones in soy sauce, such as liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) (Xu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" class="xref">2007</xref>) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) (Gao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2015</xref>). More recently, stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) has been tested in Chinese soy sauce aroma type liquor for the analysis of volatile compounds (Fan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2011</xref>). SBSE is an environmentally-friendly alternative characterized by its ease of use, high selectivity, high sensitivity, and reproducibility. Fan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2011</xref>) also optimized the SBSE method for the analysis of the overall aroma volatile profile of soy sauce liquors, including esters, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, aromatic compounds, furans, nitrogen and sulphide-containing compounds, acids, phenols and terpenes.
