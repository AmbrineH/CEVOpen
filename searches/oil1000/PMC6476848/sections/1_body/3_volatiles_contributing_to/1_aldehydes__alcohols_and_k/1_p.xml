<p id="Par40" class="p">Aldehydes, alcohols and ketones are groups of chemical compounds that play a key role in the overall flavour of processed foods and e.g. are responsible for the characteristic aroma of fermented foods (Visessanguan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gambacorta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2009</xref>). Moreover, many aldehydes are also naturally present in fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables, as well as in essential oils. Concentrations increase after thermal processing due to chemical reactions at high temperatures. They can also be formed by oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, by normal fatty acid metabolism or by the conversion of amino acids (Figs.

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). These molecules cover a broad range of different chemical and physical properties and hence, different analytical approaches are needed. Smaller aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, are more soluble in water. GC–MS and LC–MS approaches have been developed to identify short-chain aldehydes. One of the earliest detection techniques for fatty aldehydes was their analysis by GC as dimethylacetal derivatives (Berdyshev 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, headspace extractions are now commonly used. On the other hand, LC–MS approaches have the advantage of the higher stability of hydroxy-aldehydes as compared with the higher temperatures used in GC–MS.
