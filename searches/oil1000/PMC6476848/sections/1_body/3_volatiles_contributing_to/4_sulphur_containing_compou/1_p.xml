<p id="Par48" class="p">Sulphur-containing compounds are among the most important aroma volatiles in many processed foods (Landaud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2008</xref>; McGorrin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2011</xref>). Both aliphatic and heterocyclic sulphur volatiles are present in food at low concentrations, but their low odour thresholds make them potent aroma compounds conferring sulphurous, onion-like and meaty aromas to foods. Sulphur compounds are volatile and many GCâ€“MS techniques have been used for the detection of these compounds, mostly following solvent extraction. However headspace techniques have also been developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of these compounds as shown below.
