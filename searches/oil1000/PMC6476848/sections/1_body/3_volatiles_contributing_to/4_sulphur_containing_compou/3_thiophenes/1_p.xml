<p id="Par51" class="p">Thiophenes are important Maillard products which confer a desirable ‘meaty’ aroma to food. Thiophenes with a thiol group at the three-position possess a strong meaty-like aroma and have low odour threshold values. There are a number of possible routes to the formation of thiophenes, involving the reaction of a sulphur-containing amino acid (e.g., cysteine, cystine, methionine) or thiamine, with intermediary sugar degradation products coming from the Maillard reaction (See Figs.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported the detection of 5-methyl-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde only detected by dynamic headspace/GCMS as compared to simultaneous distillation analysis in yeast extracts used as flavourings. Similarly, Mahadevan and Farmer (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2006</xref>) reported the detection of some thiophenes, aliphatic sulphur compounds, and cyclic polysulphur compounds collected by dynamic headspace concentration of yeast extract pastes. On the other hand, static headspace (such as the traditional SPME), combined with two dimensional gas chromatography allowed the identification of 23 thiophenes in roast beef (Cordero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>) that could be used as aroma compounds in process flavours.
