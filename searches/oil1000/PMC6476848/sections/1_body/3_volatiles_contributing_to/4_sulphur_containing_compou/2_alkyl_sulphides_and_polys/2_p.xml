<p id="Par50" class="p">Many vegetables, when cooked, are used as natural flavourings in a wide range of dishes. Garlic (and other species from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Allium</italic>) and ginger are routinely used in stir-fried Chinese dishes. The most important precursor of garlic flavour is allicin (allyl 2-propenethiosulfinate). Allicin is very unstable and readily degrades into other secondary sulphur compounds and a variety of sulphides, when garlic is crushed and then heated. The sulphur compounds thus formed contribute to the pungent flavour of cooked garlic. It was found that in a GC column, allicin will decompose into 3-vinyl-[4H]-1,2-dithiin, 2-vinyl-[4H]-1,3-dithiin, and a few trace compounds (Ho and Chen

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported the analysis of many alkyl sulphides, disulphides and trisulphides by dynamic headspace (DHS) and GCâ€“MS in processed onion. They found differences in the aroma and volatile content of the samples according to the way the onion was processed (raw, high pressure processing). Tocmo et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">2017</xref>) also reported the analysis and identification of alkyl polysulphides by organic extractions.
