 <italic class="italic">Allium</italic> vegetables and their organosulphur compounds are possible cancer-preventative agents in humans as they appear to inhibit the formation of a range of different cancer types (Omar and Al-Wabel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">2010</xref>). Alkyl sulphides and polysulphides are important compounds for the aroma of many flavouring agents. Polysulphides are formed from the thermal degradation of thiamine and components of the methionine and cysteine pathways via the Maillard reaction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). They contribute to a cooked meat aroma but, at high concentrations they can give food an off-flavour. Many studies have identified these compounds in garlic and onion samples (Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2004</xref>; Tocmo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">2017</xref>). They are created by the degradation of relatively stable, odourless, S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxide flavour precursors and these polysulphides are known to be unstable, depending on the extraction technique. Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2003</xref>) compared several sampling techniques for the determination of Korean cut garlic flavour components by GC–MS including steam distillation (SD), simultaneous distillation and solvent extraction (SDE), solid-phase trapping solvent extraction (SPTE), and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). Thermal degradation of components such as allyl methyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, and thiirane were observed for SDE and SD but not for SPTE or HS-SPME. HS-SPME had several advantages compared with SD, SDE, and SPTE such as rapidity, no apparent thermal degradation, is less labour intensive, and small sample size (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2003</xref>). Five different fibre coatings were also evaluated for HS-SPME of garlic flavour components. DVB/CAR/PDMS was the most efficient of the five types investigated. However, some researchers report limitations on the use of SPME if quantification is desired (Murray
