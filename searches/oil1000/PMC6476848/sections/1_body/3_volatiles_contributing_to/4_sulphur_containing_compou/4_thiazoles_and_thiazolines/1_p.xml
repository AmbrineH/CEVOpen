<p id="Par52" class="p">Thiazoles and thiazolines are important compounds in roasted or fried meat and have an important role in flavour chemistry. Similar to pyrazines, their content increases with higher cooking temperatures and they are potent flavour ingredients with low aroma thresholds. Most thiazoles contributing to meat flavour are alkyl substituted, and their specific aroma depends on the nature and the number of alkyl moieties attached. One possible route for the formation of thiazoles and thiazolines is via the Maillard reaction involving the action of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide in the presence of α-carbonyls, dicarbonyls, or hydroxyketones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) as derived from the Strecker reaction. However, lipid-derived aldehydes can also participate in this reaction during cooking (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and long-chain trialkyl thiazoles have been extracted from meat by dynamic headspace methods and identified by GC–MS (Elmore et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2014</xref>). In process flavours made from yeast extracts, many thiazoles were detected using the same technique (DHS/GC–MS) (Ames and Elmore
