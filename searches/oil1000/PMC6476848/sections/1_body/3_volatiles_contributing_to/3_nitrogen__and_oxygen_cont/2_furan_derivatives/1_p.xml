<p id="Par45" class="p">Furan-derivatives have a planar enol-carbonyl structure in a cyclic dicarbonyl compound. They originate from the early stages of the Maillard reaction and deliver caramel-like aromas (Shahidi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2014</xref>). These compounds are also important intermediates in the formation of other N- and S-containing flavour volatiles as they can easily exchange oxygen with nitrogen and sulphur. Examples of furan-derivatives are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. There are multiple pathways underlying furan and furan-derivative formation. According to Seok et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">2015</xref>), furan is formed from (i) thermal degradation or rearrangement of carbohydrates alone, or in the presence of amino acids, (ii) thermal degradation of certain amino acids, (iii) oxidation of ascorbic acid under high temperatures, and/or (iv) oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids (see Figs.
