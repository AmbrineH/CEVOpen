<p id="Par46" class="p">Furan-derivatives are important flavouring compounds and their characterization and identification by analytical methods is of great relevance for designing and producing high-quality food products. An important food ingredient used as seasoning and widely consumed around the world is soy sauce. Over 300 volatile compounds have already been identified in soy sauce (Kaneko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2012</xref>) with furan-derivatives being the most abundant and sensory-relevant compounds. Kaneko et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2013</xref>) investigated the volatiles of soy sauce and how these change on heating. Aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA) was used. This is the most frequently applied method for the screening of flavour-impact compounds when using GC–O. During AEDA, the original flavour extract is sequentially diluted and the diluted extracts are then evaluated by GC–O to provide flavour dilution (FD) factors. These dilutions are usually combined with extraction techniques using solvents, such as liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), simultaneous distillation/extraction (SDE), or solvent-assisted flavour evaporation (SAFE) (Curioni and Bosset

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>). Several parameters, including fibre type, extraction (exposure) time/temperature, and the saturation of the aqueous phase in the headspace vial, affect optimal SPME conditions. Some studies focused on the selection of optimal fibers for the analysis of furan (Seok et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">2015</xref>) and report the best option is a carboxen/polydimethyl-siloxane (CAR/PDMS) fiber, as this showed marked advantages such as selectivity.
