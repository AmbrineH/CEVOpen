<p id="Par47" class="p">Pyrazines represent an important component of process flavours and constitute a major class of volatiles formed via the Maillard reaction, conferring a ‘roasted flavour’ character. Currently, pyrazines are included in the list of flavouring agents authorized by the European Union which may be incorporated into food products to imitate meat flavours (García-Lomillo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, the majority of the pyrazines in food are naturally occurring and often have a very low odour threshold. The common structure of pyrazines is a six-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogens in 
 <italic class="italic">para</italic> position. They differ in the substituents at one or more of the four ring carbon atoms. Alkyl and alkoxy pyrazines are the most predominant forms used in process flavours. A few examples are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. Alkyl pyrazines can help enhance the flavour of cooked foods by adding a savoury taste to the overall product. They are characterized by a roasted, nutty, cocoa, sweet flavour. Alkoxy pyrazines are also commonly used to add a characteristic savoury, and sometimes, spicy aroma to a number of different products. Müller and Rappert (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2010</xref>) describe the occurrence, formation and biodegradation of pyrazines as used in flavourings. Pyrazines are routinely analysed by headspace GC–MS because of their volatility. However, organic extractions are also used (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2014</xref>). They compared the analysis of the volatile content of two different yeast extract pastes by using dynamic headspace and simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE). SDE extracted and detected more pyrazines than DHS and is hence to be preferred. Adams et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2008</xref>) used SPME-GC–MS for the analysis of different pyrazines formed from several model reactions and also discovered the formation of a novel pyrrole in the model reaction of alanine with 2-oxopropanal.
