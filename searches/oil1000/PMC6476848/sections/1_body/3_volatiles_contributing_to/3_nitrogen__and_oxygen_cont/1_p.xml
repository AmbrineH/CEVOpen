<p id="Par44" class="p">Heterocyclic compounds are found at relatively low levels in food. However, they do add a significant degree of complexity to food and, thus, they boost the overall flavour of a product and increase its desirability to consumers. Heterocyclic compounds are strongly related to roast meat flavour formation during heating and are important compounds in food processing and flavouring. They have been observed in reaction mixtures of amino acids and sugars but some can also be formed from lipids (Whitfield 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113" class="xref">1992</xref>). Furans, pyrroles, pyridines, pyrazines, oxazoles and oxazolines are typical volatile N- and O-containing heterocyclic compounds which are mainly derived from the reaction between cysteine and xylose (Cao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2017</xref>). Apart from sulphur-containing compounds, heterocycles such as methylfuran, pyrazine, and furfural are recognized as potent meaty flavour compounds. Oxazoles, oxazolines, pyrroles and pyridines have also been identified in cooked meats (Devine and Dikeman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, their contribution to the overall aroma is not as significant as that of sulphur-containing compounds which possess closely related chemical structures, such as thiazoles and thiazolines (See next section).
