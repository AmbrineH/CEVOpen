<p id="Par42" class="p">Volatile esters are commonly found in many food products. Aliphatic esters are very important constituents of many process flavours as they give very intense fruity notes. Esters are often characterized as contributing ‘banana flavour’ (isoamyl acetate) or ‘apple flavour’ (ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate). Ethyl acetate is often characterized by an ‘adhesive’ flavour note. Ethyl butyrate, valerate, hexanoate and octanoate are all considered to have strong flavours.</p>
