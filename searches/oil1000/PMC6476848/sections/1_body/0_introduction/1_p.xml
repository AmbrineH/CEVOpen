<p id="Par4" class="p">Flavours are perceived by the aroma and taste receptors in the nose and the mouth, respectively. There are five base taste types (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami), which are supplemented by the specific perception of many different aroma compounds. The most important characteristic of flavour is the aroma, and the contribution of the odorous volatile substances. Flavour chemistry is the study of the chemical compounds considered to cause an aroma and/or taste. By performing taste panel studies, we are able to discover whether a food product tastes or smells good, bad or ‘better than others’. However, it is still not well understood which (types of) compound(s) are imparting these characteristics (Sucan and Weerasinghe

The chemical groups that influence the aroma characteristics of food are mainly volatile. However, non-volatile compounds can also play important roles in the sensory aroma profile, either as flavour precursors or directly, as flavourings. These are related to the sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness and umami sensations and so, they make a strong contribution to the flavour of processed foods. Amino acid components, nucleotides, phenolic compounds, organic sugars and fatty acids are all examples of chemical groups that can have a role in determining the overall flavour of processed food. However, non-volatile compounds are beyond the scope of this review. Here, we focus on the volatile/aroma chemistry of process flavours through the use of metabolomic tools.
