<p id="Par9" class="p">For many decades, the food industry has tried to make plant-based food taste ‘meaty’ in support of the growing vegetarian and vegan communities. Cooked meat flavour has been one of the main focus points in processed food flavours (Kerth and Miller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2015</xref>). The most important step in creating meat flavour is the Maillard reaction. Maillard reactions are a complex group of chemical reactions that occur between amino acids and sugars. They trigger a great number of reactions that lead to the formation of flavour compounds, also characteristic of brown colour formation. The first commercial use of Maillard reactions to produce process flavourings took place in the 1960s at the Unilever subsidiary company Food Industries Ltd. A number of landmark patents were filed (May and Akroyd 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">1960</xref>; Morton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">1960</xref>), which protected the reactions of the key precursors of meat flavour. Prior to this, a savoury character was usually generated through the use of hydrolysed vegetable proteins (HVPs), spice blends or actual meat extracts. However, these materials did not infer the desired meaty flavour (Parker
