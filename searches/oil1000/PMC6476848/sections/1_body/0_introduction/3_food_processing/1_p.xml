<p id="Par6" class="p">Our modern lifestyle and the ever-growing global population have caused increased demands on the food processing industry. Food processing can be defined as the physical and/or chemical manipulation of raw food to generate products that can easily be prepared and served by the consumer. At the same time, processed foods can generally be more easily stored for longer periods, facilitating a broader availability to a global population. Preparation of food involves a great variety of processes; from mincing, to pasteurisation, to cooking, to fermentation, to packaging, etc. Thus, foodstuffs such as cheese, bread, breakfast cereals, tinned vegetables, savoury snacks, biscuits and milk are all processed foods.</p>
