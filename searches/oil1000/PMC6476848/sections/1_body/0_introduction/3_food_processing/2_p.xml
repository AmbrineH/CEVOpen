<p id="Par7" class="p">Food quality can be influenced by the preparation process. This directly affects nutritional value and potential health benefits of food, as well as the sensory attributes (Tamanna and Mahmood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2015</xref>). Therefore, food processing can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Beneficial effects include the improvement of digestibility and bioavailability of nutrients, inactivation of food-borne pathogens, toxins or other detrimental constituents, prolongation of shelf-life and the improvement of the texture, taste and smell (van Boekel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">2010</xref>). All these changes increase consumer attractiveness. On the other hand, processing can also induce deleterious effects, such as loss of vitamins and other nutrients, the formation of toxic compounds or of compounds conferring negative effects on flavour perception, texture or colour. A well-known example for instance, is acrylamide which has been classified as a probable carcinogen in humans (Tareke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">2000</xref>). During preparation at high temperature, acrylamides can be formed in many types of foods via Maillard reactions (Mottram et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2002</xref>) including fried potato products (Vinci et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" class="xref">2012</xref>). By identifying which chemical species directly contribute to flavour perception, food manufacturers gain a better mechanistic understanding of how to produce more palatable food through directing the formation of desirable flavour attributes and reducing the occurrence of undesirable ones.
