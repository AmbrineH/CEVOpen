<p id="Par29" class="p">Importantly, lipids influence the aroma and flavour of other components, are precursors of odour and flavour compounds and many even have odours and flavours themselves (Forss 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">1973</xref>). Lipids are generally associated with more negative qualities of food flavour, as they are responsible for rancidity in oils or lipid-containing foods. However, they can also play a positive role as flavour enhancers depending on product characteristics. For example, short chain fatty acids are mainly responsible for rancid flavours in milk whereas the same acids are essential flavour constituents in cheese. Moreover, lipids also play an important role in food texture (i.e. mouth feel) and thus affect consumer attractiveness. During food processing, non-enzymatic (auto)oxidation of lipids may occur, and degradation pathways will lead to the formation of a great number of secondary aroma-related metabolites that can affect flavour.
