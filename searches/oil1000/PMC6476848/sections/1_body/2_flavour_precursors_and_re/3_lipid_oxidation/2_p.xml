<p id="Par30" class="p">Understanding the mechanisms underlying thermal lipid processing needs more attention. Most lipids are hydrophobic, non-polar compounds. Phospholipids and triglycerides are disassembled during heating releasing short-chain fatty acids with reduced saturation. At elevated temperatures, autoxidation of fatty acids occurs and hydroperoxides are produced. This process involves a free radical mechanism which can be divided into three stages: initiation, propagation and termination (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). The initiation reaction is activated by direct thermal dissociation, metal catalysis or exposure to light, forming hydroperoxides (Frankel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">1980</xref>) which are then decomposed via many routes leading to a broad variety of volatile and non-volatile secondary products. A better understanding of hydroperoxide formation and rearrangement is needed. Advanced metabolomics techniques, such as GC–MS and LC–MS are now being used for the characterization of lipid oxidation products (Xia and Budge 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">2017</xref>). GC–MS analysis provides information regarding the structures of individual oxygenated fatty acids, typically as methyl esters, isolated from oxygenated triacylglycerols (TAGs), while LC–MS techniques allow analysis of intact oxygenated TAGs and yields information on the position of the oxygenated acyl chain on the glycerol backbone (Xia and Budge
