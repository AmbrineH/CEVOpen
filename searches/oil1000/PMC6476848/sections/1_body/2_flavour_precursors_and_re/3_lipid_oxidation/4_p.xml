<p id="Par32" class="p">Hydroperoxide decomposition forms an alkoxy radical which mostly transforms into aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and furans. Which products are formed depends on the fatty acids present, the hydroperoxide isomers formed, and the stability of the decomposition products. However, the formation of hydroperoxides is not the only oxidation mechanism involved. According to Schaich (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">2012</xref>), alternative pathways to the hydroperoxide can occur from competing reaction cycles to form peroxides. These peroxides can then either re-enter the traditional propagation stage or undergo alternate reaction pathways thus increasing the complexity of both the kinetics and the product mixture. Most of the research related to food science has been focused on the autoxidation of the most common relevant acids; oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Frankel (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">1980</xref>) and Ho and Chen (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">1994</xref>) list the expected decomposition products from linoleate and linolenate hydroperoxides (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). The rate of autoxidation increases with the degree of unsaturation. Different mixtures of hydroperoxides and their derivatives formed from omega-3 lipids were characterised using SPME-GCMS of oxidized and non-oxidized flaxseed oils (Nieva-Echevarría et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">2017</xref>). An overview of the lipid degradation pathways that lead to flavour formation is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a. All of these products are of broad importance in (off)flavour determination—for example, 2,4-Decadienal is known to be one of the most important flavour contributors to deep-fat fried foods.
