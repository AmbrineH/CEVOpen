<p id="Par28" class="p">The control of Maillard products during food processing is essential to prevent the formation of undesired products (like carcinogenic compounds and off-flavours) and to facilitate the production of savoury compounds. For this, we first need to learn more about the chemical reactions and mechanisms during processing conditions. Metabolomics now represents a new approach to help correlate pathway analysis, non-enzymatic conversions and food processing steps (Klevorn and Dean
