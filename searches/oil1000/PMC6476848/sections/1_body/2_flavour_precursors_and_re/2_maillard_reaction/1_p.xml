<p id="Par25" class="p">The Maillard reaction, which occurs between amino compounds and reducing sugars, has been recognised for over 60Â years as one of the most important routes to flavour and browning formation in cooked food (Shahidi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2014</xref>). Louis-Camille Maillard first reported the reactivity of reducing sugars with peptides in 1912 (Maillard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">1912</xref>). The Maillard reaction is a complex of hundreds of possible reactions. Even with the simplest sugars and amino acids, hundreds of different volatile and non-volatile compounds can be formed. This extremely complex reaction has been the subject of much research by food scientists seeking to discover new mechanisms of formation and to identify new compounds that provide the desired flavour and colour characteristics of heated foods (Nursten

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2010</xref>; Tamanna and Mahmood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2015</xref>). The chemistry has been comprehensively reviewed by Ledl and Schleicher (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">1990</xref>) and more recently by Nursten (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2012</xref>).
