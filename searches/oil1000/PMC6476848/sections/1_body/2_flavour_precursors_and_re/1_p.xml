<p id="Par24" class="p">Non-enzymatic reactions occurring in the formation of aroma compounds during food processing include Maillard reactions, caramelization, oxidative and thermal degradation of lipids, as well as degradation of sugars, proteins, ribonucleotides, pigments and vitamins. Once again, the interactions between degradation products can also result in additional chemical reactions. The Maillard reaction, lipid degradation and a combination of both are particularly important for aroma formation in process flavours.</p>
