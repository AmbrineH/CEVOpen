<p id="Par37" class="p">Apart from the great proportion of aroma compounds derived from sugars, amino acids and lipids, there are also other essential compounds found in processed food which can play an important role in flavour formation. Thiamine (Vitamin B1), ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and carotenoids are examples of such compounds. During thermal processing, these compounds can undergo degradation processes and contribute to the formation of odour-active compounds. Thermal breakdown of these products produce reactive intermediates that are common to the Maillard reaction. Therefore, thiamine degradation leads to the formation of S-containing heterocycles, thiols, sulphides and disulphides that contribute to a meaty flavour in cooked products (Khan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2015</xref>). A schematic compilation of the degradation pathways that lead to aroma formation, from the primary precursors, is illustrated in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. Recently, Yu and Zhang (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" class="xref">2010</xref>) described the volatiles generated when ascorbic acid and cysteine were heated in aqueous buffer at different pHs. Many of these were compounds that can contribute to meat flavour such as thiophenes, thiazoles, pyrazines and cyclic sulphur compounds. However, using dynamic headspace (DHS) extraction rather than SPME, Parker (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2015</xref>) showed that 2-methyl-3-furanthiol and many related disulphides were formed in buffered model systems containing ascorbic acid and cysteine.
