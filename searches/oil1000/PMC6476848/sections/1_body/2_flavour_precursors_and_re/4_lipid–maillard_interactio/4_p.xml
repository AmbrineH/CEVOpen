 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2014</xref>) investigated the reactions occurring during the thermal processing of meat. They described how saturated and unsaturated aldehydes, formed via autoxidation of lipids, interact with products from the initial and later stages of the Maillard reaction. Several thiazoles with 4–8 carbon alkyl moieties at the two position have been reported in roast beef along with other alkyl thiazoles. Using GC–MS, longer alkyl chains were identified in the volatiles of heated beef (Elmore et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2002</xref>). In general, volatile compounds formed from Lipid–Maillard interactions possess weak odour intensities and high odour thresholds. These contribute to the overall aroma at a lower level compared to compounds generated in the primary reactions. The strongest effect on the flavour profile when Lipid–Maillard interactions are present is due to the variation on the Maillard reaction products as affected by lipids (indirect impact on the aroma profile). In particular, Shahidi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported that phospholipids and their degradation products inhibit important reactions involved in the formation of heterocyclic aroma compounds in the Maillard reaction. Therefore, in the case of cooked food, this interaction may help to maintain the concentrations of sulphur compounds at an optimum level. On the other hand, Elmore et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2002</xref>), using meat-like model systems, were able to detect the formation of alcohols and alkylfurans instead of the saturated and unsaturated aldehydes when polyunsaturated fatty acids were present. Possible pathways for the formation of those compounds have been proposed. However, many gaps in our knowledge are still present.
