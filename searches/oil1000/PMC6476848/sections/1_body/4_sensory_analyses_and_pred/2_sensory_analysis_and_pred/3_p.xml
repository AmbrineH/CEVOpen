 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2013</xref>) reviewed some of the reasons sensory analysis and instrumental measurements often result in poor associations and have identified issues that need to be addressed in future research into understanding the relationships between flavour/aroma phenomena and chemical composition. One difficulty in modelling volatile odour characteristics is that the perception of flavour can vary when volatiles are present in different food matrices, which in itself by definition also remains subjective. For example, hexanal has often been positively associated regarding green/grassy odour. However, negative associations have also been found, with rancidity and oxidized aromatics.
