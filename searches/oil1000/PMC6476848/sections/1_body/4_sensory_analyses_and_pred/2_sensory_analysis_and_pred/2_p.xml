<p id="Par55" class="p">When designing a food product, it is important to relate the chemical composition with sensory attributes. By knowing the compounds that cause a specific flavour characteristic, we are able to identify the chemical pathway and hence, the flavour precursors that may be ‘activated’ for product formulation. Thus, a good correlation between the chemical profile and the sensory profile must be determined and hence knowledge of the chemical pathways of flavour formation is needed. While there are some attractive ‘proof-of-concept’ examples reported for certain (fresh) food products, such chemometric/multivariate modelling approaches have yet to be applied for process flavours. Prediction modelling of sensory profiles and dynamic modelling of (off-)flavour formation is becoming an important research area in food science. Attempts to relate sensory analysis data to specific chemicals such as volatile compounds have been frequently reported (Lubes and Goodarzi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2017</xref>; Seisonen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">2016</xref>). A non-targeted chemometric approach was use to successfully identify ethyl acetate as a specific off-flavour compound in poor-quality coffee samples (Lindinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2009</xref>). Tikunov et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">2013</xref>) also use a combination of genomic and transcriptomic analysis together with untargeted GCMS-based metabolomics to identify the gene behind the smoky flavour of tomato. Subsequent blind taste panel and spiking experiments confirmed a causal link between a small number of phenylpropanoid volatiles and the smoky sensory trait. Chemometric analysis has been exploited frequently in common processed and fresh foodstuffs such as olive oil (Procida et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">2016</xref>) and apple (Aprea et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2012</xref>; Corollaro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, these associations can often be weak or difficult to interpret. This may be due to the chemometric method used and/or the natural complexity of food and its flavour. Moreover, current prediction models are also limited to a small number of targeted individual compounds, involve single analytical techniques, or are only focused on specific sensory attributes. As a consequence, they are not robust enough and/or do not allow the generation of novel hypotheses for changing product formulation and manufacturing processes. Expanding the prediction models to a large number of compounds and multiple sensory attributes entails both analytical and statistical challenges.
