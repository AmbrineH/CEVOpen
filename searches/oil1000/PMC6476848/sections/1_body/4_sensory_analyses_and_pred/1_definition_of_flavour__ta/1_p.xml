<p id="Par53" class="p">The definition of flavour is the overall sensation resulting from the impact of food on the chemical sense receptors in the nose and mouth (Dresow and Böhm 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2009</xref>). Soluble, non-volatile substances released from food stimulate taste receptor cells, while the volatiles released reach the nose epithelium to give the odour sensation through the so called retro-nasal pathway (Guichard and Salles 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2016</xref>). The combination of taste and odour is termed flavour. However, the most important contributor to flavour is odour. This becomes evident when a person catches a cold and cannot sense flavour by the nose. Only 200–400 volatiles among 10,000 identified volatile compounds in food are proposed to determine the characteristic odour of a food product (Dunkel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2014</xref>). Analyses demonstrated that some very important aromas are not the result of the presence of a unique characterizing compound, but rather result from a reproducible blend of a particular number of components in a specific balance (Dresow and Böhm 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2009</xref>).
