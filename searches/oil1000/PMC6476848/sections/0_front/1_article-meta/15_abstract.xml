  <title class="title">Background</title>
  <p id="Par1" class="p">When foods are processed or cooked, many chemical reactions occur involving a wide range of metabolites including sugars, amino acids and lipids. These chemical processes often lead to the formation of volatile aroma compounds that can make food tastier or may introduce off-flavours. Metabolomics tools are only now being used to study the formation of these flavour compounds in order to understand better the beneficial and less beneficial aspects of food processing.</p>

  <title class="title">Aim of review</title>
  <p id="Par2" class="p">To provide a critical overview of the diverse MS-based studies carried out in recent years in food metabolomics and to review some biochemical properties and flavour characteristics of the different groups of aroma-related metabolites. A description of volatiles from processed foods, and their relevant chemical and sensorial characteristics is provided. In addition, this review also summarizes the formation of the flavour compounds from their precursors, and the interconnections between Maillard reactions and the amino acid, lipid, and carbohydrate degradation pathways.</p>

  <p id="Par3" class="p">This review provides new insights into processed ingredients and describes how metabolomics will help to enable us to produce, preserve, design and distribute higher-quality foods for health promotion and better flavour.</p>
