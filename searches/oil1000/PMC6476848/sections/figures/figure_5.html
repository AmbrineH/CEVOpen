 <p> An overview of the chemical reactions relevant to flavour formation, modified from Sucan and Weerasinghe ( 2005). The typical complexity of the volatile components in food products is the result of both the modification of the original chemical constituents of the raw materials during processing as well as the subsequent interactions within and between the different chemical groups catalysed by enzymatic and thermo/chemical reactions </p>
