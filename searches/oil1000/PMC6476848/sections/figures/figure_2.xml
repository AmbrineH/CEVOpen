  <p class="p">One of the most important sources of typical food metabolites which are of great influence to food flavour and quality arise through usually heat-induced chemical reactions generally grouped under the term ‘Maillard reactions’. Here we present a schematic overview of the Maillard reaction, based on Hodge (
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">1953</xref>) and van Boekel (
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">2006</xref>), that shows the main-end products contributing to flavour. (I) Early stage (a: sugar-amine condensation; b:amadori rearrangement); (II) Intermediate stage (c: sugar dehydration; d: sugar fragmentation; e: strecker degradation/amino acid degradation); (III) final stage (f: aldol condensation; g: aldehyde-amine condensation and formation of melanoidins)
