 <p> Foods generally have a more complex chemical composition that the fresh materials used for their production. Many new compounds are formed during the main processing steps involving non-enzymic reactions. Here as an example, we show an overview of the common volatile products formed from the interaction of Maillard reaction and lipid autoxidation (modified from Whitfield 1992) </p>
