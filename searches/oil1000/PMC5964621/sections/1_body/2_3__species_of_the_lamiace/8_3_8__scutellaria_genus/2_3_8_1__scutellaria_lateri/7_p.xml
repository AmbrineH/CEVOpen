<p class="p">This compound most likely exerts its analgesic effects through modulating the inflammatory process. Baicalein's anti-inflammatory activity can partly be explained by its inhibitory effects on lipoxygenases—enzymes that play a key role in leukotriene and lipoxin synthesis, thus initiating the inflammatory response. Deschamps et al. found that baicalein inhibits both human platelet 12-lipoxygenase and human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase-1 [

 <italic class="italic">β</italic> and TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> through modulation of the NK-κB pathway [
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">180</xref>] while other authors found that it inhibits protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase [
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>] and COX2 gene expression [
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>]. Pretreatment with baicalein increased the concentration of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, catalase, and GSH in an 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> model of myocardial ischemic injury [
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>] and protected cells against lipid membrane peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">184</xref>]. However, it is very likely that, taking into account the fact that baicalein is effective also in noninflammatory types of pain, it has other analgesic mechanisms as well. One hypothesis states that baicalein binds to the GABA
 <sub class="sub">A</sub> receptor, which has a modulatory effect on pain because GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. When directly injected into the central nervous system, baicalein has strong sedative and anxiolytic effects due to GABA binding [
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>]. Also, a recently published article indicated that through GABA modulation, baicalin could be used in orofacial pain modulation [
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. Another study also suggested that baicalein modulates both intracellular and extracellular calcium levels [
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>], which may play a role in cell signaling and pain transmission.
