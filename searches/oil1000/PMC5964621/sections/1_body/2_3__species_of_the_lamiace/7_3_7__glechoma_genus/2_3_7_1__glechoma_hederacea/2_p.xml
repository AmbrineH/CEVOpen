<p class="p">Current preclinical data indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">G. hederacea</italic> has several pharmacological effects. As such, hot water extracts of ground ivy have been shown to exhibit antibacterial, anticancer, insecticidal, and platelet-stimulating activity [
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>]. Currently, there are no studies specifically addressing ground ivy's effect on pain. However, existing data point out that the plant has potent anti-inflammatory effects. An 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> study revealed that incubating activated macrophages with a ground ivy decoction (3 h in boiling distilled water) led to a significant decrease in nitric oxide production. Furthermore, the authors noted that the expression of some inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12p70 and TNFα was significantly decreased [
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>]. Similarly, Kim et al. demonstrated that several compounds found in 
 <italic class="italic">G. hederacea</italic> inhibit NF-κB production [
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">In vivo</italic>, hot water 
 <italic class="italic">G. hederacea</italic> extract was shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect in a rat model of hepatic inflammation: rats that received 0.5 g/kg 
 <italic class="italic">G. hederacea</italic> extract daily for four weeks were shown to have significantly lower levels of inflammatory cell infiltration/activation in the liver [
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. Additionally, several inflammatory markers, such as NF-κB, TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, and IL-6, were decreased in these animals when compared with the control group.
