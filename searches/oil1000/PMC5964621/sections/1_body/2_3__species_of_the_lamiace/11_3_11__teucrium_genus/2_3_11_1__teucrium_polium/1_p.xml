 <italic class="italic">Teucrium polium</italic> L. is a perennial wild-growing plant, widely spread in several regions such as South-Western Asia, Europe, and North Africa [
 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">208</xref>], and has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammations, rheumatism, diabetes, and ulcers. Two major components of the dried leaf plant extract are flavons and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>]; the essential oil contains 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-pinene (25.769%) and myrcene (12.507), and the methanolic extract contains sinapic acid (15.553 mg/g) and eugenol (6.805 mg/g) [
 <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>]. A preclinical study showed that intraperitoneal administration of 100 or 200 mg/kg b.w. per day for two weeks reduced pain-related behavior in the diabetic rat formalin test [
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>]. A larger dose of 500 mg/kg body weight of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">T. polium</italic> inhibited carrageenan-induced inflammation and reduced granuloma formation [
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. Another study compared the effect of morphine and 
 <italic class="italic">T. polium</italic> extract on the tail flick latency and found the two to be comparable in efficacy [
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">213</xref>]. Both the total extract and the essential oil of the plant exhibited analgesic effects on the acetic acid-induced writhing test, thus suggesting it might be effective in visceral pain [
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>]. Subsequently, a triple-blind, randomized, clinical trial was designed in order to assess the plant's effects on dysmenorrhea. Seventy female students were randomly assigned to receive either 
 <italic class="italic">T. polium</italic> powder every six hours for the first three days of their menstrual cycle or 250 mg mefenamic acid. Study results indicated that the two are equally effective, thus concluding that 
 <italic class="italic">T. polium</italic> is effective in this type of pain [
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>].
