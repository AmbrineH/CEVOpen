<p class="p">Other studies [
 <xref rid="B349" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">349</xref>] have also revealed that the extract of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic> leaves might inhibit the formalin-induced chronic pain, abdomen writhing, and carrageenan-evoked edema. High doses of the essential oils and polyphenolic fraction of 
 <italic class="italic">L. officinalis</italic> have similar effects by blocking acetic acid evoked pain [
 <xref rid="B353" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">353</xref>]. This pharmacological activity could be derived from the contribution of various active principles composing the whole oil such as linalool, myrcene, and 1–8 cineole, previously proved to possess antinociceptive proprieties [
 <xref rid="B387" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">387</xref>–
 <xref rid="B389" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">389</xref>]. However, administration of the essential oil with naloxone, atropine, and mecamylamine could eliminate the analgesic effect of the extract, which indicates that the analgesic activity of the extract is dependent on cholinergic and opioid systems [
