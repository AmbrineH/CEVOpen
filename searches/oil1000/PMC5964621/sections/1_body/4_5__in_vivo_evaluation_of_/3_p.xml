<p class="p">Over time, the antinociceptive profile of marrubiin was analyzed in some animal models of pain. De Jesus et al.'s [

These findings show that it is more potent than some other well-known analgesic drugs. The antinociception produced by the marrubiin is not reversed by naloxone when analyzed against the writhing test. Its exact mechanism of action remains however still to be determined, but the results suggest that marrubiin, like the hydroalcoholic extract of
