<p class="p">The Lamiaceae family includes numerous known species that are used as traditional medicine. The present review summarizes the general aspects, traditional uses, pharmacology, and 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies of 
 <italic class="italic">Betonica officinalis, Glechoma hederacea, Hyptis pectinata, Lavandula</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Leonurus cardiaca, Lamium</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Melissa officinalis, Mentha</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Marrubium vulgare, Origanum</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Ocimum</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Satureja hortensis, Stachys lavandulifolia, Scutellaria lateriflora, Sideritis</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Teucrium</italic> genus
 <italic class="italic">, Thymus</italic> genus, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ziziphora tenuior</italic>, belonging to Lamiaceae botanical genus. The above-referred studies reported that the abovementioned medicinal plants have potent analgesic and antinociceptive activity. The findings of this review are promising, regarding new potential therapeutic agents with possible modulation in pain therapy. Most of the extracts identified did not present any toxic capabilities or known side effects and were at least as efficient as currently used synthetic drugs. Overall, although promising information evidence the efficacy of Lamiaceae genus in the treatment of pain associated disorders, the data are too preliminary and mostly fail to explain the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of action and the respective active compounds. Therefore, future studies should be focused on investigating mechanisms of actions, realistic dosages, clinical efficacy, and safety of the extracts and active compounds in pain treatment. This review covers a useful approach for further identification of new compounds from various medicinal plants, which may be effective in pain management.
