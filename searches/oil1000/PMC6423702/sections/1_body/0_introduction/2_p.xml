<p id="p0010" class="p">For decades and precisely with the beginning of energy evolution, insulating liquids have been used for the insulation and cooling of electrical devices such as transformers, cables, switches and capacitors. Naphthenic mineral oil has long been the most preferred insulating liquid for power transformer insulation because it has a good pouring point at low temperatures, good thermal cooling capacity, low cost, high efficiency and availability on the transformers market [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Despite the previously cited advantages, the disadvantages of naphthenic mineral oil, such as its high fire risk and low biodegradability potential in addition to its scarcity in the future because the oil resources will run out, have made it necessary to look for another ecological insulating liquid which has a high solubility in water and an excellent biodegradability [

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In order to find an alternative insulating liquid to the mineral oil used for the insulation and cooling of transformers, many studies have been carried out by several university research centers and by the manufacturers and users of power transformers [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. These studies deal mainly with the physicochemical properties of natural esters as ecological and low-flammable esters [

The study of the physicochemical properties of natural esters and their comparison with those of mineral oils is therefore still held nowadays by several laboratories in the world. Different natural esters and their mixtures with mineral oil have already been tested and compared with the mineral oil in bath conditions new and aged [

The main purpose of our study is to participate in the search for an insulating liquid based on natural ester as an alternative to the mineral oil of power transformers mounted in the countries of the Mediterranean basin where the climate is hot as Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco...
