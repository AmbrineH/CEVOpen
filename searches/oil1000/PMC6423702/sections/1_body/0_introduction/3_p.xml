<p id="p0015" class="p">The purpose of our work is to study the electrical characteristics of different insulating oils and different types of mineral oil mixtures with natural esters. In the first part of this document, we mainly present a comparison of the change in the breakdown voltage values of these mixtures in terms of the ageing time. The second part is devoted to the presentation of the results obtained during the study of the physicochemical characteristics of these insulating liquids such as: viscosity, dissipation factor, water content, resistivity...</p>
