 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>, it is noticed that the dissipation factor tgδ also increases with the rise of temperature and depends on the type of insulating liquid. The figure proves that the tgδ increases progressively with increase in the temperature according to the oil types MO, O4, OO, S4 and SO. Generally good insulating oils should have a low tgδ. According to this hypothesis, as soon as the temperature exceeds 60 °C, the good results are observed for the oil MO followed by O4 and OO whereas the liquids S4 and SO are classified respectively the last in comparison with the tested insulating liquids with a remarkable growth in terms of temperature.
