<p id="p0275" class="p">The influence of temperature on the resistivity of the insulating oils is very important. The results presented in 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 8</xref>, show that the increase in temperature is accompanied by a remarkable decrease in the resistivity of the different types of tested liquids. According to 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 8</xref>, the best resistivity is observed for the mineral oil followed by the two mixtures O4 and S4 which have almost the same resistivity values from the temperature of 70 °C to the temperature of 105 °C. It is noticed that the two natural esters OO and SO have the lowest values of resistivity in comparison with the other tested insulating liquids.
