<p id="p0290" class="p">We note that the viscosity of the liquid SO is about four times higher than the viscosity of the liquid MO under different temperatures. For olive oil, the figure shows that the viscosity value under the lowest temperature (40 °C) is too high and can reach ten times the viscosity of MO under the same temperature which makes the flow of this liquid difficult in low temperatures. These results, as shown in the figure, allow us to conclude that olive oil is not suitable for cooling transformers mounted in a cold climate but it is acceptable for our existing climate in Tunisia. Under a temperature of 90 °C, the classification of the tested liquids according to the lowest viscosity of each of them is as follows: MO, S4, O4, SO and OO. From the measurements obtained, it is found that the two mixtures S4 and O4 respectively occupy, under the highest temperature 90 °C, the second and third place after MO oil regarding the flexibility in flow.</p>
