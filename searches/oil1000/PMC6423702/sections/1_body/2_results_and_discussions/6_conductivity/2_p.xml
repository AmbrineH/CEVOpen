<p id="p0280" class="p">The conductivity is certainly one of the most important physicochemical factors of insulating liquids. For the tested insulating oils, 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 9</xref>, we note that the conductivity of these oils depends on the temperature which increase leads to an increase in the conductivity of these insulating liquids. From the figure, the difference of the conductivity in terms of the temperature of the two mixtures O4 and S4 are reduced and is not remarkable. For these two mixtures O4 and S4, it is also worth noting that the conductivity values obtained in terms of temperature are close to those of MO which has the lowest values between the tested liquids. 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 9</xref>, shows that sunflower oil is the most conductive followed by that of olive oil and this can be explained by the high presence of ions in these liquids.
