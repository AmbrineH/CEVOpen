<p id="p0265" class="p">The comparison of the flexibility of these insulating liquids in motion in an electrical field is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>. The application of a 2.5 kV DC voltage on the electrodes immersed in the O4 causes its movement. For the same voltage value, we perform the same test with the S4 and MO liquids (Figs. 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b and c). We notice that the movement becomes a little stronger in these last liquids in comparison with the movement observed in the O4 (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>a). The result is that MO is more flexible while moving in an electrical field respectively followed by S4 and O4 and that this flexibility in the presence of an intense electrical field can lead to a turbulent movement in the transformer.
