<p id="p0260" class="p">The physical interpretation of these results is not easy. During the ageing time of the oil, different chemical compounds are formed, which depend on the initial physicochemical composition of the oil. At the 10th day of ageing, the values of the intensities of the field, for the different oil samples are higher than that found at the 70th day of ageing. The explanation of this phenomenon is that at the beginning of the ageing cycle, the oil is a little dry and with increasing ageing time, the amount of water content increases gradually. The formation of water and acid can have a particular effect on the electro-chemical processes at the electrode/oil interface, playing a fundamental role in the mechanism of ion injection and electro-convection in insulating oils.</p>
