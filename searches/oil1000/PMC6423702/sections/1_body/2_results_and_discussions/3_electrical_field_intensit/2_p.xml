<p id="p0255" class="p">The results of the studies carried out on aged samples of naphthenic mineral oil and oil mixtures (O4 and S4), obtained for a negative polarity, are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 5</xref>. The intensity values of the electrical field of electro-convection initiation measured, for different types of oil samples vary according to ageing time. The figure also shows that the mixture O4 has always the highest electro-convection initiation of electrical field intensity values during the ageing cycle followed respectively by the mixture S4 and the naphthenic oil.
