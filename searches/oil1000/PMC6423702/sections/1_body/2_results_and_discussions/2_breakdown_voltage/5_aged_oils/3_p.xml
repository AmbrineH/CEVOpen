<p id="p0240" class="p">We observe in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 3</xref>, that the breakdown voltage decreases with increasing ageing time. We note that during the first 20 days of ageing, the decrease in breakdown voltage values for the different insulating liquids tested is quite low. After 30 days of ageing and arriving at the 70th day, the measured values of the breakdown voltage for the different types of vegetable oils (OO and SO) and especially the mineral oil, decreases rapidly. On the contrary and during the same period of ageing, there is a small decrease in the breakdown voltage for the oil mixtures O4 and S4 and a more remarkable decrease for the mineral oil MO. We note that during the first days of ageing, the breakdown voltages of each of the natural esters OO and SO are higher than those observed for their mixtures O4 and S4. These results are the opposite during the last days of ageing.
