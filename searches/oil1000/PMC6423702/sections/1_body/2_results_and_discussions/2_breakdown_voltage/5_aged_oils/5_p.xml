<p id="p0250" class="p">The Karl Fischer method allowed us to measure the amount of water in each sample of aged oil. Although the increase in water content is due to increasing ageing time, aged sample of oil mixture O4 has the lowest water contentcompared to OO and SO. From both Figs. 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, the output is a close correlation between the breakdown voltage of insulating oil and the amount of water it contains. Thus, it is clear that the growth of the water content with the ageing time of the insulating liquid follows a law similar to the growth of the breakdown voltage in terms of ageing time. According to this 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 4</xref>, it is remarkable that the ageing time leads to an increase of the water quantity in the insulating liquid and allows the decrease of its breakdown voltage.
