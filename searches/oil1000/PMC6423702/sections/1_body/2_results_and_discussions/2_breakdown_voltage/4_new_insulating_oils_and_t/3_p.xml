<p id="p0230" class="p">It is obvious that the breakdown voltages of olive oil and sunflower oil are respectively about 45% and 34% higher than the breakdown voltage of mineral oil. For both mixtures, the percentage decrease in the amount of mineral oil and its replacement with the same percentage of one of the natural esters leads to the increase of the breakdown voltage of the mixtures. According to 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, it is also worth noting that the mixture of mineral oil with vegetable oil (olive oil and sunflower oil) reduces the breakdown of the studied samples approximately between 10 and 35%. At point 5 (O4 and S4) of 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, the measured values of the breakdown voltages are respectively represented 38.6 kV and 37.5 kV of the two mixtures O4 = 50% MO + 50% OO and S4 = 50% MO + 50% SO. These percentage proportions will therefore be taken into consideration for the study of the dielectric properties of these mixtures because their acceptable breakdown voltage value in addition to their low cost and eco-friendliness.
