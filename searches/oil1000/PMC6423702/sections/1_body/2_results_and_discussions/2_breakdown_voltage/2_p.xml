<p id="p0215" class="p">The measurement of the breakdown voltage of the insulating oils used for the insulation and cooling of the transformers is an essential factor to evaluate the dielectric strength of these oils. The good interaction of most vegetable oils due to breakdown is related to the fact that these oils have a better affinity for water than naphthenic mineral oil, allowing them to have a low sensitivity to water content. In this work, the measurement of this voltage for different oil types and oil mixtures before and after their ageing is carried out.</p>
