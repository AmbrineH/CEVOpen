<p id="p0120" class="p">In transformers, oil is used as insulation and cooling medium. To obtain good insulation, the value of the resistivity of the oil must be high. The purpose of measuring the resistivity of an insulating liquid is to study the ability of this liquid to oppose the electric power. In this work, measurements are performed in accordance with IEC 60247
