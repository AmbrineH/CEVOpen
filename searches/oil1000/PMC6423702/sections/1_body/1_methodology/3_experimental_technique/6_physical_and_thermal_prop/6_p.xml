<p id="p0160" class="p">In general, the viscosity measurements of the insulating oils are intended to study the flexibility of these liquids in the flow. Low viscosity of the transformer oil is an advantage for heat dissipation. Measurements of the viscosity of the oils studied are carried out using a viscometer and expressed in square meters per second (m
