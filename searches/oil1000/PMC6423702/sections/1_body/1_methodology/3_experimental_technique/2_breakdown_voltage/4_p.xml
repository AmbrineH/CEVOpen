<p id="p0060" class="p">In order to dissipate the gases that occur during the electrical discharge, 10-minute breaks between each measurement are respected. Note that each time, before measuring the breakdown voltage of the next oil sample, we clean and dry the test cell and the electrodes which must be clean so as not to include craters due to the previous measurement. Due to the importance of the breakdown voltage for the determination of the oil quality which ensures the good cooling and the good insulation of the power transformers, the most suitable choice for the oil mixture, which will be studied later, will depend on the value of this voltage, taking into account its low cost and eco-friendliness.</p>
