<p id="p0020" class="p">In this work, we used the measurement method developed to analyze the oil flexibility to the movement in an electrical field, which can lead to the appearance of a turbulent movement inside the real transformers. The study of the breakdown phenomenon of insulating oils used for the insulation and cooling of power transformers and their flexibility while moving in an electrical field requires a very sensitive measuring device. To investigate the oil flexibility while moving in an electrical field and to measure its breakdown voltage, it is necessary to use a device which diagram is presented below
