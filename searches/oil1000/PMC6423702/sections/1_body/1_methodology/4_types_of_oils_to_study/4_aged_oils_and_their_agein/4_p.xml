<p id="p0210" class="p">In our work, we chose the fourth type of ageing. Our choice fell on this type of ageing because it takes into consideration the main factors responsible for the ageing of oil in a transformer (oxygen, humidity and temperature). In addition it allows to accelerate the process of oxidation of oils and to obtain a more severe ageing. The volume of copper used as a catalyst is calculated so that it is proportional to the volume of the oil sample to be studied. The copper catalyst is chosen in accordance with IEC 61125
