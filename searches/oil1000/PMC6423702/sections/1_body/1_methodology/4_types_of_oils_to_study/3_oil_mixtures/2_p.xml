<p id="p0175" class="p">Each time the mixture of naphthenic mineral oil with one of the already selected vegetable oils are carried out with well-determined percentages. The mixtures of oils samples are carried out using a magnetic stirrer for an hour and at a rotation speed of 900 rpm. The percentages of the mixtures of naphthenic oil, olive oil and naphthenic oil with sunflower oil are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. In this work, we adopt Oi and Si respectively as indications for the two groups of mixtures (Oi composed by the mixture of mineral oil and olive oil. Si composed by the mixture of mineral oil and sunflower oil). The i (i = 1 to 6) represents an index of the oil mixtures and Oi% represents the percentages of the oil mixtures.
