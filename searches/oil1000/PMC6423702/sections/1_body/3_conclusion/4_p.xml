<p id="p0305" class="p">The studies carried out have allowed us to show that the vegetable oils, OO and SO, have too high viscosities in comparison with the viscosity of the naphthenic oil (MO). We have also found that the O4 and S4 have acceptable viscosities under high temperatures. In the conclusion, the mixture O4 can be used as an alternative to mineral oil in power transformers installed in countries that have non-cold climates.</p>
