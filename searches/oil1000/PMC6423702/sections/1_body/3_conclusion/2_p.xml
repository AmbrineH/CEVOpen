<p id="p0295" class="p">In this work, it is proved that vegetable oils, OO and SO, have higher breakdown voltages than those of a naphthenic mineral oil. The results obtained also showed that, at the beginning of the ageing cycle, the olive oil has the best breakdown voltage followed by that of the O4 mixture and that, from the 30th day of ageing, the best breakdown tension of O4 is compared with all the other tested insulating liquids. It is shown that the electrical field intensity of electro-convection initiation of the different oils (MO, OO and SO) and oil mixtures, O4 and S4, decreases with increasing ageing time. Too, the flexibility of these Insulating liquids in movement in an electrical field is more remarkable for an MO than for the O4 and S4 mixtures.</p>
