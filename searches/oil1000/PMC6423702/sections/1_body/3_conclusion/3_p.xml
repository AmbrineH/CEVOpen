<p id="p0300" class="p">The tests carried out show that the dissipation factor tgδ of MO is the lowest in comparison with those of the other tested insulating liquids. Indeed, with the increase of the temperature, the difference of the values obtained of tgδ for MO and the two mixtures O4 and S4 is reduced but the best dissipation factor still remains for MO. We have also shown that, with increasing temperature, the resistivity of these insulating liquids decreases and that the best resistivity is obtained for MO followed respectively by O4, S4, OO and SO. Depending on the temperature, the difference in resistivity between the two vegetable oils is not of great importance. It is worth noting that, among the tested insulating liquids, the least conductive liquid in terms of temperature is MO while for the two mixtures O4 and S4, the conductivity values obtained with the increase in temperature do not differ much and approach those obtained for MO.</p>
