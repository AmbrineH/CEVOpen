 <p class="p">The aim of this work is to investigate the in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrycholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from the leaves of 
  <italic class="italic">Prunus armeniaca</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> in relation to their composition, analysed by Gas Chromatography–Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, at different times. Moreover, considering the role of free radicals in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, the antioxidant properties of essential oils were investigated by using, 2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and β-carotene bleaching tests. The relative antioxidant capacity index (RACI) was used to achieve more comprehensive comparison between analysed antioxidant effects of essential oils. 
  <italic class="italic">P. armeniaca</italic> oils were more active than 
  <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> oils against AChE. Against BChE, the most active was the essential oil from 
  <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> leaves collected in August with an IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 95.80 μg/mL. This oil exerted the highest inhibitory activity of lipid peroxidation with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 11.15 and 11.39 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. All samples demonstrated a remarkable ABTS radicals scavenging activity, with IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values in the range 0.45–0.57 μg/mL in comparison to the positive control, ascorbic acid.
