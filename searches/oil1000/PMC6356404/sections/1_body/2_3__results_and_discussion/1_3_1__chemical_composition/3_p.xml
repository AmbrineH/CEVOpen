 <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> leaves showed pentacosane (15.78–16.83%), phytol (25.83–9.36%), hexadecanoic acid (6.33–7.67%), and benzaldehyde (5.66%) as the most abundant constituents. Other alkanes identified in high percentages were tricosane, heptacosane, and nonacosane. Some differences can be highlighted in the three months of collection (samples P4–P6). Indeed, the essential oil, P4, showed the presence of of γ-cadinene (0.71%) and δ-cadinene (0.42%), identified in trace in the other two samples, P5 and P6. Moreover, the essential oil, P6, was characterized by the presence of
