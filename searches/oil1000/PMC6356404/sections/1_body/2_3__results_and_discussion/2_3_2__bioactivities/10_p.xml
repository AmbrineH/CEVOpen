<p class="p">Phytol inhibited AChE and BChE with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 2.70 and 5.79 μg/mL against AChE and BChE, respectively. Different studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective activity of terpenes. Monoterpenes were mainly investigated. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 0.63 and 0.87 mM were found for α-pinene against AChE [
 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and BChE [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], respectively. Previously, Miyazawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] reported the ability of linalool to inhibit AChE with a percentage of 37% at 164 μg/mL. Successively, Menichini et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] showed IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 225.9 and 456.2 μg/mL for limonene against AChE and BChE, respectively.
