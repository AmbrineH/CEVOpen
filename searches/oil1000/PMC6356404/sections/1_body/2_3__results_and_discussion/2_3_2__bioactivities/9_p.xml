<p class="p">One of the dominant compounds that characterized the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. armeniaca</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> was phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadec-2-en-1-ol). Phytol is a diterpene product of chlorophyll metabolism. Therefore, it is a compound abundant in nature. In a previous work [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], phytol has been demonstrated to reduce the production of free radicals. Phytol revealed a strong antioxidant activity due to its ability to remove hydroxyl radicals and could prevent lipid peroxidation by inhibiting the amount of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Species (TBARS), inhibiting cell damage caused by free radicals. Similar results were obtained with Trolox, used as a positive control. Syad et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] showed an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value for phytol of 95.27 μg/mL in the DPPH test. The same research group analysed the potential cholinesterases’ inhibitory activity of this diterpene.
