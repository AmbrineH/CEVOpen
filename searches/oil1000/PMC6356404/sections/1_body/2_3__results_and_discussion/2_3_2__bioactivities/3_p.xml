<p class="p">In the DPPH test, the most active sample was the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> leaves collected in July (P5) with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 73.78 μg/mL. The other IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were in the range of 80.05–105.76 μg/mL. The different antioxidant activity demonstrated in these tests by the essential oils may be related to the different stereochemistry and training mechanism of the ABTS and DPPH radical. For this reason, after reaction with antioxidant compounds, these radicals gave a different response [
