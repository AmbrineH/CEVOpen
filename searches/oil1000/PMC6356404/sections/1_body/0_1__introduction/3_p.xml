<p class="p">Different in vitro and in vivo works demonstrated the occurrence of oxidative events in the course of AD that support the important role of oxidative stress in this pathology. In fact, it was reported that oxidative stress is linked with mitochondria dysfunction, AÎ²-induced neuronal loss, tau protein pathology, and metal homeostasis disturbance [

 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Lipid peroxidation is enhanced in AD. The most common lipid peroxidation products found in AD patients are isoprostanoids and reactive aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonal, and 2-propenal. Several plant extracts and pure naturally occurring compounds, including alkaloids, polyphenols, and terpenes, have been investigated as potential new neuroprotective agents. Natural cholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine and galantamine, and

 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-aspartate receptor antagonists, such as memantine, are actually used for the treatment of AD. Besides anti-cholinesterases properties, most natural inhibitors of AChE and BChE have generally showed additional biological activities, principally antioxidant activity. This enables these phytochemicals to be applied as a multi-target strategy against AD. In this regard, essential oils, constituted mainly by monoterpenes hydrocarbon, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbon, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, oxygenated monoterpenes, and esters, has recently demonstrated antioxidant and neuroprotective effects [
