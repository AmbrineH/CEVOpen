<p class="p">The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders is increasing. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment and gradual memory loss [

Anomalous deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in different brain regions, deficit of cholinergic neurotransmission, inflammation, and oxidative stress, are some of the pathways involved in the development and progression of AD [
