 <xref rid="B4-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. As stated by the cholinergic hypothesis, the reduced cholinergic neurotransmission in the cerebral cortex and the destruction of cholinergic neurons disturb cognitive function [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Depletion of the levels of acetylcholine has been observed in patients affected by dementia and in vivo studies have confirmed the role of acetylcholine in learning and memory. Thus, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme is an important target to improve the cholinergic deficit that characterizes AD [
 <xref rid="B6-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Another cholinesterase, such as butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, has been identified in humans and showed an auxiliary role in synaptic transmission. Its expression is higher in the late stage of AD.
