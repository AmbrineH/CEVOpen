 <italic class="italic">P. armeniaca</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> essential oils were analysed by GC-FID and GC-MS. GC-MS analyses were performed by using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent, Milan, Italy) with a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) (Agilent, Milan, Italy) interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5973 Mass Selective (EI, 70 eV) (Agilent, Milan, Italy), by using helium as the carrier gas with a flow of 1.0 mL/min. The following analytical conditions were used: 3 min at 50 °C, then 50–280 °C at a rate of 13 °C/min; then 10 min at 280 °C. GC analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu GC17A (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with a FID (Flame Ionization Detector) (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). Essential oils were analysed on a HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) (Agilent, Milan, Italy), by using nitrogen as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.0 mL/min and a split ratio of 1:30. Analytical conditions were: 3 min at 50 °C, then 50–280 °C at a rate of 13 °C/min; then 10 min at 280 °C. Injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 250 and 280 °C, respectively. Compounds’ identification was made by comparing their mass spectral data with the Wiley 275 library and by referring to compounds available in our laboratory and/or known in the literature. Quantitative determinations were carried out by peak area normalization by using an external standard method. Data are reported in
