<p class="p">Relative antioxidant capacity index (RACI) was calculated. RACI is a statistical application that integrates antioxidant results obtained by using different in vitro tests and provides a reasonably accurate ranking of the antioxidant ability of investigated samples. Herein, standard scores were obtained from data from the DPPH, ABTS, and β-carotene bleaching tests without unrestricted units and no variance between the applied methods. The standard score was calculated by using the following equation: (x − µ)/σ, where x is the raw data, µ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation [
