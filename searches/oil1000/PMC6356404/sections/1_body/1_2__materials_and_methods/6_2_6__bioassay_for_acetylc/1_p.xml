<p class="p">Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity was evaluated by Ellman’s method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-08-00002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The enzyme (AChE or BChE), 
 <italic class="italic">P. armeniaca</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> essential oils, and buffer were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The addition of ATCI or BTCI and DTNB solution started the reaction. Then, the reaction was halted by adding physostigmine in plates placed in an ice bath. ATCI or BTCI hydrolysis was spectrophotometrically recorded at 405 nm and the percentage inhibition was calculated.
