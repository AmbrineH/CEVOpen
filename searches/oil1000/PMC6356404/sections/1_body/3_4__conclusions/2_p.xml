<p class="p">One of the dominant compounds that characterized essential oils of both 
 <italic class="italic">P. armeniaca</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. domestica</italic> leaves was phytol, a diterpene commonly found in plants, which has previously been demonstrated to be an interesting antioxidant and neuroprotective compound. However, the unique composition of the essential oils allows for a synergistic action between individual compounds and is responsible for the found bioactivity. The obtained results underline the potential health benefits of the studied essential oils and suggest their potential use for the formulation of new products for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
