<p class="p">Minced meat is a highly oxidizable food. Addition of synthetic antioxidants raises some concerns about its safety. Seeking new ways to retard the oxidation process and spoilage is of most importance. According to the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to evaluate the chemical stability of minced meat with the 
 <italic class="italic">Z. multiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> at abuse refrigerated temperature. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate and compare the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> EOs (MEOs) and 
 <italic class="italic">Z. multiflora</italic> EOs (ZEOs) and chemical quality of minced meat during 9 days storage at 7Â°C.
