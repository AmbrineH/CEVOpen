<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of medicinal plants is associated with the phenolic content of them. High redox potentials of phenolic compounds enable them to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors, and singlet oxygen quenchers [

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The phenolic content of ZEOs and MEOs used in this study was 263±4.35 and 182±4.35, respectively, which were higher than in some other studies [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. There is a high association between the phenol content of plant extracts and antioxidant activity. In this regard, antioxidant activity and phenolic contents of the plant extracts had a linear correlation [
