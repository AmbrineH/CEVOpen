<p class="p">Regarding the complex reactive nature of phytochemicals, at least two methods must be used for determining the antioxidant activity of the plant EO [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Miguel [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported that antioxidants are known as a scavenger of free radicals to inhibit the lipid oxidation [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Therefore, the antioxidant activity of ZEOs and MEOs was determined by measuring the total phenolic content and three spectrophotometric methods including BCB, DPPH, and FRAP assays.
