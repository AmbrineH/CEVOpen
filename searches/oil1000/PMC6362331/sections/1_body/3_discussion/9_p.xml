<p class="p">The treated samples had significantly lower TBA values than the control (p&lt;0.05) in a period of 9-day storage. TBA values of the control sample reached the final value of 2.32, whereas in the weakest treatment group with 0.1% ZEO reached to 1.36 mg MDA/kg sample. The results of the antioxidant activity in the present study were comparable with the results previously reported by Tajik 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] who studied the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. multifora</italic> EO in the buffalo patty. Furthermore, while the concentration of EOs was increased, TBA values had a lower ascending pattern, which was completely consistent with other former studies [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In a study, thyme EO inhibits the increase of TBA in lamb meat during storage [
