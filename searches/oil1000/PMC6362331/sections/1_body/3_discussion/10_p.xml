 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] showed that the TBA values of chicken meat were lowest in the treatment containing ZEO. In another word, the shelf life of chicken meat preserved by films containing ZEO improved from 3 to 9 days when compared to the control samples with no direct contact with the film [
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], which is in agreement with the result of the present study.
