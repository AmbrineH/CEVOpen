<p class="p">Use of natural antioxidant in food mixture is a new spectrum of research in food science. One of the main resources of these compounds is EO extracted from medicinal plants. Minced meat is a highly perishable/oxidizable matrix due to the large surface area, which could easily come in contact with oxygen [
