<p class="p">About 10 mL of acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6) (3.1 g sodium acetate trihydrate) mixed with 1.0 mL of ferric chloride hexahydrate 20 mM (dissolved in distilled water) and 1.0 mL of 2,4,6-tri-(2-pyri-dyl)-s-triazine 10 mM (dissolved in HCl 40 mM) to prepare the FRAP reagent. Five different concentrations: 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 mg/mL of EO (10 μL) mixed to 190 μL of the FRAP solution in a 96-well plate, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The absorbance of the reaction mixture read at 593 nm by use of a BioTek microplate reader (Synergy H4, USA). All experiments were repeated 3 times. A standard curve was produced by the use of gallic acid as reference material. Data were expressed as milligram GAE per gram dry weight (DW) by the dried sample (mg GAE/g DW basis) [
