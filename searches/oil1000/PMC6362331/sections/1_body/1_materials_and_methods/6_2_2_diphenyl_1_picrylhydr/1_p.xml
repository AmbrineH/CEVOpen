<p class="p">DPPH, a stable free radical was used to determine the radical scavenging ability of the EO. EO solutions (at five levels: 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 mg/mL) added to freshly prepared DPPH solution. After severe shaking, the mixture was left at room temperature for 60 min. The decrease of the absorbance at 517 nm showed the reduction of DPPH radical. The degree of DPPH discoloration was showed the efficiency of DPPH radical scavenging and calculated using the following equation: Percentage scavenging effect/% Inhibition=[(A
 <sub class="sub">DPPH</sub>–A
 <sub class="sub">S</sub>)/A
 <sub class="sub">DPPH</sub>)×100].
