TBA (1 mL, 1% in 50 mM NaOH) and acetic acid (1 mL, 20%) mixed and heated at 100°C for 30 min. In each tube, 5 mL butanol was added, vigorously vortexed and centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min. The organic layer absorbance was measured at 532 nm. To calculate the level of inhibition of lipid peroxidation, the absorbance of the samples was compared with those of controls, which did not contain the oil using the following equation. All of the values were based on the percentage antioxidant index (AI %):
