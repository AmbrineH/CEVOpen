<p class="p">Total phenolic content of the EOs was determined using the method previously described by former studies with some modifications [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Briefly, EOs (0.5 ml) and Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagent (0.5 ml) were mixed. An amount of 2.5 ml of sodium carbonate solution (1N) was added to the mixture after 3 min and adjusted to 10 ml with distilled water, and the absorbance was read at 725 nm after an incubation period of 2 h. The content of phenol was calculated as a gallic acid equivalent (GAE) from the calibration curve of gallic acid standard solutions (0–0.1 mg/ml) and expressed as mg GAEs per g of dried plant.
