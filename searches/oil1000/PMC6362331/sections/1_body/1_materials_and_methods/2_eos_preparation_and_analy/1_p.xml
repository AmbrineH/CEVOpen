<p class="p">The plants of 
 <italic class="italic">Z. multiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> were purchased from local groceries of Gorgan, Iran and authenticated at Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. Using a Clevenger-type apparatus, dried aerial parts of the plants were hydrodistilled for 3 h and the oil was dehydrated with sodium sulfate and stored in the dark at 4°C for further analysis according to the method previously described [

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The chemical composition of ZEOs and MEOs was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard, Santa Clara, CA; 6890N) including a column HP-5MS (30 m length×0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 mm) and equipped with a mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard 5973N). The gas chromatograph program was as follows: Helium flow rate was 1.5 mL/min, and temperature increased from 40°C to 240°C with a gradient of 3°C/min. The initial and final temperature was held for 6 min (min) followed by an increase to 300°C for 15°C/min holding for 3 min. Injector port and detector temperatures were 290°C and 250°C, respectively. Identification of the spectra was carried out using the Willey-229 mass database, retention time, calculating the Kovats’ index, the mass spectrum analysis of compounds, and comparison with standard mass spectra and valid sources such as National Institute of Standards and Technology [
