<p class="p">An amount of 0.1 mg β-Carotene, 20 mg linoleic acid and 100 mg Tween 40, all dissolved in chloroform were added to a flask. The chloroform was then evaporated, under vacuum at 50°C by a rotary evaporator, and 50 mL oxygenated distilled water was added to the mixture, and emulsion A was formed after 1 min emulsification in a bath sonicator. Then, 200 μL of each EO was mixed with 5 mL of emulsion A, in open-capped cuvettes. A control was prepared without antioxidant, consisting of 200 μL of ethanol and 5 mL of emulsion A. A second emulsion (B) consisting of 20 mg linoleic acid, 100 mg Tween 40 and 50 mL oxygenated water was also prepared. Ethanol (200 μL) was added to 5 mL of emulsion B and used to zero the spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the samples was read immediately (t=0) and every 15 min intervals for 120 min on a CECIL9000 spectrophotometer at 470 nm. The cuvettes were thermostated at 50°C between measurements. The average percent of inhibition was calculated by the following formula [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>].
