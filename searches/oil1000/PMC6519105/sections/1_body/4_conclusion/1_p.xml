<p class="p">Within the limits of the study, it can be concluded that shiitake mushroom extract has shown the potential antimicrobial effect on the certain periodontal pathogens. However, in the above-mentioned studies, it was found that some active compound of mushroom-like carvacrol has a significant role as an antimicrobial compound. Hence, further studies to isolate and to identify these active compounds require to be undertaken. Furthermore, the suitable pharmaceutical delivery system is needed to allow concentrated extract to be prepared and deliver optimally rather than the crude ingestion of the raw materials, which could promote further bacterial resistance.</p>
