<p class="p">The time-kill curve for the following bacteria was then drawn at their MIC. We found out that Pg at 0.4 μl concentration showed no growth at all whereas Fn at MIC of 12.5 μl showed no growth which indicates Pg is more sensitive than Fn. Pi at its MIC of 0.4 μl showed a gradual decrease in its growth but failed to show no growth after 2-h duration. Aa at its MIC of 0.8 μl had shown a gradual decrease in its growth and after 2-h duration showed absolute no growth [
