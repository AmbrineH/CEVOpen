<p class="p">The present study on the prepared extract of the shiitake mushroom has tested for the MIC for Pg, Pi, Fn, and Aa, wherein we found that MIC for Pg and Pi was 0.4 μl which was seen in the form of turbidity which concludes that Pg and Pi are highly sensitive for the prepared mushroom extract. At the same time, we found out that Aa showed sensitivity at 0.8 μl showing that it is less sensitive to shiitake mushroom in comparison to Pg and Pi whereas Fn showed the MIC values at 12.5 μl showing its sensitivity at this concentration [
