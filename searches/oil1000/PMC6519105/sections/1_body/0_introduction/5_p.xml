<p class="p">Studies have shown the inhibitory effect of various antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, fluorides, povidone-iodine, triclosan, and chlorhexidine on the bacteria grown on oral surfaces. However, these agents might have some side effects which include gastrointestinal irritation, tooth staining, and most importantly, risk of developing antimicrobial resistance; hence, a search of safe, novel and natural bioactive compounds that interfere with biofilm development is required.</p>
