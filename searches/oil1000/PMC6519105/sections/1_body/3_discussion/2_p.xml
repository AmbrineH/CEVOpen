<p class="p">The MIC value in the present study ranged from 0.4 μl to 12.5 μl. Pg and Pi showed the least value for MIC, i.e., 0.4 μl whereas Fn and 
 <italic class="italic">A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> were found to be sensitive at 12.5 μl and 0.8 μl. The time-kill curve which demonstrates the bactericidal activity of shiitake mushroom showed absolute no growth of Pg and Fn whereas Pi and 
 <italic class="italic">A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> showed a gradual decrease in the growth.
