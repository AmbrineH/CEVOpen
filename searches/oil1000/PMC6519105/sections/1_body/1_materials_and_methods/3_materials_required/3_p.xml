<p class="p">A double extract of mushroom, i.e., aqueous and ethanol extract was prepared by a process called maceration. It involves dividing the dried mushroom powder into two equal halves. A 100 ml of 99% pure ethanol and 100 ml of distilled water were taken into two wide-mouth bottles separately. Then, equal divided halves of mushroom powder were added into the individual bottles and were kept for 24 h. Later on, this was filtered using the filter paper. The filtrate in electronic water bath at temperatures of 70-80 degree C, the filtrate dries off and the so obtained residue left behind is final mushroom extract [
