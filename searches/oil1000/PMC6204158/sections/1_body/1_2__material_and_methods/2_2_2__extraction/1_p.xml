<p class="p">The dried aerial parts of
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> Salvia verbenaca</italic> were crushed and 200 g of each plant material was macerated and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature in an ethanol/water (70:30, v/v) mixture with frequent stirring. The maceration process was repeated twice during 24 h each in order to achieve an exhaustive extraction. After filtration and evaporation of ethanol, the obtained aqueous solution was successively fractionated with hexane, ethyl acetate, and
 <italic class="italic"> n</italic>-butanol. Then, solvents of the different obtained extracts were evaporated and the dried residues were used to explore their cytotoxic effect. The hexane, ethyl acetate, and
 <italic class="italic"> n</italic>-butanol extraction yields were, respectively, 1.00, 3.00, and 4.50% for
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> and 1.58, 4.64, and 5.28 for
 <italic class="italic"> Salvia verbenaca.</italic>
