<p class="p">The action and mechanism of
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> essential oil is very complex involving several targeting pathways as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Due to its complex phytochemical composition, it is difficult to define a unique mechanism of its action on the used cell tumor. Nevertheless, the
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> essential oil can act through various mechanisms. Among these are the activation of the apoptosis via the caspases' family proteins expressions, the modifications in signaling pathways, the interruption of the life cell cycle, the modification in DNA methylation, and histones acetylation of tumor cell lines [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The tentative global mechanism gathered probably all these actions which are thus supposed to provide the observed cytotoxic effect. Further studies are obviously needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> in cytotoxic activity.
