<p class="p">In an ongoing program aimed at the exploration of the phytochemical compounds and the biological activities of medicinal plants of Morocco, we were interested, in this work, in the cytotoxic effect of
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> Salvia verbenaca</italic>. The three extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) of each plant in addition to the essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>have then been assayed for their cytotoxic activity against RD and Vero cell lines using MTT assay.
