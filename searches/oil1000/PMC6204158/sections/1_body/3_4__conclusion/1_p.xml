<p class="p">Our results indicated that
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>essential oil and hexane extract showed significant and encouraging cytotoxic effects against RD and Vero cell lines, respectively, and could then be considered as source of novel antitumor agents. The obtained results raise then the possibility of a potential use of
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>as a source of potent anticancer products. This study is expected thus to be beneficial for clinical and traditional applications for
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>as a remedy against cancer and opens new perspectives for further exploration on other types of cancer cell lines. Further investigations regarding the identification of bio-actives molecules responsible for these effects are needed. Examination of the cytotoxic activity of the
 <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> individual compounds would give crucial information regarding the exact mechanism of this plant in antitumor activity.
