 <p class="p">The objective of this work was to investigate the cytotoxicological effect of the extracts (hexane, ethyl acetate, and
  <italic class="italic"> n</italic>-butanol) of
  <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> and
  <italic class="italic"> Salvia verbenaca</italic> in addition to the essential oil of
  <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic>. These plants are widely used in the Moroccan traditional folk medicine. The cytotoxic effect was explored against two cancer cell lines, Vero and RD, using the colorimetric MTT assay. The obtained results showed that the cytotoxicity differed according to the used extract with an efficient effect of
  <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea</italic> extracts compared to
  <italic class="italic"> Salvia verbenaca</italic>. A potent cytotoxicity was thus observed for the
  <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>hexane extract which inhibited the growth of RD cell line at the lowest IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (57.21±3.43 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL). This was followed by the ethyl acetate extract and the essential oil with moderate effects against RD cell line and showed IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 187.52±6.27 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL and 173.05±4.46 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL, respectively. On the other hand, different results were obtained and
  <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>essential oil was the most cytotoxic with the lowest IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value (72.72±2.18 
  <italic class="italic">µ</italic>g/mL) against Vero cell line. In the same conditions, higher concentrations were needed in the case of
  <italic class="italic"> Salvia verbenaca </italic>extracts. The results of this study showed thus that
  <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>essential oil and hexane extract showed significant cytotoxic effects against RD and Vero cell lines, respectively, and could be considered as novel source of antitumor agents. This study is expected to be beneficial for clinical and traditional applications for
  <italic class="italic"> Cotula cinerea </italic>as a remedy against cancer and opens new perspectives for further investigations on other types of cancer cell lines.
