<p class="p">Considering we observed that the majority of unsaturated fatty acids present in the natural soap feedstocks were retained as unsaponified fatty acids in the soaps produced, we wanted to assess the antioxidants, phenolics, and oxidants levels in the soaps to determine if they would have any relationships with preserving the unsaturated unsaponified fatty acids in natural soaps. Cold saponification was used to manufacture the natural herbal soaps evaluated in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). This method of saponification is preferred by artisanal soap makers because it offers more creative flexibilities with the choice of natural ingredients that can be used in the formulation, as well as potentially preserving the antioxidants, free fatty acids, essential oils, and plant extracts used as additives in the formulation [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In the present study, we evaluated the phenolic, antioxidant, and oxidant content of natural herbal soaps formulated with high-quality plant-based feedstock (vegetable oils) and additives (plant extracts and essential oils). We observed cold saponification resulted in the retention of hydrophilic (HPC), lipophilic (LPC), and the total phenolic content (TPC) in all the natural herbal soaps evaluated in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a–c). Hydrophilic compounds (phenolic, antioxidants, or oxidants) are soluble in water or aqueous solvents. Lipophilic compounds, on the other hand, are soluble in organic solvents [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The highest TPC was observed in BB (15.88 ± 0.36), FGA (16.21 ± 0.94), BBR (20.40 ± 1.00) and FGR (13.46 ± 1.17 µmol quercetin equivalents/g soap). The plant oils (soap feedstock) and extracts used as additives to formulate the natural soap products are excellent sources of polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and as such, contributed to the hydrophilic, lipophilic, and total phenolic content remaining in the natural soaps after cold saponification. One interesting observation was that the H soap formulation poorly retained the phenolics, particularly the lipophilic phenolics following cold saponification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The use of additives (rosemary extract and essential oils), on the other hand, increased the TPC content in BB and FG natural soaps manufactured using cold saponification. Polyphenols are known to have potent antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Additionally, the additives and plant oils used as ingredients to formulate the natural herbal soaps could also contain compounds, such as vitamin E, carotenoids, etc., with antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The base bar formulated with rosemary extract (BBR) as an additive contained the highest total antioxidant activity (109.22 ± 5.55 µmol Trolox equivalents/g soap). However, the antioxidant activities were similar between the other natural soaps (BB, FG, H, and FGR), except in HA, where a significantly lower level was observed (67.64 ± 1.03 µmol Trolox equivalents/g soap). The hydrophilic antioxidants accounted for the largest component of the total antioxidant activities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Cold saponification is considered a milder form of soap saponification [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and is preferred by some artisanal soap makers because it can be effective in retaining the fragrance and antioxidants present in the soap ingredients used to formulate natural soaps [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], consistent with the findings observed in this study. We also observed that 65% of the hydrophilic antioxidant activity (HAA) came from the HPC, and 72% of both the lipophilic (LAA) and total (TAA) antioxidant activity came from the LPC and TPC present in the natural herbal soaps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). This is the first time to our knowledge that this relationship is reported in natural herbal soaps manufactured using cold saponification. Considering that we observed between 60% and 100% of the unsaturated fatty acids existing in the plant oils used as soap feedstock were retained as unsaponified fatty acids in the final products (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), we assessed the oxidation status of the natural soaps following cold saponification and curing since unsaturated fatty acids are known to be susceptible to lipid oxidation [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The results indicated that significant oxidation existed in the natural soaps evaluated in this study, with the hydrophilic oxidants being the major contributor to the total oxidant status (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The lowest oxidation status was observed in BB (27.06 ± 1.17) and FGA (30.40 ± 2.31 µmol H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> equivalents/g soap). A significantly higher oxidation status was observed in FG (35.30 ± 1.34), H (37.45 ± 2.66), HA (35.49 ± 1.35), BBR (36.35 ± 1.01), and FGR (36.06 ± 1.01 µmol H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> equivalents/g soap). As such, the total (TOS) and lipophilic (LOS) oxidation status differentiated FG from H and BB, while the hydrophilic oxidation status (HOS) differentiated H from BB and FG. Polyphenols conferred 65–72% of the antioxidant activities observed in the natural soaps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). One of the major functions of antioxidants is to suppress oxidation [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the natural soaps as unsaponified fatty acids are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Consequently, we determined if the observed soap polyphenols or antioxidants were associated with suppressed oxidation, thus enhancing the retention of unsaturated unsaponified fatty acids in the natural soaps following cold saponification. A high correlation was observed between the retention of C18:3n3 and TPC (r = 0.76), with the LPC (r = 0.78) being the major contributor to this overall relationship (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). This was concomitant with a significant correlation between the TAA and the retention of unsaponified C18:3n3 (r = 0.61) in the natural soaps following manufacturing by cold saponification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). Similarly, the unsaponified C18:1n9 were significantly correlated with both the TPC (r = 0.57) and TAA (r = 0.47), albeit a weaker correlation compared to that C18:3n3 and TPC or TAA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). Surprisingly, there was no association between the retention of unsaponified C18:2n6 and TPC (r = 0.06) or TAA (r = 0.01) in the natural soaps evaluated in this study, suggesting that the retention of C18:2n6 may be associated with other antioxidant compounds, such as vitamin E, known to be incorporated in natural oils (used as soap feedstock) to stabilize or preserve the oils from oxidation [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The same observation was noted for the association between the shorter chain (C8:0–C10:0) unsaponified saturated fatty acids and TAA. Overall, these findings suggest phenolics and antioxidants present in the natural ingredients used to formulate herbal soaps were effectively retained by cold saponification, and that both the antioxidants and phenolics present in the feedstocks or additives were associated with the retention of C18:1n9 and C18:3n3 unsaturated unsaponified fatty acids in natural herbal soaps. These findings are of major significance to artisanal production of natural herbal soaps because antioxidants, polyphenols, and unsaponified unsaturated fatty acids appear to be major influencers or determinants of soap quality, consumer perception, and preference of the final products.
