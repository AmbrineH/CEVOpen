<p class="p">Taken altogether, appealing smell appeared to have the greatest influence on consumersâ€™ preference, and that color and appealing smell influenced the perceived pricing of natural soaps. The BB had superior color ratings and appealing smell compared to the other soaps following sensory evaluations. Overall, when unsaponified fatty acids, antioxidants, phenolics, oxidation status, and sensory attributes were used to group the natural soaps, BB had the best overall preference. This is a significant finding because the base bar was included in this study as the control and was not a part of the more sophisticated formulations using specialty plant oils (as feedstock), exotic essential oils, or plant extracts (as additives) that the industry partner typically used to make their natural soaps for commercial sales. The use of these ingredients did not translate to superior consumer preference or acceptance. These findings suggest some of the more exotic additives and specialty oils used as feedstock in manufacturing natural soaps may not be producing the perceived consumer acceptance or preference, and considerations should be given to their use during manufacturing of hand-made natural soaps. This could have implications in the cost of materials used for production and potential profitability.</p>
