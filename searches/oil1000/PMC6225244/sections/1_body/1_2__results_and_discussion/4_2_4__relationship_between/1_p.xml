<p class="p">Considering the levels and composition of unsaponified fatty acids were similar between the samples with and without additives (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), we decided to focus our attention on determining the sensory perception of BB, FG, and H, as well as to determine if there was any relationship between sensory attributes and soap quality parameters based on the unsaponified fatty acid composition. Color and fragrance are two main sensory perceptual indicators of soap quality [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The BB had the highest color preference (7.37/10) and appealing smell (6.4/10) compared to FG (5.4/10 for color and 4.6/10 for appealing smell), and H (1.8/10 for color and 4.1/10 for appealing smell) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This was very interesting because the base bar was formulated as part of the experimental design, where it was used as a control bar to compare the effects of soap formulation across samples. The other soaps were formulated with exotic essential oils as additives, but this did not translate to superior overall acceptance. Shape, lather, moisturizing ability, and estimated price were also evaluated in this study. However, there was no significant difference between the soap types and these sensory parameters. As such, the overall perception and preference were similar between all three soap types (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Pearson’s correlation was used to determine if any relationships existed between the natural soaps’ sensory attributes. The following sensory attributes were observed to be significantly correlated with each other (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>): vibrant color with appealing smell (r = 0.86) and price estimate (r = 0.98), appealing shape with lather (r = 0.99), appealing smell or fragrance with the estimated price (r = 0.93) and overall rating (r = 0.96), and lather with moisturizing abilities (r = 0.85). These relationships suggest that an appealing smell had the greatest influence on consumer preference, and that color and appealing smell influenced perceived pricing of the natural soaps evaluated in this study. Thus, it seems that fragrance (appealing smell) and color were the best indicators of natural soaps’ perceived quality. Pricing, smell (fragrance), and color are major affective response indicators reported in the literature. Affective response is used as an instrument to measure market potential [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Surprisingly, lather and moisturizing characteristics (major indices of natural soap quality) [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] had very little influence on the overall consumer ratings of the three natural soaps evaluated in this study. However, the overall preference or affective response was similar between the three natural soaps (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Consequently, we sought to determine whether the unsaponified fatty acids observed in the natural soaps had any influence on the sensory qualities or attributes of the soaps evaluated in this study. This is of relevance because the unsaponified fatty acids can modulate soap quality, performance, and consumers’ acceptance or preference [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Overall, when sensory attributes, antioxidant activities, phenolic content, and oxidation status were used to cluster or differentiate the three natural soaps, the soaps clustered in different quadrants of the biplot following PCA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). The BB was grouped in quadrant 1 based on the lather ability, appealing shape, overall rating, appealing smell, and the level of HPC. FG was grouped in quadrant 3 of the biplot based on TAA, LOS, and TOS, while H was grouped in quadrant 4 based on moisturizing abilities, HOS, and HAA. This grouping explained 100% of the variance present in the sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>a). Similarly, when the unsaponified fatty acids were added to the model and PCA analysis conducted, H, FG, and BB segregated into separate quadrants of the biplot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>b). Unsaponified C14:0, C16:0, C18:1n9, and C18:3n3 differentiate FG, while H was differentiated by C18:0, C18:2n6, and overall PUFA content. BB was not segregated based on unsaponified fatty acids. Color, LPC, price, smell, and overall preferences were instead observed as the parameters segregating BB in quadrant 2 of the biplot. This grouping also explained 100% of the variance present in the sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>b). Interestingly, BB consistently had the best overall preference of the soaps formulated in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). These findings also indicate HPC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>a) and LPC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>b) appeared to be useful extrinsic cues that were perhaps associated with consumers’ perception of natural soap quality and could potentially predict affective response.
