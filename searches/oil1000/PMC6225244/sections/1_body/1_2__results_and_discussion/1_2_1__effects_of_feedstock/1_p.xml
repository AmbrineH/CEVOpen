<p class="p">Three natural soaps were manufactured in this study: BB, FG, and H (

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Consequently, a diverse mix of plants/vegetable oils were used as the feedstock ingredients in the production of all three natural soaps manufactured in this study. These included shea butter, coconut, palm, castor bean, olive, rice bran, and soybean oils. Interestingly, we observed that regardless of the source of plant or vegetable oil sources used as feedstock, the qualitative fatty acid composition was similar between all soap types (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). However, significant quantitative differences were observed between saturated (28.17 ± 5.84 µg/mL vs. 70.36 ± 7.48 µg/mL) and polyunsaturated (5.36 ± 0.37 vs. 7.44 ± 0.23 µg/mL) fatty acids in the feedstock used to produce hibiscus rosehip soap (H) compared to the control (BB). As such, the Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis of the oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a) showed that the feedstock of both BB and FG were similar (clustered together) in composition, while the composition of the H feedstock was different (clustered in separate quadrants of the biplot) from that of the BB and FG. An increase in total saturated (C12:0 and C16:0) and polyunsaturated (C18:2n6) fatty acids were observed to be the major contributor to the quantitative differences in the fatty acids composition of the blended feedstock ingredients (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Free or unsaponified fatty acids are minor components (1–8%) of the overall composition of natural soaps produced following saponification of the fatty acids or triglycerides in the feedstock with an alkali base (sodium or potassium hydroxide). However, they can be major determinants of soap quality [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], having a significant influence on consumer’s preference or sensory perception of the finished products [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Many artisan soap makers use a variety of fats and oil sources as feedstock, as well as additives and essential oils to make natural soaps, but very little is known concerning how this affects the unsaponified fatty acid composition in their final product. The natural soaps manufactured in this study were superfatted (effective lye discount ratio) at 6%, and several sources of vegetable oils were used during cold saponification to manufacture the final products (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Following cold saponification, we observed the presence of unsaponified fatty acids in all three natural soaps (BB, FG, and H), as anticipated. The content ranged from 8.90 ± 0.96 µg/mg of unsaponified saturated fatty acids in the control bar (BB) to 10.10 ± 0.73 µg/mg in the hibiscus bar (H) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The following unsaponified saturated fatty acids were observed in all three natural soaps: C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0, in accordance with findings reported previously in the literature [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Regardless of the sources of vegetable oils used as feedstock, the level of total unsaponified saturated fatty acids was not significantly different between the three kinds of natural soaps produced (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Conversely, the levels of total unsaponified monounsaturated fatty acids varied with the vegetable oil source used as feedstock. As such, a significantly lower level of C18:1n9 (oleic acid) was observed in the H soap bar (3.43 ± 0.36 µg/mg) compared to the control (4.57 ± 0.20 µg/mg) and FG (4.79 ± 0.95 µg/mg). Rice bran oil was added to the H soap bar, and the olive oil level reduced by 10% to accommodate the incorporation of the rice bran oil in the H bar formulation. This accounted for the reduced level of unsaponified C18:1n9 fatty acid observed in the H soap bar (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) because oleic acid (C18:1n9) is the predominant fatty acid present in olive oil [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. As such, the H soap was observed to have an unsaponified fatty acid composition distinct from that of the BB (control) and FG following principal component analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b). Both the BB and FG clustered in the same quadrant of the biplot, and this grouping explained 86% of the total variance present in the samples based on the unsaponified fatty acid composition. Linoleic (C18:2n6) and linolenic (C18:3n3) acids were the unsaponified PUFAs observed in all three natural herbal soaps investigated in this study. The overall PUFA unsaponified fatty acid levels were similar in all three soap types (4.78 ± 0.05 to 5.40 ± 0.39 µg/mg), even though the levels of C18:3n3 was significantly lower in H (0.62 ± 0.04 µg/mg) compared to the BB (0.71 ± 0.05 µg/mg) and FG (0.70 ± 0.07 µg/mg) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Ricinoleic acid (12-OH C18:1n9) obtained from castor beans was observed in the oil mix used as soap feedstock (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), but was absent as unsaponified fatty acid in the soaps following cold saponification. Collectively, these findings show that the source of vegetable oil used as feedstock can modulate the unsaponified fatty acid composition and levels in natural herbal soaps following cold saponification. The unsaponified monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1n9) appeared to be the most responsive to the variations in the choice of vegetable oils used as soap feedstock and manufacturing via cold saponification. Rice bran oil appears to reduce the content of unsaponified mono-unsaturated fatty acids in natural herbal soaps, when incorporated in the formulation at the expense of olive oil.
