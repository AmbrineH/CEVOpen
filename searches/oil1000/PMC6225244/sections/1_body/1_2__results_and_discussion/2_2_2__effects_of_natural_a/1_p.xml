<p class="p">Natural additives are commonly formulated into herbal soaps to modify the soap composition, quality, performance, and consumer’s sensory perception of the final product [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. These include free fatty acids, essential oils, plant extracts, antioxidants, and colorants [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of information available to the large hand-made soap industry as to how this may affect the unsaponified fatty acid content in the soap produced. In the present study, essential oils + clay (A) or rosemary plant extracts (R) were added to the control (BB), FG, and H feedstocks. These samples are named BBR, FGR, FGA, and HA respectively. The BBA (base bar with additives) and HR (hibiscus with rosemary) samples were not included in this study because the BB, FG, and H serve as controls for the treatments with additives. We observed that incorporation of natural additives in the soap formulation modulated the unsaponified fatty acid composition present in the final products following manufacturing by cold saponification. BBR, FGR, FGA, and HA clustered in different quadrants of the biplot, indicating that inclusion of additives in BB, FG, and H modified the content of the unsaponified fatty acids in the formulated natural soaps. This clustering explained 90.69% of the total variance in the samples based on the unsaponified fatty acid content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>c). However, when the feedstock fatty acids (OilBB, OilFG, and OilH) and the unsaponified fatty acids of the manufactured soaps with (BBR, HA, FGR, and FGA) and without (BB, FG, and H) additives were included in the principal component analysis, the oils of the feedstock clustered together in quadrant 2, and FG and BB soaps with and without additives clustered together in quadrant 4, while H soaps with and without additives clustered together in quadrant 3 of the biplot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>d). These groups or clusters explained 88.8% of the total variances present in all the samples, and indicated that there are similarities in fatty acid composition of the oils used as feedstock, as well as the unsaponified fatty acids present in FG and BB or H, irrespective of whether additives were used. Both the samples with and without additives had the same unsaponified fatty acid composition, indicating the formulation of additives in the natural soaps had no qualitative effect on the unsaponified fatty acid composition in the final soap products (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). A surprising observation was that the overall total unsaponified saturated, MUFAs and PUFAs, were not altered by the inclusion of additives in the natural soap formulations (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). One of the most striking findings observed in this study was that the majority (60–100%) of the unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1n9, C18:2n6, and C18:3n3) present in the feedstock used to manufacture all three natural soaps were present as unsaponified fatty acids in the final products following cold saponification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). This observation was constant regardless of the vegetable or plant oil sources used as feedstock, and the inclusion of additives in the formulation. This is in contrast to the results reported by Bernecke and Maruska [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], who observed that the majority of unsaponified fatty acids present in the soap samples they evaluated were saturated. We note that we were unable to determine what saponification process or superfatting level (lye discount) was used to manufacture the soaps in the referenced study [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Also, in our study, we specifically focused on natural soaps with vegetable oils used as the source of the soap feedstock. These factors could account for the variation in quantitative levels of unsaponified fatty acids present in the natural herbal soaps evaluated in our study. We also observed that between 10% and 30% of the saturated fatty acids with chain lengths between C8:0 to C16:0 present in the natural soap feedstocks were retained as unsaponified fatty acids compared to between 40–80% for C18:0 saturated fatty acids. Though we observed that the exact quantity and quality of the unsaponified fatty acids present in the end products were not significantly affected by the additives used in the formulation following manufacturing by cold saponification (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02356-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We observed significant percent changes in the retention of unsaponified fatty acids in the final products when additives were used in the formulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Essential oils and clay included as additives in the formulation reduced the percent retention of unsaponified C18:3n3 and C18:1n9 fatty acids in HA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Conversely, rosemary extract appears to enhance the retention of C18:0 unsaponified fatty acid in BBR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-02356-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Taken all together, these findings suggest the use of additives as essential oils or plant extracts in natural soap formulation did not significantly alter the composition and levels of unsaponified fatty acids in the finished products following manufacturing by cold saponification. However, the additives significantly altered the percent change or retention of the feedstock fatty acids as unsaponified fatty acids in the finished products. The majority of the C18:0, C18:1n9, C18:2n6, and C18:3n3 fatty acids present in the feedstock remained as unsaponified fatty acids in the final products. That is, they were not converted to fatty acid salts (saponified) during the soap making process. In particular, the unsaturated fatty acids were not saponified when soaps were manufactured by cold saponification. This resulted in significant levels of unsaponified unsaturated fatty acids in the final products. This is of relevance because unsaponified fatty acids can modulate the quality and performance [
