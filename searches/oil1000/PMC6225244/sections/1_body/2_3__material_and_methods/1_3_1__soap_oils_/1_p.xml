<p class="p">Three natural herbal soaps designated base bar (BB), forest grove (FG), and hibiscus rose hip (H) were manufactured using cold saponification. The health Canada compliant numbers for each of the natural soaps are as follows: 006324, 0.006354, and 0.006362 respectively. The base bar was designated the control bar, and contained the following oils and butter melted and mixed together (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>): coconut oil (30%), palm oil (20%), soybean oil (20%), olive oil (20%), castor oil (5%), and shea butter (5%). The forest grove soap was manufactured from the base bar ingredients with the following modification: soybean oil was reduced to 18%, and 2% stearic acid was added to compensate for the reduced soybean oil. The hibiscus rose hip soap was also manufactured using the base bar ingredients with the following modification: soybean and olive oils were reduced to 18% and 10%, respectively, and 2% stearic acid and 10% rice bran oils were added instead to compensate for the reduced levels of soybean and olive oils. The oils/butter mixture for each soap type were melted in a double jacketed melter at 150 Â°F and thoroughly mixed using an industrial immersion blender. Aliquots (8 g) of the melted oils and butter from each soap batch were obtained to determine the chemical composition of the soap feedstock prior to cold saponification. The oil samples (soap feedstock) were designated OilBB (oil from base bar), OilFG (oil from forest grove), and OilH (oil from hibiscus rose hip). Four separate batch (replicates) were independently made for each soap type.
