<p class="p">The effects of the unsaponified fatty acids on the perception of herbal soaps were conducted according to the methods of Garcia-Segovia et al. [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] following ethics approval by the Grenfell Campus-Memorial University Research Ethics Board. Fifty-nine untrained participants were recruited from the student, staff, and faculty at Grenfell Campus of Memorial University who had no prior knowledge of the soap treatments. Soaps from each treatment (BB, FG, and H) were presented to participants in a random order. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire following multiple uses of the soap, and ranked the soaps based on color, appealing shape, fragrance, lather, moisturizing effects, estimated price (were asked to give a price for each product), and overall preference. Acceptance and preference for each product was scored on a structured hedonic scale [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] assigned using the sensory analysis software (SIMS 2000, version 6.0., Berkely Heights, NJ, USA). The ratings obtained from the participants were correlated with the outputs from the chemical analyses (unsaponified fatty acid composition, antioxidant activities, phenolic contents, and oxidation status) to determine relationships between the unsaponified fatty acid composition and sensory perception of the natural herbal soaps.
