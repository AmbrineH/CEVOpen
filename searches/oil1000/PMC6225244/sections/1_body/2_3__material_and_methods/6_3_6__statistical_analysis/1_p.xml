<p class="p">All measurements of chemical parameters (fatty acids, antioxidant activities, phenolic contents, and oxidation status) were made in quadruplet. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the effects of treatments on chemical parameters. Where treatment effects were significant, the means were compared using Fisher’s LSD test with α = 0.05. For sensory perception analysis, results from the hedonic scale were analyzed using ANOVA and frequency distribution analysis, and means (

To test the linear relationships between chemical characteristics and sensory perception output, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used. Principal component analysis was used to discern relationships between sensory perception and chemical parameters for each soap type, and to assess the influence of the unsaponified fatty acid composition on sensory perception of the tested commercial natural herbal soaps. The sensory perception analysis was done using the sensory information management system software (SIMS 2000, version 6.0, Berkely Heights, NJ, USA). All other data analysis was done using XLSTATS (Addinsoft, Paris, France).
