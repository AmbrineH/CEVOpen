<p class="p">Each batch of soap was manufactured based on a proprietary commercial recipe developed by the industrial collaborator using 35% water and 6% superfat (lye discount). The saponification value for all oils used in the composition of the different soaps were determined using a commercial lye calculator. The cold process method herein referred to as cold saponification was used for soap production where lye (pure sodium hydroxide) was used as the base in the saponification process. The amount of sodium hydroxide required (determined from the lye calculator) was mixed with water and left to cool for 60 min. The cooled lye and water was added to the melted oils and butter for each soap type (see above), and the subsequent mixture was blended until thickened (about the consistency of thick cream), but before trace (point where the saponification process is almost complete) was reached (the consistency of pudding). The mixture was used to fill parchment paper-lined molds, and the soaps were left to complete saponification at room temperature for 24 h. Following saponification and removal from the mold, each loaf of soap weighed approximately 1500 g, and measured 2 × 3 × 15 inches. A commercial wire loaf cutter was used to cut the loaves into 15 identical bars simultaneously, with each bar having the same shape and dimensions (measured approximately 1 × 2 × 3 inches, and weighed 100 g), and the soaps left to cure for 4 weeks. After curing, 8 g were cut with a scalpel blade from the center of each soap bar, wrapped in aluminum foil, and stored at −80 °C for chemical analyses. A total of eight batches for each soap type were made for both chemical and sensory perception analyses. Each soap type was designated as follows: base bar (BB), forest grove (FG), and hibiscus rose hip (H) based on their formulation.</p>
