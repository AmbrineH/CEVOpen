<p class="p">To evaluate the effects of additives on the unsaponified fatty acid composition of BB, FG, and H herbal soaps following cold saponification, natural plant additives were added to each of the soaps as follows: To the base bar and forest grove soaps, 0.05% (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of rosemary extract (Saffire Blue, Toronto, ON, Canada) (containing organic coconut oil, rosemary, natural vitamin E, and a proprietary blend of non-allergic plant extracts) was added to each loaf. Both soap samples were designated BBR (base bar + rosemary extract) and FGR (forest grove + rosemary extract), respectively. To both hibiscus and forest grove, a second combination of natural additives consisting of a combination of naturally sourced colored clays (for color) and essential oils (for fragrance) were added. Specifically, 0.05% (

This soap bar was designated FGA. To hibiscus, French pink clay, filtered hibiscus rose hip tea steeped in boiled water for 1–3 h (for color, aesthetic appeal, and fragrance), and an essential old blend containing sweet orange, pink grape fruit, bergamot, vanilla, cinnamon bark, cedar leaf, ylang ylang, cananga, lavender, and palmarosa were added as additives. This soap bar was designated HA. The amount of additives added to each soap type was determined based on the FDA approved usage of extracts/natural preservatives in cosmetics (0.02–0.05% of finished product weight). As such, 0.05% (750 mg) of the finished product weight (1500 g) was used to add the additives in this study. The additives were added to the mixture and thoroughly mixed just before molding. The same cold saponification method noted above was used to manufacture the soaps with additives. Eight grams was cut with a scalpel blade from the center of each soap bar, wrapped in aluminum foil, and stored at −80 °C for chemical analyses.
