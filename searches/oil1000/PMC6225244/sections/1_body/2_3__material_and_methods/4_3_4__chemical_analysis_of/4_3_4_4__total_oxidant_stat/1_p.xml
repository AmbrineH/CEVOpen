<p class="p">This analysis was conducted using the established method of Erel [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The principle of this method is that oxidants present in the soap samples will oxidize ferrous ions and an 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-dianisidine complex in the assay to produce ferric ions. The ferric ions produce a chromophore (colored complex) with xylenol orange in an acidic medium, and the amounts of oxidant molecules present in the samples can be determined via a linear relationship with known standards by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm. Briefly, a stock solution of Reagent 1 was prepared by dissolving 114 mg of xylenol orange and 8.18 g of sodium chloride in 900 mL of 25 mM H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (1.2 mL of 98% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (d = 1.84 g/L) in 900 mL H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O). This was followed by the addition of 100 mL of glycerol to give a final composition for Reagent 1 of 150 µM xylenol orange, 140 mM NaCl, 1.35 M glycerol, and a pH of 1.75. Reagent 2 was prepared by dissolving 1.96 g of ferrous ammonium sulfate and 3.17 g of 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-dianisidine dihydrochloride in 1000 mL of 25 mM H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (1.33 mL of 98% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (d = 1.84 g/L) in 1000 mL of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O). This reagent had a composition of 5 mM ferrous ammonium sulfate and 10 mM 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-dianisidine dihydrochloride. Hydrogen peroxide in water was used as internal standards, where 10.24 µL of 30% H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was added to 100 mL of deionized water to give a 1 mM stock solution. From this stock solution, serial dilutions were performed to give 0, 25, 50, 100, and 150 µM. For this assay, 35 µL of sample or standard was placed in microplate wells along with 225 µL of Reagent 1 and 10.6 µL of Reagent 2. The absorbance was then read at 560 nm using a Biotek Synergy HT microplate reader (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Four replicates were analyzed per standard concentration or sample treatment, and the lipophilic and hydrophilic oxidant status was determined. The results were expressed as µM equivalents of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per gram of soap. Values for the total oxidant status were determined by summation of the aqueous (hydrophilic) and organic (lipophilic) oxidant values.
