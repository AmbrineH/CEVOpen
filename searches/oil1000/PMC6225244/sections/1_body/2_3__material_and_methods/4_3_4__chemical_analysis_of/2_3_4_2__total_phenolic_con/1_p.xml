<p class="p">The hydrophilic and lipophilic phenolic content were determined separately using a 10-fold diluted solution of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent with quercetin as a standard in the range of 0–1.0 mg/mL [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The aqueous phenolics (soluble in aqueous solution) and organic phenolics (soluble in organic solvent) were determined by adding 5 µL of the samples extracted with the buffer or organic solvent, respectively. To the sample mixture, 130 µL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and 75 µL of either buffer or ethanol:acetone (1:1

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) extract was added to microplate wells to determine the hydrophilic and lipophilic phenolic content, respectively. The microplates with the mixture were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, and the absorbance was measured at 755 nm using a Synergy HT microplate reader (Biotek, Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The results were expressed as micromole quercetin equivalents per gram of soap. Four replicates were analyzed per standard concentration or sample treatment. Values for total phenolic content were determined by summation of the aqueous (hydrophilic) and organic (lipophilic) phenolic values.
