<p class="p">GC-MS/FID analysis was conducted on a Thermo Scientific Trace 1300 gas chromatography (GC) (Mississauga, ON, Canada) coupled to a Thermo Scientific TSQ 8000 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) (Burlington, ON, Canada) or a flame ionization detector (FID) (Burlington, ON, Canada). Methylated fatty acids were separated with a DB23 high resolution column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.2 µm; Agilent Technology, Mississauga, ON, Canada) using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. One microliter (1 µL) of each sample was applied to the injection system in split mode (20:1) using a Tri-plus auto-sampler (Thermo Scientific, Burlington, ON, Canada). The oven temperature was programed as follows: the initial oven temperature of 80 °C was held for 0.5 min, then programmed to increase at 4 °C/min to 220 °C, held for 5 min at 220 °C, then increased at 4 °C/min to 240 °C, where it was held for 10 min. The methylated fatty acids were determined from the comparison of retention times and mass spectra were obtained from commercial standards (Supelco 37 component mix, Supelco PUFA No. 3, Supelco FAME mix C8-C24, C16 DMA, and C10 DMA; Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) and the NIST database (Thermo Scientific, Burlington, ON, Canada). The amounts of individual fatty acids identified were calculated using standard curves prepared from the standard mixtures, and values were presented as µg/mg soap [
