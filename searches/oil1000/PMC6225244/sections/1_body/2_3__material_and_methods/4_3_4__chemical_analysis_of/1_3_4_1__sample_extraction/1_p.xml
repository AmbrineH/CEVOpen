Samples from each batch of soap (100 mg) were weighed (4× replication) in glass centrifuge vials. The soaps were cut into small pieces and 1 mL of HPLC grade acetone: ethanol (1:1

The supernatant was filtered with glass wool, and the filtrate was used without further dilution to determine the lipophilic antioxidant activity and the organic phenolic content of the soaps. The undisturbed pellets were re-suspended in 1 mL of cold 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and centrifuged at 10,000×

This diluted supernatant was used to determine the hydrophilic antioxidant activity and aqueous phenolic content.
