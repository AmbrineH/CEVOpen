<p class="p">Soap lipids were extracted using the established Bligh and Dyer method with the following modifications [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Briefly, 50 mg of sample was weighed into glass centrifuges tubes in four replicates, and 1 mL of methanol containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added. Nonadecanoic acid (C19:0) was added as an internal standard to each centrifuge tube (100 µL of 0.2 mg/mL). The sample mixture was thoroughly vortexed, then 1 mL chloroform and 0.8 mL distilled water were added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min. The organic layer was retained to determine the unsaponified fatty acids in the soaps or fatty acids in the oils. The fatty acids in the mixture were methylated by taking 200 µL aliquots of the organic layer from each sample, then dried under nitrogen gas. To the dried residue, 200 µL of methanolic-HCl (3N) was added, and the samples were vigorously vortexed then incubated overnight at room temperature. Following incubation, 800 µL of deionized water was added and the samples were extracted three times using 500 µL of n-hexane each time. The hexane fractions from each sample were pooled (1500 µL), 100 µL of water scavenger (DMP) was added, and the sample was dried under nitrogen [

The methylated fatty acids were then re-suspended in 100 µL of n-hexane, vigorously vortexed, transferred to insert in GC vials, and then analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection (GC-MS/FID).
