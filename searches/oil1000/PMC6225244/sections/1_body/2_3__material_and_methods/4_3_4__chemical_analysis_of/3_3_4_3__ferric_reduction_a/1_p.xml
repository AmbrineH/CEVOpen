<p class="p">The hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities were determined according to the methods of Jimenez-Alvarez et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02356" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. This method is based on the capacity of a sample to scavenge the FRAP radical cation compared to a standard antioxidant (Trolox) in a dose–response curve (0–100 µM). The working solution (reaction mix) was prepared fresh daily by adding 25 mL of 30 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 2.5 mL of 10 mM tripyridyltriazine (TPTZ) solution, and 2.5 mL of 20 mM FeCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O solution. This solution was heated to 37 °C in an oven for 15 min before use. A standard solution of 1 mM of Trolox was made using 6.25 mg Trolox in 25 mL of sodium phosphate buffer for the hydrophilic antioxidant activity or acetone:ethanol (1:1

For hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities, 10 µL of sample or standard was added to the reaction medium to give a total volume of 200 µL in each microplate well. The sample mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at 593 nm using a Synergy HT microplate reader (Biotek, Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Four replicates were analyzed per standard concentration or sample treatment. The results were expressed as micromole Trolox equivalents per gram soap. Values for total antioxidant activity were determined by summation of the aqueous (hydrophilic) and organic (lipophilic) antioxidant values.
