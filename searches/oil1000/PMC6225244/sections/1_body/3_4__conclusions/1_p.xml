<p class="p">There is currently a paucity of information in the literature related to how the content of unsaponified fatty acids in natural herbal soaps manufactured using cold saponification influences the sensory perception and consumer’s preference or acceptance of natural soap products. The output from this study attempted to fill this knowledge gap. We observed commercial natural soaps manufactured from plant oils and additives as feedstock by cold saponification retained significant levels of unsaponified fatty acids, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activities in the final products. The majority of the unsaturated fatty acids present in the feedstock remained unsaponified in the natural soaps after manufacturing by cold saponification. The unsaponified monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1n9) appeared to be the most responsive to the variation in the choice of vegetable oils used as soap feedstock during manufacturing via cold saponification. Addition of additives in the soap formulation had a significant effect on the percent change or retention of the feedstock fatty acids as unsaponified fatty acids in the finished products. Both the antioxidants and phenolics were associated with the retention or levels of C18:1n9 and C18:3n3, but not C18:2n6 unsaturated unsaponified fatty acids in natural herbal soaps manufactured via cold saponification. These findings suggest cold saponification is an effective approach to enhance the levels of unsaponified fatty acids, phenolics, and antioxidants in hand-made natural soaps. Appealing smell was the greatest influencer of consumer preference, while color and appealing smell were the best indicators of natural soaps’ estimated pricing and consumers’ perceived quality, and consequently acceptability. These findings are of major significance to artisanal production of natural herbal soaps because antioxidants, polyphenols, and unsaponified unsaturated fatty acids appear to be major determinants of natural soap quality, consumer perception, and preference of the final products. One of the most significant findings in this study was that the base bar used as control in this study had the best overall preference compared to the other soaps formulated with specialty or exotic plant oils as feedstock and additives. These findings suggest some of the more exotic additives and specialty oils used to manufacture hand-made natural soaps may not be producing the perceived consumer acceptance or preference, and that artisan natural soap makers should give careful considerations to their use during the manufacturing of hand-made natural soaps. This work provides some baseline information regarding natural hand-made soaps manufacturing, which is very sparse in the scientific literature. The hope is that the information presented will stimulate additional studies by other researchers in the scientific community, to further improve the knowledge that may be of value to the growing specialty hand-made soap industry. </p>
