  <p class="p">Principal component analysis (PCA) showing the similarities between different commercial soaps based on the fatty acids composition. Biplots showing clusters of (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) the oils used to make the natural soaps based on the fatty acid composition, (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) the three natural soaps made after cold saponification based on content of unsaponified fatty acids, (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) three natural soaps after additives were added based on unsaponified fatty acid composition, (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) oils and soaps with and without additives based on the fatty acid composition in oils (feedstock) and unsaponified fatty acids in soaps; 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4 per experimental replicate. Unsaponified fatty acids are arranged based on the fatty acid composition with the number before the colon representing total number of carbons, while the numbers after the colon represents the total number and position of first double bonds (e.g., C16:3n3 = 16 carbons with 3 double bonds; first double located at carbon 3 counting from the terminal end. Natural soap acronyms: BB = base bar (control), FG = forest grove, H = Hibiscus rose hip. FGA = forest grove + essential oil and clay, HA = hibiscus + essential oil and clay, BBR = base bar + rosemary, FGR = Forest grove + rosemary, HR = hibiscus + rosemary.
