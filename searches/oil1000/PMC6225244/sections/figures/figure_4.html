 <p> Total phenol, antioxidant, and oxidant content in natural soaps following cold saponification. ( a, d, g) Hydrophilic, ( b, e, h) lypophilic, and ( c, f, i) total phenolic content, antioxidants activity, and oxidant content, respectively, in commercial soaps. Values represent means Â± standard errors. Means in the same row accompanied by different letters are significantly different between treatments at LSD = 0.05, n = 4 per experimental replicate. Natural soap acronyms: BB = base bar (control), FG = forest grove, H = hibiscus rose hip, FGA = forest grove + essential oils and green clay, HA = hibiscus + essential oils and pink clay, BBR = base bar + rosemary, FGR = Forest grove + rosemary, HR = hibiscus + rosemary, HOS = hydrophilic oxidant status, LOS = lipophilic oxidant status, TOS = total oxidant status, HPC = hydrophilic phenolic content, LPC = lipophilic phenolic content, TPC = total phenolic content, HAA = hydrophilic antioxidant activity, LAA = lipophilic antioxidant activity, TAA = total antioxidant activity. </p>
