 <p> Principal component analysis showing the relationship between ( a) sensory/perceptual attributes, phenolic content, oxidation status and antioxidant activity values; together with ( b) the unsaponified fatty acid composition of commercial natural soaps manufactured using cold saponification. HOS = hydrophilic oxidant status, LOS = lipophilic oxidant status, TOS = total oxidant status, HPC = hydrophilic phenolic content, LPC = lipophilic phenolic content, TPC = total phenolic content, HAA = hydrophilic antioxidant activity, LAA = lipophilic antioxidant activity, TAA = total antioxidant activity. SFA = saturated fatty acids, PUFA = polyunsaturated fatty acids, SSFA = short chain saturated fatty acids (C8–C12), M-LSFA = medium/long chain saturated fatty acids (C14:0–C18:0). </p>
