 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Numerous studies have reported the health functions of fish oils (FOs) and their components such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important for maintaining healthy cells and hormone levels. N-6 fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid, were shown to stimulate inflammatory processes by stimulating the flux of inflammatory pro-inflammatory type-2 prostaglandins and type-4 leukotrienes [
