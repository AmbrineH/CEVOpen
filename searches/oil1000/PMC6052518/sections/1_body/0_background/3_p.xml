<p id="Par16" class="p">KOs are abundant in n-3 fatty acids, phospholipids, and various antioxidants that are generally different from those in FOs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Fatty acids in FO mainly include triglycerides, while in KOs, 30–65% of fatty acids are present as phospholipids, the main component of the cell membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Binding between phospholipids and n-3 fatty acids greatly promotes the passage of molecules through the intestinal wall, increasing absorption rates and ultimately improving n-3: n-6 fatty acid ratios [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. These KOs not only confer various functions, but also have high bioavailability, so small amounts of KOs still exhibit positive functions. The demand for functional materials or functional foods for treating various geriatric diseases that occur with aging is currently increasing. Particularly, it is urgent to search for and develop functional materials for senile dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Studies of phosphatidylserine having n-3 PUFAs revealed improvement in cerebellum and cerebral cortex function in the elderly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, studies of the bioavailability of KOs are limited, particularly the bioavailability of KOs in the blood and brain.
