<p id="Par25" class="p">We also investigated the composition of saturated fatty acid (SFA), MUFA, and PUFA in TG and PL of the oils (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). SFA and MUFA in TG of FO were significantly lower than in KO and CKO. In contrast, PUFA in TG of FO was the highest at 99.22%. Fatty acids in PL of FO was not detected, but fatty acids in PL of KO and CKO was detected. KO showed a higher MUFA content than CKO, and CKO showed a higher PUFA content.
