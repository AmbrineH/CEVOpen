<p id="Par28" class="p">The results of analysis of brain EPA and DHA after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. EPA and DHA contents gradually increased over time, whereas FO showed the highest level at 2 h and decreased slowly after oral administration of KO and CKO. Regardless of the type of oil, MUFA and PUFA increased over time (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Notably, although the total UFS content of the KOs was lower than the total UFS content of the FO, the remaining UFS content was higher than that of the FO over time. Studies of the relative oral bioavailability of n-3 supplements have shown controversial results, and several studies reported that phospholipid form (krill) is better absorbed than ethyl ester or TG type FO [
