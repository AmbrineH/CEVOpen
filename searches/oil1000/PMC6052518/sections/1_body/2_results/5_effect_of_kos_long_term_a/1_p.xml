<p id="Par29" class="p">Changes in EPA and DHA contents during 2 weeks of oral administration of oils are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. The contents of EPA and DHA in the blood of FO, KO, and CKO were highest in CKO (15.71 and 13.75 μg/mg) at 1 week. FO showed higher EPA contents (11.86 μg/mg) than KO and CKO after 2 weeks. There was no significant difference in DHA content between FO, KO, and CKO after oral administration for 2 weeks. The changes in TG and PL contents in the blood after oral administration of FO, KO, and CKO for 1 and 2 weeks showed that KOs were slightly higher than FO, but the difference was not significant. These tendencies were similar in the brain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). CKO decreased gradually as the period of administration increased, whereas the content of FO and KO was initially low, but the absorption rate was higher following continuous consumption. However, there were no significant differences between groups. The amount of EPA and DHA in the brain was slightly higher in KOs than in the long-term administration period, but there was no significant difference. The results are also shown in Table
