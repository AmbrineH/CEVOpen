<p id="Par24" class="p">To investigate the bioavailability of KOs, we analyzed TG and PLs in KOs by TLC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Perilla oil and FO were used as standard samples. In addition, the fatty acid compositions of TG and PLs were analyzed (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Because KOs have a high PL content, they were compared with perilla and FOs. PL was not detected in FO and perilla oil, but was detected in both types of KOs. TG was detected in all oils, but was most abundant in FO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). These results reveal the differences between FO and KOs. Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> show the results of fatty acid analysis after oil was eluted by scraping TG and PL spots separated from FO and KOs. For the fatty acid composition of TG in fish and KOs, myristic acid (14:0) and palmitic acid (16:0), which are animal fatty were, showed significantly higher in KOs than FO (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In addition, UFSs such as oleic acid (18:1, n-9), vaccenic acid (18:1, n-7), linoleic acid (18:2, n-6), gamma linoleic acid (18:3, n-3), stearidonic acid (18:4, n-3), and gadoleic acid (20:1, n-9) were significantly higher in KOs than FO. In contrast, the content of EPA and DHA in FO was more than 2-fold higher. Mysteric acid and palmitic acid were 15.13 and 23.47% in KOs, respectively, which are similar to the values reported by Gigliotti et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. In contrast, palmitoleic acid and oleic acid were lower in our KOs than the contents described previously. This may be because of differences in the treatment with oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> shows the fatty acid composition in PL in FO and KOs. FO contained no PL, but the fatty acid composition in the PL of KOs was found. Particularly, two KOs showed high contents of EPA and DHA in PL. The EPA content of CKO was 41.13% and EPA content of KO was 32.49%. The EPA content of CKO was significantly higher than that of KO. However, the content of DHA was 19.76% for KO and 15.81% for CKO, indicating that the content in KO was significantly higher.
