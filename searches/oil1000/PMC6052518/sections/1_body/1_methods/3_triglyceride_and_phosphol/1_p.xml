<p id="Par20" class="p">Triglyceride (TG) and phospholipid analysis (PL) was conducted by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. To detect TG and PL, 30 mg of sample dissolved in chloroform was placed on a TLC silica gel plate (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and 100 μL of samples were loaded. The development solvent contained chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, water (75: 40: 8: 3). After loading, the TLC plate was dried, and then 0.2% 2,7-dichlorofluorescein reagent (in 95% methanol) was sprayed onto the TLC plate. TG and PL were identified using a UV detector. Bands corresponding to TG and PL were scraped off and methylated with 14% BF
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in methanol. The resulting fatty acid methyl ester was analyzed by gas chromatography [
