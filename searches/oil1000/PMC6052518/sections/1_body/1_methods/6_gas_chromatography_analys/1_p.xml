<p id="Par23" class="p">A gas chromatograph (Varian 3800; Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA) fitted with a Supelcowax 10 fused-silica capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm id., 0.25 μm film thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and flame ionization detector were used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Initially, the column was maintained at 180 °C for 1 min and then increased to 230 °C at a rate of 1.5 °C/min. The temperature was then held at 230 °C for 10 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a split ratio of 50:1. The injector and detector temperatures were 240 °C and 250 °C, respectively. Fatty acid methyl esters were verified against the retention times of known standards.
