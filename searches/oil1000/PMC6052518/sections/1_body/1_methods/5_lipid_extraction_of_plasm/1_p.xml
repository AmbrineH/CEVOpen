 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. Lipid in 1 mL of plasma and brain were extracted in 4 mL of chloroform: methanol = 2:1 mixture. Ten micrograms of heptadecanoic acid were added as an internal standard. The supernatant was removed by nitrogen purging. After acid hydrolysis using 8.3 M HCl, methylation was carried out and the hexane layer was analyzed by gas chromatography.
