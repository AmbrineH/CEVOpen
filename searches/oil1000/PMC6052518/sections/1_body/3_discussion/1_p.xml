<p id="Par30" class="p">Our results of TG and PLs in oils are similar to those reported in other studies; because PL and TG require different digestive enzymes, the bioavailability and tissue attachment of n-3 PUFA may differ. In turn, this can lead to other physiological and health effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Thus, EPA and DHA esterified with PLA in KOs may greatly impact human health. However, it is unusual to preferentially esterify EPA and DHA with PL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. The composition of saturated fatty acid (SFA), MUFA, and PUFA in TG and PL of the oils (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) were investigated. Fatty acids were not detected in PL of FO but fatty acids were detected in PL of KO and CKO. KO showed higher MUFA content than CKO, and CKO showed higher PUFA content. These results indicate that the bioavailability of UFA, which is relatively high in TG of FO, and UFA, and are abundant in PL of KOs. In result of short-term administration on blood fatty acid composition, the absorption rate of PL in the blood was highest in CKO. FO showed a similar tendency to KO but had the lowest value. The absorption rate of n-3 fatty acids is affected by the chemical form and an excellent absorption rate for PL-bound n-3 fatty acids in KOs has been suggested [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. Considering that PL was not detected in the FO sample, our results are reasonable. EPA and DHA contents gradually increased over time, whereas FO showed the highest level at 2Â h and decreased slowly after oral administration of KO and CKO in brain. Regardless of the type of oil, MUFA and PUFA increased over time (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). DHA is particularly concentrated in the brain, nervous tissue, and retina and is essential for normal neurological function. Deficiency of DHA is associated with many neurological disorders DHA absorption is greater when it is delivered by liposomes than by oil. This was demonstrated by an increase in the DHA ratio in both lymphatic triacylglycerol and PL delivered by liposomes compared to by the FO diet [
