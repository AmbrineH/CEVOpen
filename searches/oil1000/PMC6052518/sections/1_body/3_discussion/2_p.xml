<p id="Par31" class="p">The brain exclusively consumes DHA in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Recent studies showed that in the blood brain barrier (Mfsd2a), the carrier transports LPC-DHA, but not DHA. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the level of LPC-DHA in the plasma to efficiently concentrate DHA in the brain [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. The exact mechanism of KOs is not clear. However, the unique biomolecular profile of KOs has demonstrates the possibility of erosion of n-3 (EPA/DHA) fatty acids in PLs and distinguishes KOs from FO. Also, the contents of EPA and DHA in the blood of FO, KO, and CKO were highest in CKO at 1 week. FO showed higher EPA contents than KO and CKO after 2 weeks. There was no significant difference in DHA content between FO, KO, and CKO after oral administration for 2 weeks. The changes in TG and PL contents in the blood after oral administration of FO, KO, and CKO for 1 and 2 weeks showed that KOs were slightly higher than FO, but the difference was not significant. These tendencies were similar in the brain.
