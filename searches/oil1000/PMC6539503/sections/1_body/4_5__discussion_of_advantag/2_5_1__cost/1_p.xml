<p class="p">The price for a MPFM can vary between 100,000–500,000 US dollars, depending on the requirements for the meter [
 <xref rid="B42-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The prices will vary depending on whether the MPFM is installed on- or offshore or if the location is topside or subsea. The operational cost for a MPFM is around 10,000–40,000 US dollars per year. This is a huge saving compared to the conventional test separator, which has an operational cost around 350,000 US dollars per year [
 <xref rid="B42-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. It is clear that VFMs are much cheaper compared to other MPFMs, as they only consist of measurements based on simple conventional field instruments and empirical algorithms.
