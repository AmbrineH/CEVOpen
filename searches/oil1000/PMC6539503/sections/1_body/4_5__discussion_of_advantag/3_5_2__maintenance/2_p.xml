<p class="p">Pressure and temperature sensors are installed so that they can easily be adjusted or replaced by new sensors, which makes maintenance more doable. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02184-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, a sensor is measuring either the pressure or temperature on a fluid flowing inside a pipe. The valve can easily be shut down without any interruption of the fluid, and the sensor can be replaced without a complete shut down of the oil production. If the MPFM receives the mass flow and density distribution from a coriolis, the maintenance and replacement can cause more difficulties [

 <xref rid="B161-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>]. Even though the coriolis is suppose to have lower maintenance due to no moving parts, it can still cause problems. The coriolis is installed inline of the pipe as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02184-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>, and maintenance such as replacement of the coriolis will require a complete shutdown of the production.
