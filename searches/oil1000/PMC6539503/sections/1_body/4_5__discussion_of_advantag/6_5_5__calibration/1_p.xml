<p class="p">For the MPFM to operate, it needs calibration in the form of input data from time to time. Especially VFMs will need much calibration before start-up to estimate and produce the empirical equations for the software. Contrary to this other MPFM will only need calibration when the accuracy of the data is drifting over time. PT-sensors have a long-term stability and are calibrated with respect to the electric signal from the sensor. Over the time a PT-sensor will drift from the initial zero point offset. By calibration, the zero point offset can be re-adjusted increasing the accuracy. Pressure calibration is done by venting the sensor with ambient air and hereby trimming the offset, so that the zero point is again matching [

 <xref rid="B121-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. For a given period stated by the manufacturer, the radioactive source must be calibrated to take account for the loss of intensity of the source. If the half-life time is short, the calibration needs to be performed more frequently compared to a radioactive source with a longer half-life time. The calibration is done by measuring the count-rates of the radiation with respect to each single phase [
