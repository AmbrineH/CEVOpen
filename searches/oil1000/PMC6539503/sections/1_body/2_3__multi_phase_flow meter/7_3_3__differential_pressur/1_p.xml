<p class="p">Many multi-phase flow meters use differential pressure (DP) transmitters to measure the difference in the pressure in two given points inside the pipe. The most common differential pressure transmitters used in the offshore industry are an orifice plate or a venturi meter, due to their accuracy, in-line measurements and small footprint. Using Bernoulliâ€™s principle it is known that increasing the velocity of the fluid will cause a decrease in the pressure. By obtaining the differential pressure, the flow rate of the fluid can be calculated [

 <xref rid="B125-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. Both the orifice plate and the venturi meter creates a disturbance to the flow which enables the DP transmitters to measure the pressure difference between two points. Together with a software tool consisting of empirical algorithms, some DP meters can provide multi-phase flow measurement with the same accuracy as tomography based meters or gamma densitometers. These meters are called virtual flow meters (VFM) and with the simple instrumental equipment, these meters can contribute to a cheaper solution for the offshore industry [
 <xref rid="B126-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. The meter consist only of an orifice plate or a venturi meter and already available measurements at offshore installations such as temperature and pressure transmitters. The main limitation of the meter is that the fluid composition must be constant. To avoid this problem void fraction sensors and gamma densitometers are combined with the VFM measurements.
