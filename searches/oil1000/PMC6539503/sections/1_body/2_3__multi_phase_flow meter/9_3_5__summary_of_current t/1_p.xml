 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-sensors-19-02184" class="xref">Section 3.4</xref> has outlined some of the current technologies for multi-phase flow measurements. Based on the investigation and experimental results especially ERT, EIT and gamma densitometry have shown promising and reliable results based on the accuracy of the presented prototypes. All of the presented prototypes are listed in 
 <xref rid="sensors-19-02184-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> for a better overview. Though, the prototypes has been widely tested, further investigations should be done before application of the prototypes for industrial use in e.g., the offshore industry. The prototypes with the poorest accuracy is the VFMs by [
