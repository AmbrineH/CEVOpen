<p class="p">ERT is contrary to ECT applied when the continuous phase is conducting [
 <xref rid="B56-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. It can be a challenge that the continuous phase needs to be conducting, since the phases can vary e.g., during a slug cycle. During a slug cycle the gas volume fraction (GVF) can vary from 0â€“100% and the continuous phase is hereby not guaranteed to be conducting at all times. ERT has also been widely described and investigated [
