<p class="p">One issue regarding ECT is the imaging reconstruction algorithm, which induces an inverse problem. Different approximation methods have been used to solve the inverse problem and linear back projection (LBP) is commonly used. Reference [
 <xref rid="B81-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] has developed a new reconstruction algorithm, which they claim is able to image two- and three-phase flows. The algorithm is based on an analog neural network multi-criteria optimization image reconstruction technique and shows both accurate, consistent and robust results. The algorithm works for transient multi-phase phenomena in gas-liquid and gas-liquid-solid flows. Some non-commercial ECT techniques have been proposed, where [
 <xref rid="B82-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] presents a void fraction measurement system for two-phase flow. The measurement error of the system is less than 5%, and the method is suitable for the void fraction measurement of bubble flow, stratified flow, wavy flow, slug flow, and annular flow. Another promising non-commercial technique is presented in [
 <xref rid="B83-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. The prototype is a multi-phase flow meter for oil-continuous flows. The technique is an improved AC-based ECT system and it shows less than 3% absolute error for oil-water flows with a water liquid ratio (WLR) &lt; 35%.
