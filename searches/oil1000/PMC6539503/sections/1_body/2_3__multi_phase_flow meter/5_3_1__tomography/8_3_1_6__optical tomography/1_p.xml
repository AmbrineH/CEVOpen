<p class="p">Optical tomography uses illumination such as absorption, diffraction and reflection of light as a method to measure the multi-phase flow within a cross-section of a pipe [

 <xref rid="B110-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. The main component of an optic sensor is a light source and a camera to sense the reflected light. Since the sensor is measuring the transparency of the flow inside the pipe with respect to absorbed and reflected light, the sensor needs a transparent window inside the pipe in order to be able to detect the light [
 <xref rid="B111-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. Another disadvantages regarding optical tomography is that in multi-component flow such as multi-phase flows, a bubble of e.g., air/gas can cause misleading measurements. This is due to the curving and reflecting surface of the bubble, which can cause an intense beam of light to be reflected within the flow and hereby confuse the camera of the optic sensor [

 <xref rid="B112-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>], where the sensor is investigated for both single and two-phase pipe flows. The sensor shows accurate measurements but are limited to flow situations with up to 15% gas fraction. The lack of ability to measure the gas fraction in the entire range makes the optical tomography not suitable for monitoring of multi-phase flow in the oil and gas industry.
