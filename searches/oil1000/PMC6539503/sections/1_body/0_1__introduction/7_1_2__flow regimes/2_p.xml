The latter can be difficult to monitor and prevent, and requires an accurate feedback system with reliable measurements, in order to prevent slugging from occurring inside the pipes. The input for the feedback system can e.g., be multi-phase flow or pressure measurements. It is proven that flow measurements are a better control variable compared to e.g., pressure, as long as the flow measurements are accurate. The effectiveness of a cascade controller, which is i.a. based on flow measurements, is presented in [
