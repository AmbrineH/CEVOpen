 <xref rid="B24-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The regulations are stated by The Danish Environmental Protection Agency based on requirements from OSPAR Commission, which protects the marine environment and biodiversity in the North-East Atlantic Ocean [

The amount of dispersed oil in PW can carefully be monitored and hereby reduced by the implementation of e.g., MPFMs, as they can optimize the separation process and chemical injection. In the permissions provided by The Danish Environmental Protection Agency given from 2019 to 2023 it can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02184-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> that the amount of PW and discharged dispersed oil is increasing with exception of some years due to shut down of big platforms (reconstruction of Tyra field in 2019â€“2022 [

 <xref rid="B27-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]). The increase of PW is a result of maturing fields with increasing water cut. This is supporting the importance of accurate measurements of the multi-phase flow and, hereby, the necessity of MPFMs. The increase in PW can also be a huge problem, if the legal requirements are not adjusted to this change, as it will be difficult to respect the given law. The data from
