<p class="p">One major problem in the offshore oil and gas industry is monitoring of multi-phase flow consisting of oil, water and gas in pipelines [

 <xref rid="B2-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Due to difficulties regarding subsurface instrumentation the multi-phase flow contributes to a huge problem at offshore installations [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02184-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a typical offshore installation of a well-pipeline-riser system is illustrated. As it can be seen from the figure, most of the process is placed subsurface, which enhances the problem. For vertical wells as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02184-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> the system consists of three main sections being the vertical pipe from the reservoir to the seabed, the horizontal subsea pipeline, and the vertical riser-pipeline from the seabed to the separation platform [
 <xref rid="B5-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Since subsea instrumentation is extremely expensive and cumbersome, monitoring of the multi-phase flow is often reduced to the top of the vertical riser-pipeline and following pipelines, which is located above sea.
