<p class="p">In the gravity separator the three phases will start separating right after entering the gravity separator. Small impurities from the well and corrosion inhibitors added to the flow can lead to the presence of foam between the oil and gas mixture [

 <xref rid="B48-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In addition to the foam between the oil and gas phases there will also occur an emulsion layer between the oil and water phases. The thickness of the emulsion layer depends on i.a. the residence time inside the gravity separator [
 <xref rid="B48-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Both the foam and emulsion layer has a negative impact of the separation process and hereby the total oil recovery [
 <xref rid="B16-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Chemicals are added to prevent the foam and thick emulsion layer inside the separator. The amount of chemicals added depends on the composition of the fluid, and accurate measurements of the multi-phase flow are hereby essential. The chemical injection is a very expensive process and unnecessary injection will only lead to poor oil quality and unnecessary expenses [
 <xref rid="B49-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Hence, the need for measurement of all three phases prior separation is necessary. Another way to prevent a thick emulsion layer between the oil and water is electrostatic coalescence, which has been described in [

 <xref rid="B53-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. In the presence of slug flow conditions as explained in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1dot2-sensors-19-02184" class="xref">Section 1.2</xref>, the multi-phase flow has the impact of increasing the protective surface scales/films inside the pipeline. This can eventually increase the corrosion rate since the slug flow will lead to higher fluctuations of the surface shear stress [
 <xref rid="B54-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Each problems can be prevented by obtaining correct measurements of the multi-phase flow, which will be an input in a feed-back system. Reliable and accurate equipment is essential to monitor the multi-phase flow and hereby to improve the overall oil recovery.
