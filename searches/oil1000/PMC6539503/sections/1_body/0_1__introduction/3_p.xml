<p class="p">Although the focus of this review paper is multi-phase flow in the upstream transportation pipelines, the flow measurement is also of importance to other parts of the oil recovery process. Tthe produced water (PW) treatment is affected by accurate and reliable measurements of the flow. PW treatment is a product from the separation process, which occurs after
