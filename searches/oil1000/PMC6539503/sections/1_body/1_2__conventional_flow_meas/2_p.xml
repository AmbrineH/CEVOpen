<p class="p">Inside the test separator the multi-phase flow is separated into three different single-phase flows. After each outlet of respectively oil, gas and water a single-phase flow meter is installed labeled as FM on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-02184-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. The conventional method with the test separator is reliable and accurate but not suitable for real-time monitoring of the multi-phase flow, as the process is simply too slow [
 <xref rid="B30-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. It takes time for the three phases to divide inside the separator, which means that the single-phase output will not provide instantaneous and real-time measurements [
 <xref rid="B59-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Since the measurements are not in real-time it can not be used in a feedback system to prevent e.g., slugging or overdosage of chemical injection. Other disadvantages regarding the conventional technology is that the test separator has a huge footprint and contributes to extra load on the given platform [
 <xref rid="B42-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Also the measurements are not performed in-line [
 <xref rid="B59-sensors-19-02184" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Due to these disadvantages regarding the conventional test separator, new technologies and instruments have been investigated and implemented for commercial use. The upcoming sections will cover the new technologies to measure the multi-phase flow.
