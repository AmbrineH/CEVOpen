<p class="p">From the table it can be seen that the presented MPFMs with a radioactive source tends to have a better accuracy compared to the MPFMs with no radioactive source. The MPFMs provided by Emerson (Roxar) 2600 M and 2600 MG contains no radioactive source and has a poor accuracy compared to the other MPFMs. Also the MPFM provided by Khrone Oil &amp; Gas contains no radioactive source and has a poor accuracy especially for the gas rate. Based on the data sheets the most accurate MPFMs from the table are the meters provided by Schlumberger, Weatherford and Pietro Fiorentini (Flowatch HS). The three meters all contain a radioactive source and is claimed to operate in the entire range (0–100% WLR, 0–100% GVF ).</p>
