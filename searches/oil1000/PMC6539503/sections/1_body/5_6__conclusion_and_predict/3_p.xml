<p class="p">The number of MPFMs and investigations of accurate and intelligent technologies of multi-phase flow measurement are expected to continuously increase and expand in the coming years because of maturing fields and the focus upon continuous oil production. The overall issue is to design a commercial solution, which can accurately measure the entire GVF and provide accurate and real-time measurements. This should be without compromising safety and the footprint on the respective platform. Other essential qualities for future MPFMs are low maintenance, availability and easy operation. A possible solution could therefore, be further investigation of VFMs, as this has the potential to fulfill the qualities for accurate and reliable multi-phase flow measurements. Eventually VFMs could be combined with e.g., tomography technologies in sensor fusion to obtain even more accurate and reliable meters.</p>
