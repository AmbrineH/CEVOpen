<p class="p">This review article has presented and discussed the newest trends in the offshore oil and gas industry with respect to multi-phase flow measurements. As stated in this article, the accuracy and reliability of multi-phase flow measurements are essential for allocated production data and model prediction. The value of MPFMs can be of great importance over the entire lifetime of a field, but especially as mature fields turn into brown fields over the production life of the field. Hence, it is essential to monitor production and stage of each well as this can estimate the lifetime and future development of a field. In the latter years of the production life of a well, the focus of production is increasing rather than the exploration of the well. For mature wells, it is extremely important to accurately measure the multi-phase flow, as the water cut will increase and the reservoir pressure will decrease.</p>
