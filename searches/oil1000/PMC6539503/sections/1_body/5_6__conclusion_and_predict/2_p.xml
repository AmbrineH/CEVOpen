<p class="p">Tomography and gamma-ray densitometry have been widely investigated, and commercial meters have been developed. The technologies have been further developed, and some new and promising solutions and prototypes have been tested. Some of the prototypes show measurement errors of less than 0.53%. Commercial MPFMs where illustrated and discussed as well. The most accurate MPFM is a gamma densitometer based on experiments of the prototypes and data sheets of the commercial products. Even though gamma densitometers have the greatest overall accuracy and are able to measure the flow independent of the composition of the phases, the radioactive source is often a considerable limitation. Maintenance and calibration of a radioactive source requires special demands and safety to respect the law. A MPFM solution without a radioactive source is therefore, preferred. Sensor fusion-based DP meters with a software tool (VFM) have also shown progress in recent years. This method is to be preferred in most cases, as this is non-intrusive, non-radioactive and cheap compared to other MPFM technologies. Although the accuracy of VFMs is not as great as gamma densitometers, the solution should be greatly considered due to less maintenance requirements and price.</p>
