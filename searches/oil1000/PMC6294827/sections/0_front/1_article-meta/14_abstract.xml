 <p id="Par1" class="p">Repellents are a main tool to prevent the outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases that represents a threat for millions of people worldwide. Plant-based products are very promising, low-toxic and eco-friendly alternative to synthetic repellents. Here, we performed an olfactory screening of the essential oils (EOs) of 
  <italic class="italic">Artemisia verlotiorum</italic> Lamotte (Asteraceae), 
  <italic class="italic">Lavandula dentata</italic> L. (Lamiaceae), and 
  <italic class="italic">Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. (Rutaceae) for their possible use as ingredients in topical repellents. The EOs smell profiles were then matched with their repellence against the mosquito 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse) (Diptera Culicidae). To obtain a more complete bioactivity description, we also tested the EOs oviposition deterrence and the larvicidal activity. The best smell profile was associated with 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">verlotiorum</italic> EO, while 
  <italic class="italic">R</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">chalepensis</italic> EO showed the lowest overall pleasantness. All the EOs had a significant activity as skin repellent against 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic>, deterred the oviposition in the field, and exerted a clear larvicidal activity. Beside the best smell profile, 
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">verlotiorum</italic> EO showed also the longest lasting repellent effect, assuring the complete protection of the treated skin against 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic> for a time 60% longer than the synthetic repellent DEET.
