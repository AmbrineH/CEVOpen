<p id="Par10" class="p">The 96.38% of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">verlotiorum</italic> was composed by 39 compounds, belonging to the monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids and other non-terpene derivatives chemical classes. As in 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dentata</italic> EO, but with an almost halved relative concentration, the most abundant chemical class of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">verlotiorum</italic> EO was represented by monoterpene hydrocarbons. Accounting for up to 34.27%, chrysanthenone was the most represented compound of this class and of the entire EO composition, followed by 1,8-cineole (7.10%). The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons followed: this chemical class was mainly represented by β-caryophyllene (12.62%, the second most abundant compound in the total EO) and γ-muurolene (9.90%). In this EO, monoterpene hydrocarbons showed an almost halved (4.17%) relative abundance compared to 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dentata</italic> EO, with myrcene (1.89%) and α-pinene (1.19%) as the most represented ones.
