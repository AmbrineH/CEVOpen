<p id="Par4" class="p">Because of their properties, EOs have been proposed as active ingredients in mosquito-repellent topical products

 </sup>. However, despite their efficacy, low cost and low toxicity, EOs still do not have a widespread application due to some limitations such as their high volatility, composition variability and strong smell. In fact, the sensory impact of EOs has been reported as one of the most negative aspects of their use

 </sup>. To that regard, to ensure market success as ingredient in EOs-based environmental and topical repellents, EOs should have a high efficacy against the target insect coupled with a pleasant smell for the consumers.Â To date, however, no specific investigations have been performed to evaluate their bioactivity against the target insects and their impact on human sensorial system.
