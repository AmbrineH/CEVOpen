<p id="Par15" class="p">Personal protection by mosquito repellents is a key measure for the control of several life-threatening vector-borne diseases and synthetic compounds (i.e. DEET, DEPA, IR3535, and Picaridin) are commonly used as active ingredient in insect repellent products

 </sup>. However, an increasing number of evidences suggest that such synthetic repellents may trigger undesirable hazardous interactions with biological systems, with a potential to generate harmful effects

 </sup>. Nonetheless, for their use as active ingredients in topical or environmental spray products, EOs should not only be persistent and effective against mosquitoes but they also should be sensorially well accepted by consumers. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies coupling the bioactivity of the EOs against insects and their sensory impact on customers. In fact, the sensory impact of EOs has been reported as one of the most negative aspects of their use
