 <italic class="italic">chalepensis</italic> EOs, showing anti-mosquito properties similar or higher than DEET, appear as viable alternative to synthetic repellents. Unlike DEET, EOs based products may be well accepted by the public due to the increasing consumer demand for effective and safe, natural products. More significantly, considering the sensory quality parameters of EOs, the possibility of theirÂ use can be expanded by incorporating EOs in sprays, creams, lotions and aerosols based anti-mosquito formulations. The good protection time currently observed can be further increased by polymer encapsulation
