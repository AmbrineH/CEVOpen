<p id="Par17" class="p">The panel test identified 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">verlotiorum</italic> EO as the most pleasant-smelling one. The significant relative abundance of chrysanthenone in its composition is probably the reason of its panellists’ preference: Lawrence
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup> described it as a slightly oily-floral aroma suitable for aromatic industry. Together with 1,8-cineole and β-caryophyllene, it may be responsible for the vegetal fresh odour described by the panel
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. Chrysanthenone, indeed, has been reported as a strong but very pleasant smell contributor in the EO of another species of the same genus (
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">herba-alba</italic>) by Rekkab 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>. This oxygenated monoterpene aroma contribution has also been described as a sweet, floral scent in the EOs extracted from two other species of the Compositae family: 
 <italic class="italic">Laggera tomentosa</italic> Sch. Bip. ex Oliv. et Hiern (Asteraceae) and 
 <italic class="italic">Otanthus maritimus</italic> (L.) Hoffmanns. &amp; Link (Asteraceae)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. A relevant contribution to 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">verlotiorum</italic> EO aroma is also that of β-caryophyllene, which is commonly referred to as a “green” flavour contribution: its woody-spicy, dry and clove-like aroma is responsible for the aroma of leafy green vegetables
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. In our tests, the 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">verlotiorum</italic> EO pleasantness score was closely followed by 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dentata</italic> EO, characterized by “Medicinal and Fresh paint” off-flavours that could be explained by the presence of camphor and fenchone as main chemical components. These compounds can, indeed, be associated with an intense pharmaceutical and chemical odour. In the 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">dentata</italic> EO, the well-known warm, minty and ethereal aroma of camphor is coupled with the fenchone contribution

 </sup>. This oxygenated monoterpene has a powerful balsamic, almost pine-like, and spicy notes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. On the contrary, the unpleasantness of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">chalepensis</italic> EO may due to the presence of 2-nonanone, a non-terpene derivative which determines a characteristic rue odour. Its strong fatty smell, with a very low odour threshold, is one of the most important contributors to soft mould-ripened cheeses and Blue cheese aromas
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. The closely-related ester, 2-nonyl acetate, exhibits a “fruitier” but unpleasant nuance, involved in the smell of ripening banana. It is, therefore, not advisable to use it in topic formulations, as its odour is strong and unpleasant
