For each treatment, four ovitraps filled with 500 mL of EOs solution were paired with four control pots containing Tween 80 0.1% solution only and each pair was separated by 5 m. A Masonite strip (200 × 25 mm) was placed in each pot. The Masonite strips were removed daily for fourteen days and

 <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic> eggs were counted under a stereo microscope. The oviposition activity was expressed as oviposition activity index (OAI): OAI = (NT − NC)/(NT + NC), where NT is the total number of eggs in the test solution and NC is the total number of eggs in the control solution. Positive values (OAI &gt; + 0.3) indicate that the test solutions were attractive. Conversely, negative values (OAI &lt; − 0.3) indicate that the test solutions were deterrent
