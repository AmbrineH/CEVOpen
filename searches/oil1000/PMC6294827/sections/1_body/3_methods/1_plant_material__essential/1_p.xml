Plant species were selected among those with floral smell essential oils, the most suitable, in our opinion, to be proposed for the formulation of topical products. In addition, the selected plants are available in many countries with remarkable abundance so their future use in dermatological products seems feasible. Plants were collected at the flowering stage in May 2016, air-dried in the shadow at room temperature, ground and then subjected to hydro-distillation for 2 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus. EOs were collected over water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored at 5 °C until analysis. The gas chromatography (GC) analyses were performed as described by Bedini
