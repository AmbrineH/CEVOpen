 <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic> originated from field-collected eggs. For eggs hatching, the Masonite strips were collected daily and placed in 250 mL beakers submerged in tap water under room conditions (26 ± 2 °C, 60% rh, photoperiod of 14:10 h (L:D). For larvicidal treatments, newly emerged larvae were fed with a small amount of cat food until fourth instar. For repellence tests, pupae were then placed in Plexiglas cylindrical cages (diameter 35 cm, length 60 cm) with a cotton stockinet access sleeve on the front. Emerged adults, were maintained (about 300 individuals per cage, sex ratio 1:1) under laboratory conditions, and supplied with 10% sucrose solution.
