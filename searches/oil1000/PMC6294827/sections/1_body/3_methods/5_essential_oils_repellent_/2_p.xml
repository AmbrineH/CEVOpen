 </sup> procedure, with few modifications. Four cages, as above descripted, were assigned to each participant, chosen as above descripted, and randomly used for the experiment. The randomized use of the cages was meant to reduce any bias associated with using only one cage and to prevent accumulation of repellent on or around the single cage, which may bias the evaluation of the effectiveness of the repellents. The experiment was performed as above descripted at the doses of 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.08 μL cm

The lasting of the protection from mosquito bites (complete protection time, CPT), was calculated as the time between the application of the repellent and the first of two consecutive mosquito probing attempts. The lasting of the residual protection effect (residual protection time, RPT) was calculated as the time until no more differences in the number of probing were observed between the treated and the control hand. Data used to calculate the protection time were recorded by two observers. 100 μL of 1%
