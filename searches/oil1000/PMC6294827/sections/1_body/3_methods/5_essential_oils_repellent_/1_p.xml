 </sup> with some modifications. Experiments were conducted during the summer of 2017 in the above descripted cages, containing about of 150 field-derived, 8–12 days old females starved for 12 h that had not yet been either blood fed or exposed to any form of repellent. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Pisa (Comitato Bioetico dell’Università di Pisa) and all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All volunteers provided written informed consent. Ten volunteers were chosen among subjects not allergic to mosquito bites. The volunteers had no contact with perfumed products on the day of the bioassay. After cleaning their hands in distilled water, their forearms were protected with a thick fabric sleeve and the hands with latex gloves, in which a dorsal square area 5 × 5 cm was cut open. The mosquito-exposed skin of one hand was treated with 100 μL of ethanol as a negative control. The other hand was treated with 100 μL of EO ethanolic solution at concentrations varying from 0.00001 to 0.8 µL cm

Immediately after, the other hand was treated with the EO solution and, after about 5 min, exposed to mosquitoes in the same cage. The number of probing mosquitoes was recorded by two observers. On rare occasions, when no mosquito attempted to bite the untreated hand, the test was repeated with a new mosquito’s cage. The testing time was between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. in order to perform the test during the peak of the biting activity of the species
