<p id="Par33" class="p">Data of the assessments of the smell profiles of EOs and oviposition were processed by one-way ANOVA with the EO treatment as factor. Equality of variances was checked before the analyses by Levene’s test. Means were separated by Tukey’s b post-hoc test. 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was used as significance level of differences between means. OAI values were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test and means separated by pairwise comparison. The distribution of the time to mosquito-landing among EOs treatments and controls was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method by repeated-measures modelling, with time as a categorical variable. Significant differences between MCPT and MRPT values were determined by Breslow (Generalized Wilcoxon) test

 </sup>. EOs larvicidal activity was evaluated by Log-probit regression. Since no mortality was registered in the control treatment, the larval mortality percentage rates were not corrected. Analysis were performed by the SPSS 22.0 software (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, North Castle, New York, USA).
