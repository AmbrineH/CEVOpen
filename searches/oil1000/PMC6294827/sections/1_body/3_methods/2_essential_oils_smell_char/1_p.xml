<p id="Par27" class="p">The smell profiles of the essential oils were evaluated by a trained panel composed by 13 assessors (“expert panel” of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment (DAFE) of University of Pisa). All assessors had previous experience in sensory descriptive analysis

 </sup>. The assessors were provided with a specifically developed sensorial sheet consisting of a non-structured, parametric, descriptive scoring chart. The panellists described the main odours characterizing each sample on the basis of defined descriptors (see Tab. 7) ranked on a scale of 0–10 in terms of “Smell intensity”, “Smell persistency”, and “Overall pleasantness” and “Repulsion” as hedonic parameter

 </sup>. Assessors were also asked to provide indications about the possible use (Environmental or Body care) of the EOs. The blind smell test was performed in the morning, in a well-ventilated quiet room and in a relaxed atmosphere. Each panellist was provided with a 2 × 2 cm filter paper soaked with 50 µL of an unknown EO. To avoid cross contamination, the three samples were assessed separately in the same morning (15 minutes waiting between the assessing).
