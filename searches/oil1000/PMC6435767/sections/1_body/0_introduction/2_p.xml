<p id="Par27" class="p">Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of crude essential oils or their pure isolated compounds in the food and pharmaceutical industries, either as preservatives or antimicrobial agents (Herman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>; Prakash et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2012</xref>). They are being relied on as natural alternatives rather than the use of synthetic chemical agents; which cause multidrug resistance and several side effects. This is due to their constituents of bioactive compounds which possess both antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Essential oils of different 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species have demonstrated good antimicrobial effects against various bacteria including 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, Salmonella</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and fungi including 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> spp. (Bhat et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>). The oil is known to be rich in compounds with strong antimicrobial activity like thymol, carvacrol, Î³-terpinene, as well as

 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-sabinene hydrate (Didry et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sharifi-Rad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2018</xref>). Standardized reliable methods are essential for the elucidation of the antimicrobial activity and therapeutic potential of essential oils.
