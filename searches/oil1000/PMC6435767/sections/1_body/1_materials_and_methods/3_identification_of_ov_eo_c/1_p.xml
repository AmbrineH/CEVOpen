<p id="Par31" class="p">An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a RTX-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used for the GC–MS analysis of OV EO. The apparatus was coupled to an Agilent 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) mass selective detector. Initial oven temperature was kept at 40 °C for 2 min. Temperature was then raised at a rate of 5 °C/min till reaching 210 °C. Temperatures of both the injector and detector were adjusted at 290 and 300 °C, respectively. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. OV oil sample (0.1 μl) was injected manually in the split mode. Mass spectra were recorded in EI mode and 35–500 m/z range with ionization voltage, 70 eV. Ion source temperature was set at 230 °C. Kovat’s index was calculated for all compounds using a homologous series of

 <sub class="sub">5</sub>–C
 <sub class="sub">24</sub>) using the same operating conditions. Identification of different oil compounds was based on comparison of the obtained spectra with those available from MS libraries (Wiley) and by comparison of their experimentally determined Kovat’s index (KI) with those reported in the literature (Adams
