<p id="Par44" class="p">Each reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 4.9 ml aliquots of the OV EO emulsion having specified concentration with 100 µl of the microbial inoculum under test. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for specified time. It was then vortexed and 0.5 ml volumes were withdrawn and decimally diluted with saline. The numbers of surviving cells were determined by transferring 20 µl portions of each dilution onto the surface of over dried TSA or SDA plates and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h or at 25 °C for 2–5 days for the two media, respectively. The developed colonies were counted and average number of cells was calculated as CFU/ml. Control systems lacking the oil were also included.</p>
