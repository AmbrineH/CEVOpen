    <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> culture was heavily streaked onto TSA plate and incubated ate 37 °C for 5 days. The bacterial growth was scrapped off using sterile saline, vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 rpm. The pellet was suspended in sterile saline, vortexed and re-centrifuged. The resultant washed pellet was re-suspended in sterile saline and heated for 30 min in a water-bath at 80 °C to kill any vegetative cells. The resultant spore suspension was used as inoculum to study the dynamics of the biocidal activity of OV EO.

   <p id="Par38" class="p">Fungal spores: 
    <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> culture was grown as heavy streaks on SDA plate and incubated at 25 °C for 5 days. The developed spores were recovered using sterile saline containing 0.005% v/v Tween 20. The resultant spore suspension was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. The spore deposit was washed by dispersion in sterile saline-Tween, vortexed and re-centrifuged. The recovered washed spores were suspended in sterile saline-Tween and used as inoculum to study the biostatic activity of OV essential oil.
