<p id="Par40" class="p">Broth dilution method was performed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2012</xref>). Ten ml of stock OV EO emulsion (10% v/v) were twofold serially diluted with sterile distilled water. Each oil dilution was mixed with equal volume of double strength sterile TSB or SDB and inoculated with 100 µl/5 ml mixture of the test inoculum followed by thorough mixing. Cultures were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard which contains approximately 1 to 2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml with tested bacterial strains, then dilute the 0.5 McFarland suspension 1:10 in sterile broth or saline to obtain a concentration of 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/ml, the adjusted suspensions for final inoculation should be used within 15 min of preparation. One McFarland standard (equivalent to 1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/ml) is used for fungal strains. These systems were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and 25 °C for 48 h for bacteria and yeasts, respectively. Controls lacking the oil were also included. Visual inspection of the developed turbidity of the microbial growth was carried out and MIC of the oil was determined. Turbidity due to the oil emulsion was obvious only at ≥ 5.0% v/v. Average of 3 results was recorded.
