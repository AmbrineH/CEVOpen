<p id="Par39" class="p">Ten ml of stock OV EO emulsion (10% v/v) were twofold serially diluted with distilled water. Each of the oil dilution was thoroughly mixed with an equal volume of double-strength sterile molten TSA or SDA maintained at 50 °C in a water bath. Portions of the TSA-oil or SDA-oil were poured onto sterile petri dishes, allowed to solidify and left to dry at room temperature for 30 min. Ten microliter (ca 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/ml) aliquots of each of the prepared microbial inocula were transferred into the surface of the TSA-oil or SDA-oil plates as indicated. Inoculated TSA plates were than incubated for 24 h at 37 °C while the SDA plates were kept for 2–5 days at 25 °C. MIC of the oil was determined for each organism by visual inspection of the plates. MIC was considered as the lowest oil concentration giving no visible microbial growth; 1–2 colonies were neglected. Average of 3 results was recorded (Griffin et al.
