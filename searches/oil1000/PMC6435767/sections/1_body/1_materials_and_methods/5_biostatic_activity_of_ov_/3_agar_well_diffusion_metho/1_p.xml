<p id="Par41" class="p">Fifty ml portions of molten sterile TSA or SDA maintained at 50 °C were inoculated, each with 100 µl of properly diluted inoculum and mixed well. Inoculated medium was poured into sterile petri dish (ca.15 cm id.) and allowed to solidify. Wells, each of 6 mm diameters were removed leaving empty wells. These were 3/4 filled with the OV EO or 1% v/v OV EO emulsion. The plates were allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h and at 25 °C for 48 h in case of bacteria and yeast, respectively. The resultant inhibition zones were measured and the average values deduced (Balouiri et al.
