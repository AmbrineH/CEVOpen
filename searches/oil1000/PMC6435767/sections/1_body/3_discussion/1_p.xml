<p id="Par55" class="p">The essential oil composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> genus has been extensively studied, and has shown a wide variation between its different species. The variation in composition may even be present within the same species collected during different seasons or from different geographical areas. In the present study, GC/MS analysis of the hydro-distilled OV EO allowed the identification of 32 compounds representing 99.94% of the oil. The major identified compound was the oxygenated monoterpene; terpinen-4-ol. Terpinen-4-ol was also the major identified constituent of the OV EO grown in India, Israel and Venezuela (Govindarajan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2016</xref>; Ramos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2011</xref>; Ravid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">1987</xref>; Vera and Chane-Ming 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">1999</xref>). It is also a major constituent in the oil of other 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum</italic> species like 
 <italic class="italic">O. ramonese</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. scabrum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. microphyllum</italic> (Aligiannis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2001</xref>; Danin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">1997</xref>). Results of the biostatic studies on OV EO using agar and broth dilution methods showed that 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was the most sensitive organism to OV EO emulsion., with an MIC 0.125% v/v. Other studies also report a high sensitivity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> to OV EO with an MIC ranging 0.31–10 µg/ml (Honório et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>; Pesavento et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2015</xref>; Tavares et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2015</xref>). Agar diffusion method showed that the highest activity was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">Br. bronchiseptica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sac. cerevisiae, B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> with inhibition zones 38 ± 1.5, 29.5 ± 0.8, 26.9 ± 0.9 and 26.9 ± 1.1 mm, respectively. It should be also noted that the Gram negative 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was the least sensitive organism, as shown by the results obtained by all the used tests, while 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> was completely insensitive as shown by the broth dilution and agar diffusion methods. On the other side, study of the biocidal activity of OV EO emulsion using viable count technique showed that 75% of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> colonies died at a concentration of 0.09% v/v of the oil emulsion in only 5 min. This is supported by several studies that show a high activity of OV EO against different 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, especially vaginal and oral 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> (Bhat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2018</xref>; Cleff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2010</xref>). Studying the dynamics of 1% v/v OV EO emulsion over a period of 6 h revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli, B. subtilis, S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> had the fastest response, while all other organisms had more or less intermediate response except for 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> spores which were completely insensitive to the oil emulsion. This markedly strong antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the presence of the alcohol terpinene-4-ol in the EO. This compound has proven a strong antimicrobial activity against several organisms like 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium perfringens, E. faecalis, E. coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Ps. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (Carson and Riley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">1995</xref>; Hammer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2012</xref>; Mondello et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2006</xref>). Terpinen-4-ol is also the major compound present in tea tree oil which is known for its broad spectrum antimicrobial properties (Carson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2006</xref>; Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2013</xref>; Sharifi-Rad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2017</xref>). The suggested mechanism of action of terpinen-4-ol may be due to compromising of the cytoplasmic membrane (Carson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2002</xref>), or penetration of organelle membrane inducing deformation, damage and eventually microbial cell death (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2016</xref>).
