<p id="Par47" class="p">Hydro-distillation of 
 <italic class="italic">O. vulgare</italic> aerial parts yielded 0.85 ± 0.05% v/v pale yellow EO. GC/MS of OV EO allowed the identification of 32 compounds representing 99.94% of the oil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Oxygenated monoterpenes predominated other classes of identified components; accounting for 75.41% of the oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This is attributed to the presence of the two major identified compounds in this class. These were terpinen-4-ol (38.35%) and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-sabinene hydrate (10.06%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Other major identified constituents included α-terpineol (7.32%), α-terpinene (4.51%), 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate (4.27%) and 4-terpinyl acetate (4.13%).
