<p id="Par49" class="p">Results of agar and broth dilution methods against the tested organisms are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. MIC values of agar dilution method revel that OV EO emulsion had the best activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Br. bronchiseptica</italic> and all the tested fungi with an MIC 2.36 mg/ml. The least activity was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. aeruginosa</italic> with an MIC &gt; 9.44 mg/ml. Broth dilution method showed better results especially against Gram positive bacteria. The most sensitive organism was 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with an MIC 1.18 mg/ml, while the least sensitive one was also 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. aeruginosa</italic> with an MIC &gt; 18.88 mg/ml. Agar diffusion method showed that the highest activity was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">Br. bronchiseptica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Sac. cerevisiae, B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> with inhibition zones 38 ± 1.5, 29.5 ± 0.8, 26.9 ± 0.9 and 26.9 ± 1.1 mm, respectively. 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. aeruginosa</italic> was the least sensitive organism with inhibition zone 9.3 ± 0.4 mm.
