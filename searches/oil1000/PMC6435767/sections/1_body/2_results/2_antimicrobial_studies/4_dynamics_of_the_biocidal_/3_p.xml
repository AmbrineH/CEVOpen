 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows the dynamics of biocidal of 1% v/v oil emulsion against 5 Gram positive bacteria. Among these
 <italic class="italic">, B. subtilis</italic> spores were completely insensitive followed by 
 <italic class="italic">M. lutea</italic> which displayed only small (1 log) initial drop in the number of cells surviving after 30 min contact with the oil with no further drop
 <italic class="italic">. E. faecalis</italic> showed intermediate response for ca 2 logs. Reduction in viable count took place within 2 h contact with the oil and further insignificant reduction occurred during the remaining 4 h of incubation. A sigmoid curve was observed with 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. It showed ca 4 logs reduction in the number of survivor by the end of the first 2 h of contact with the oil followed by ca 1.5 log further reductions by the last hour of inoculation (6 h). The dynamic of biocidal response of 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic> was quite rapid showing more than 99.999% killing by the end of the first 2 h of contact with the oil and no further growth was noticed. When 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> culture was exposed to 1% v/v of OV EO, ca. 5.5 log reduction in the inoculated cells (7.5 logs) took place quite rapidly (15 min) and remained the same for the rest of the experiment (6 h). These survivors were found to be entirely spores; confirming the non-sporicidal activity of the OV EO.
