<p id="Par54" class="p">The dynamics of the biocidal activity of 1% v/v OV EO emulsion against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> (yeast strains) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. The latter strain was sensitive to the oil since practically all the exposed cells (ca. 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/ml) were killed during the first 30 min of contact. On the other hand
 <italic class="italic">, C. albicans</italic> cells exhibited much slower dynamics and, at the end of the experiment (6 h), out of 7.5 logs of exposed cells, ca. 4.5 logs were still surviving.
