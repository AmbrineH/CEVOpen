 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the dynamics of the bactericidal activity of the oil against 3 Gram negative bacteria. The response of both 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Br. bronchiseptica</italic> was quite rapid; more than 99.999% of the exposed cells (ca 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/ml) were killed within 5 min contact with the oil (1% v/v) and no re-growth was detected after that. In contrast, the response of 
 <italic class="italic">Ps. aeruginosa</italic> was distinctly different, exhibiting bilinear response vs. time. The first part of dynamic response was relatively rapid leading to 3 log reductions in the number of cells surviving the first 5 min of incubation. Thereafter, killing rate decreased markedly and, at the end of the experiment (6 h), ca 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> CFU/ml was still living.
