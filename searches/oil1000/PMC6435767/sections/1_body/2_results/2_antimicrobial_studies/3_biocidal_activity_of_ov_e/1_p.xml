<p id="Par50" class="p">Biocidal activity of OV EO emulsion was studied using viable count technique against four selected organisms; 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, E. coli. C. albicans and A. niger</italic>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the relationship between OV oil concentration and biocidal activity against the four selected organisms. Three of the resultant curves were linear over the entire oil concentration range (0.05–5.0% v/v) tested. The curve of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> was bilinear having a much steeper part at oil concentration ≤ 1% v/v. The curves of the four tested organisms displayed different slopes; that of 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> was the most responsive while that of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was the least. OV oil emulsion concentrations causing 50% and 75% microbial growth inhibition were calculated from the dose response curve obtained in Fig.
