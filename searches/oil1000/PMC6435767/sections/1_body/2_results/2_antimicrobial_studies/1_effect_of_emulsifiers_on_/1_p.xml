<p id="Par48" class="p">Immiscibility of essential oils with the aqueous culture media creates a methodological problem due to hindrance of proper diffusion. Accordingly, stable o/w emulsions of OV EO were prepared using Tween 20 and Cremphore El. Antimicrobial activity of the prepared oil emulsions was assessed using viable count technique. Results shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> reveal that the use of these emulsifiers did not significantly affect the biocidal activity of OV EO Tween 20 was chosen for the experiments due to its relatively lower cost.
