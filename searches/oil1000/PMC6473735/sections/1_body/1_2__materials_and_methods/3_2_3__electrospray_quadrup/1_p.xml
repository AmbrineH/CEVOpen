<p class="p">A Maxis II type Qq-TOF MS instrument (Bruker Daltoniks, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source was used. The spray voltage was 4.5 kV. The resolution of the instrument was 40,000 at

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was utilized as the drying gas (200 °C, 4.0 L/min), nebulizer gas (0.5 bar) and collision gas. The collision voltage was varied in the range of 20–90 V. The mass spectra were recorded by means of a digitizer at a sampling rate of 2 GHz. The spectra were calibrated externally by ESI tune mix, from Bruker. The spectra were evaluated with the Compass Data Analysis 4.4 software from Bruker (Bremen, Germany). The sample solutions were introduced directly into the ESI source with a syringe pump (Cole-Parmer Ins. Co., Vernon Hills, IL, USA) at a flow rate of 3 μL/min. The concentration of the samples was 0.01 mg/mL.
