<p class="p">The MALDI-TOF MS measurements were carried out with a Bruker Autoflex Speed mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltoniks, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. In all cases, 19 kV (ion source voltage 1) and 16.65 kV (ion source voltage 2) were used. For reflectron mode, 21 kV and 9.55 kV were applied as reflector voltage 1 and reflector voltage 2, respectively. A solid phase laser (355 nm, ≥100 μJ/pulse) operating at 500 Hz was applied to produce laser desorption and 15,000 shots were summed. The MALDI-TOF MS spectra were internally calibrated with a mixture of α-,β-,γ-cyclodextrin, rutin and lactose octaacetate.</p>
