<p class="p">The matrix used for the MALDI-TOF MS was 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone (THAP), dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. The epoxidized oils were also dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Sodium trifluoroacetate was used as the ionizing agent (5 mg/mL). The mixing ratio was 50/10/5/2 (matrix/oil/cationizing agent/internal standard mixture). A volume of 0.25 μL of the solution was deposited onto a metal sample plate and allowed to air-dry.</p>
