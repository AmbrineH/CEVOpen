<p class="p">This study explored the applicability of soft ionization mass spectrometry, including MALDI and ESI, for epoxidized vegetable triglyceride oils, which are important polymer raw materials. Mass-remainder analysis (MARA), our recently invented data mining procedure, was used to process the mass spectra of these complex samples of natural origin. MARA was particularly useful for the identification of different epoxidized triglyceride series, such as triglycerides with 100% DOE (with all the double bonds converted to epoxide groups), triglycerides with one remaining double bond, or with diol side products. Furthermore, MARA facilitated the determination of the number of epoxide groups and subsequently the number of carbon atoms in the triglyceride. In addition, our MS/MS experiments revealed that the sodiated ETG adduct ions have very clear fragmentation pathways, in contrast to those of the other adducts (H
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, Li
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, and NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>). This important finding enables the estimation of the epoxidized fatty acid composition of epoxidized triglyceride oils by means of MS/MS, without any complicated and time-consuming sample preparation, derivatization, or separation. It can be particularly useful in the characterization of the fatty acids variety of complex vegetable oil mixtures. Interestingly, this clear and informative fragmentation behavior does not apply to the sodiated adducts of the non-epoxidized triglyceride oils due to their inefficient fragmentation in CID experiments.
