 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. In the case of the total (100%) conversion of double bonds to epoxide groups (DOE = 100%), the MR values depended merely on the NEG. An additional epoxide ring, i.e., the replacement of a (CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>)
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> moiety by a C
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O group, resulted in a −0.0364 shift in the MR value, as illustrated by the horizontal lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b. (Note that the compounds differing only in the number of CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> groups have the same MR values.) Using NEG–MR mapping, the ETGs with no remaining double bonds (DOE = 100%) can be identified in the complex mass spectra, and the number of epoxide groups and subsequently the number of carbon atoms in the ETG can be determined. For example, an MR = 2.7288 value was calculated for the peak at
