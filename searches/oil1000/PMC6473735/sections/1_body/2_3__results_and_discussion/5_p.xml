<p class="p">In our experiments, the 100% conversion of double bonds to epoxide rings was typical (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a, the triglycerides with one remaining double bond (yellow highlight) and diol side products (blue highlight) were also identified. The identification of these series in the mass spectrum was not straightforward, but MARA was able to filter these compound classes based on their MR values. In addition, this grouping can be visualized in the MR versus

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a, light blue dots). As an advantage of the MARA data processing method, the isotopes were clearly separated exactly by the Î”MR = 1 mass remainder value difference.
