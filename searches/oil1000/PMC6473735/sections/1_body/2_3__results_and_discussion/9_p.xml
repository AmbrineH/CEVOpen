<p class="p">It seems at first glance, that the product ion spectra of the sodiated adduct ions are simpler than those of other adducts formed with H

 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, and NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> ions. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the significant reaction in the collision-induced dissociation (CID) process is the decomposition of the sodiated ETG to yield an epoxidized diglyceride and a single epoxidized fatty acid (EFA). In contrast, various other reactions can be observed, resulting in more complex product ion spectra for the lithiated and ammoniated adducts (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00394" class="xref">Figures S1 and S2</xref>), including water elimination and EFA backbone cleavage. The proposed fragmentation pathways for the sodiated and ammoniated ETG adducts are presented in the

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00394" class="xref">Figures S3 and S4</xref>, respectively. It can also be observed, that even though the same sodiated precursor ions, such as 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 997 (57:6), were selected, the intensity ratios of the product ions showed large differences in the case of epoxidized linseed and soybean oil (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a,b). For example, the intensity ratios of the product ions at 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 335 and 349 (corresponding to the sodiated adducts of the epoxidized linoleic acid (ELA) and epoxidized linolenic acid (ELNA), respectively) were 0.32 and 4.4 for the linseed and soybean oil, respectively. This huge difference is in line with the different LA and LNA content of the two vegetable oils (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, the clear product ion spectra of the sodiated ETG adducts provide a possibility to determine the EFA compositions of these oils by MS/MS, as a novel approach. The breakdown curves, i.e., the relative intensities of product ions versus collision energy plot of ETGs suggest that below a collision energy of about 70 eV the simultaneous reactions were dominant in the product ion formation. Thus, the consecutive reactions can be neglected, since the breakdown curves of the product ions with two EFA chains start to decrease above 70 eV (see the breakdown plot of the sodiated ETG (57:6) as an example in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00394" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). It means that the fragmentation reactions can be simplified as the loss of an EFA chain. For instance, if the lost EFA is the epoxidized linolenic acid (ELNA), the sodium ion can remain attached either to the epoxidized diglyceride, resulting in the product ion at

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 671 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, or to the single EFA (ELNA in this case) yielding the product ion at 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 349. Furthermore, this approach enables the estimation of the percentage of ELNA in the ETG (57:6) specimen (the precursor ion at 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 997 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), as the relative intensity of the sum of the product ions at 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 671 and 349 is related to the sum of all the product ions. Performing this calculation for all the ETG specimens (after recording their MS/MS spectra), and summarizing the percentages of the EFA weighted by the corresponding intensities of the ETG specimens in the MS spectrum (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>b in the case of linseed oil), provides the percentage of the EFA in the epoxidized triglyceride oil. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00394-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the epoxidized fatty acid composition of the epoxidized linseed oil calculated by our approach compared to the theoretical values found in the literature [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-11-00394" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] (the EFA composition of soybean oil is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-11-00394" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The similarity of the EFA distributions suggests that our simple method is capable of estimating the epoxidized fatty acid composition of the epoxidized triglyceride oils, and that it does not require any complicated and time-consuming sample preparation, derivatization, or separation prior to MS measurements.
