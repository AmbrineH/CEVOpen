<p class="p">Our next goal was to gain a deeper insight into the structure of the epoxidized triglycerides of natural origin by soft ionization tandem mass spectrometry. In the following, we will use the epoxidized prefix to indicate that all the double bonds have been converted to epoxide groups in the molecule. In the first step, the fragmentation mechanisms of the ETG adducts formed with different cations (such as H
