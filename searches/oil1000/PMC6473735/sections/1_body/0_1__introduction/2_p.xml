<p class="p">Since vegetable oils vary widely in their chemical microstructure, the choice of triglyceride oil has a crucial influence on the properties of the polymer product. Therefore, the characterization of the triglyceride oils is essential for the design of new materials and for quality control in biopolymer production. Characterization usually means the determination of the fatty acid composition, the degree of unsaturation, the number of epoxide groups per molecule (NEG) and the degree of epoxidation (DOE, the percentage of conversion from double bonds to epoxide groups) of the epoxidized triglyceride oils. The most widely used methods to characterize triglyceride oils are infrared spectroscopy, particularly Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy [

However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies involving the mass spectrometric characterization of the epoxidized triglyceride oils, which are important raw materials in biopolymer production. Accordingly, the main aim of our work was the evaluation of the chemical structure of epoxidized soybean and linseed oils using soft ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).
