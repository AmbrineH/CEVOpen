<p class="p">Recently, there has been an increased demand for the preparation of polymeric materials based on renewable sources driven by environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil resources. Vegetable oils, such as soybean, sunflower and linseed oils, are one of the most important sources of biopolymers [

There is a wide variety of triglyceride oil-based polymers, for instance, oxypolymerized oils, polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides, epoxy resins, etc. [
