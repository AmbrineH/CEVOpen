 <p> MS/MS spectra of the sodiated (57:6) ETG adduct at m/ z 997 of the ( a) linseed and ( b) soybean oil recorded at a laboratory frame collision energy of 70 eV. Abbreviations: SA, stearic acid (18:0); EOA, epoxidized oleic acid, (18:1); ELA, epoxidized linoleic acid (18:2); ELNA, epoxidized linolenic acid (18:3). The chemical structure of the precursor ion ( m/ z 997) is just an example, it can also contain, for example, three ELA (18:2) chains. </p>
