 <p> ( a) Mass-remainder (MR) versus m/ z plot, and ( b) zoomed MR versus m/ z plot of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the epoxidized soybean oil. ETG stands for the epoxidized triglycerides with no remaining double bonds. The size of the larger dots indicates peak intensity. For the sake of visibility, a minimum dot-size was used, therefore the sizes of the unsaturated and diol dots are exaggerated, and do not reflect the real intensity ratios. </p>
