<p class="p">A few studies have reported the evolution of the chemical composition of the EO in bitter oranges during the ripening stage [

 <xref rid="B9-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. They showed that the composition and other properties of the bitter orange EO are subject to important alterations during ripening. The variation levels (%) of chemical classes (monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes) of bitter orange EO do not evolve linearly with the ripening stages [
 <xref rid="B8-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and lead to drastic variations in EO quality [
 <xref rid="B33-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. For this reason, it becomes important to ensure that the EO has been produced with fruits collected at the optimum ripening point. At this point, we should remark that the optimum ripening point may depend on the desired application of the EO; the optimum ripening condition being different for uses such as antioxidant, antifungal, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic, green solvent, etc. [
