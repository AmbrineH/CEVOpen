<p class="p">In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies trying to use the techniques of metabolomics applied to foods. This new approach has been named ‘Foodomics’ [
 <xref rid="B24-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In this strategy, the results of the chromatographic analysis are in many cases further analyzed using chemometrics or machine learning techniques. However, alternative technologies, such as direct injection mass spectrometry and proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) combined with chemometrics methods have recently been used for prediction of sensory profiles [

 <xref rid="B26-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For our purpose, the underlying rationale is that EOs can be characterized by a composition fingerprint. While this chromatographic fingerprint [
 <xref rid="B24-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] will have a certain degree of normal variability, anomalous departures from the normal cluster may indicate voluntary or accidental adulteration. In fact, there is a rich literature in the use of analytical techniques in conjunction with chemometrics for fraud detection or quality determination [

In the case of citrus essential oils, Parastar et al. used GC-MS fingerprinting in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) and k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (k-NN) to determine from which citrus species (sweet oranges, bitter oranges, lemons, or bergamots) the EO was produced. Additionally, they used counter propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANN) to determine the chemotypes responsible for this differentiation [
