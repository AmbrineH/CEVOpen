<p class="p">The aim of this work is to explore the possibility of controlling the original ripening stages of the citrus fruit from the headspace of the EO using objective methods, avoiding the use of costly human panels. We propose to use headspace gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry HS-GC-MS untargeted chemical profiling combined with non-linear classifiers to classify the ripening stage in four classes. Additionally, we will use a feature selection method to determine the most relevant VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) for this differentiation.</p>
