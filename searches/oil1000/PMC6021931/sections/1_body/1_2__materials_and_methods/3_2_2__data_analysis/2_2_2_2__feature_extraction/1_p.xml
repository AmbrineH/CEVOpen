<p class="p">In these samples, several peaks related to volatile compounds in the headspace of the EO have intensities that are well beyond the noise level in a consistent manner. A homemade MATLAB routine setting a threshold to peak heights was used to detect relevant peaks and compute their maxima after baseline removal. The selected threshold was determined to be the noise mean plus three times its standard deviation.</p>
