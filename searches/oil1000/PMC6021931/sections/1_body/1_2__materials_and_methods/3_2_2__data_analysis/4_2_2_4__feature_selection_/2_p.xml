<p class="p">With the selected features, ANN training (see ix. in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-18-01922-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) and final performance assessment using external validation were carried out again. The new feature vector, consisting of selected features, was fed into the ANNs to train the final models with the same methodology described above (see viii. in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-18-01922-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). To visualize the performance of ANNs, the confusion matrix was created for each model and then averaged over the repetitions (see ix. in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-18-01922-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>).
