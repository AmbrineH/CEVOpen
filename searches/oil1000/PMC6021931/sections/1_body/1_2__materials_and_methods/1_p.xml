<p class="p">For the classification of bitter orange EOs, fruits were sampled, and peel oil was then extracted. After sample preparation, the headspace of EOs was analyzed by GC-MS. The total ion chromatogram (TIC) was preprocessed for peak detection and intensity determination. Using selected peaks as the characteristic feature vector, multilayer perceptrons (MLP) were built for sample classification. Additionally, sensitivity analysis (SA) was used for feature selection to detect the compounds more relevant in class differentiation. Using the selected features, final MLP models were constructed for both real and permuted labels. Finally, a permutation test was performed to assess the statistical significance of the performance assessment results. The complete methodology is described in detail in the following subsections.</p>
