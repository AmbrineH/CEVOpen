<p class="p">Xcalibur software Version 3.0 was employed for the data acquisition. The data obtained were further processed in MATLAB R2008. The individual compounds were identified by comparing their retention indices relative to analytical standard solutions and by comparing their mass spectra and retention times with data already available in the NIST (National Institute of Standardization and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) library NIST05 and literature.</p>
