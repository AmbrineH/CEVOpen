<p class="p">HS-GC measurements were conducted in triplicate (three aliquots) at an equilibrium temperature of 110 °C within an equilibrium duration of 10 min. GC-MS analyses were performed on a Focus GC-DSQ II mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). One milliliter of the samples headspace was injected with a Thermo HS TriPlus 300 headspace autosampler in split mode (split ratio 1:20) at 250 °C. The separation was performed on a 30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness 5% phenyl methyl siloxane HP5 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A constant carrier gas (helium) flow rate of 1 mL min

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 230 °C. The final temperature was held for 3 min. The temperature of the MS transfer line was kept at 250 °C. The electron ionisation (EI) source temperature was 250 °C and the ionization energy was 70 eV. The applied method was based on a modification of a GC-MS method found in the bibliography [
