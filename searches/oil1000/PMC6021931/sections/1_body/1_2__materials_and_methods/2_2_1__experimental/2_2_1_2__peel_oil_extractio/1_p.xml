<p class="p">The bitter orange peel oil was extracted from the flavedo using a steam distillation method [
 <xref rid="B5-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Briefly, flavedo peels were cut into tiny pieces and placed in a round-bottomed flask. Subsequently, the peels were extracted with distilled water in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 8 h. The collected oil was separated from water using a syringe. In this way, 101 EO samples were prepared; 11 from the first stage, 27 from the second, 36 from the third stage, and 27 from the fourth stage. The peel oil samples were stored at −80 °C prior to analysis.
