<p class="p">The obtained results show that the ripening degree can be predicted from key volatile compounds in the bitter orange EO headspace using gas chromatography mass spectrometry, avoiding the need for sensorial analysis by trained human panels. The proposed methodology combines chromatographic fingerprinting followed by data analysis using machine learning techniques, in particular ANN. A non-linear classifier (e.g., an MLP) was used since the PCA of the data matrix did not show simple separation of the different classes using three PCs that accounted for 90% of the total variance. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was used to determine the chemotypes responsible for the observed differentiation. The analysis shows that the intensity of fifteen compounds is enough to classify the ripening degree in four classes with a moderate accuracy of 82 ± 1%. The statistical significance of this result was confirmed using a permutation test. The main compounds to predict the ripening degree of bitter orange are α-pinene, β-pinene, ocimene, Cyclopropane,1,2-dibutyl-, linalyl butyrate, myrcenol, linalool α-terpineol, 3-carne, and nerol. These results open a new approach to quality control for bitter orange EOs.</p>
