<p class="p">The input layer of final ANNs consisted of the heights of 15 selected peaks by using the SA. The output layer specified four classes of ripening stages. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-18-01922-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows the performance of the constructed ANNs using the external validation data. The external validation data for each RS iteration consisted of 20 samples with three replicates each. External validation data was stratified per class.
