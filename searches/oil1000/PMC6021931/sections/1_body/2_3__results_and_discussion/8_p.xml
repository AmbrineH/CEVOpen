<p class="p">Thus, the ripening stages of bitter orange EOs were successfully classified based on chromatogram features obtained from HS-GC-MS analyses. This could help differentiating EOs from different ripening stages for their distinct applications. On the basis of sensitivity analysis, the peak heights of 15 compounds were evaluated as effective for the aforementioned purpose. These compounds are among those which were previously reported to have an important role in characterizing bitter orange EO [
 <xref rid="B18-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, limonene and myrcene, reported as the major compounds of bitter orange EO [
 <xref rid="B7-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], were not among the effective peaks for the classification. In fact, Ahmed et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-sensors-18-01922" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] also reported that both compounds have a higher odor threshold when compared to Î±-pinene for example. From this point of view, it seems that the peaks detected by our analysis follow the perception impact of the different compounds. That is, the procedure automatically selects compounds that are relevant from a perceptual point of view.
