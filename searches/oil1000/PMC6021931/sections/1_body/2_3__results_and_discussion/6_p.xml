<p class="p">Despite the complexity of the dataset, the overall accuracy of the model was obtained as 82 ± 1%. It is 20% higher than the average accuracy of models which consider all peaks as inputs. It means that the feature selection not only reduced the complexity of the models but also increased the accuracy. According to the confusion matrix, the mean classification accuracy of ANN models for the first, second, third, and fourth classes was 80 ± 7%, 86 ± 3%, 84 ± 2%, and 76 ± 4%, respectively. The confusion matrix (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-18-01922-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>) shows the model could classify ripening stages of bitter orange EOs based on their extracted features of chromatograms obtained from HS-GC-MS analyses. As shown in the confusion matrix, the second and third stages were easier to classify. September samples were partially classified as October samples (12% of cases), and December samples were partially classified as November samples. We see that the errors appear just in consecutive months at the beginning and at the end of the ripening process. This may indicate a sigmoidal time evolution of the ripening process so that the most important changes occur in the central months, while the evolution is slower at the beginning and at the end of the ripening process. In fact, it is known that the evolution of volatile production can be strongly non-linear during the ripening process. For example, the intensity of β-pinene slightly decreases at first and then increases; while myrcene increases in the initial stages of ripening, but later it decreases and its amount in the initial and final stages of ripening is similar [
