<p class="p">Regarding the training algorithm, the RP was evaluated as the best algorithm in comparison with the LM for the classification of ripening stages. Hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and logistic sigmoid activation functions showed no significant difference for the optimizing criterion. The best ANN architecture in internal cross-validation turned out to be 22-4-13-4, that is 4 and 13 hidden neurons in the first and second hidden layers, respectively. The overall accuracy of the model with 22 peak intensities as input was obtained as 70 Â± 6%.</p>
