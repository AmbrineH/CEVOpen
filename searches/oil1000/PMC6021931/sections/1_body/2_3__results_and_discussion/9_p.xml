<p class="p">Overall, the developed approach can be an effective step in creating an appropriate alternative to the subjective methods of quality assessment of EOs. This highly repeatable and reproducible method can overcome the mentioned disadvantages of sensory evaluation, such as susceptibility to large sources of variation and the time-consuming nature of it. Unlike sensory evaluation, a trained panel is not required. The combination of headspace chromatography and machine learning for classification increases both the speed and efficiency of the proposed quality assessment. Moreover, the need for an expert to design and manage the sensory evaluation and interpret the obtained data was eliminated. As for the limitations of the current approach, we should mention that the current prediction models could be location specific, taking into consideration the conditions of the used cultivars. The present study did not take into account the ability of this model to function for other bitter orange samples over diverse geographical origins. This would require sampling bitter oranges in different parts of the world and remains out of the scope of this initial study.</p>
