<p class="p">For exploratory purposes, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the feature vector (all 22 peak heights). It was performed for initial exploration of the data distribution and to learn about the inner dimensionality of the dataset since we expected a high correlation among the peak heights. The projection of the data to the first principal components (PCs) did not show a distinct differentiation among the fruit-ripening stages (
