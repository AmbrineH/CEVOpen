<p class="p">The many benefits that marine lipids contribute to our overall health are well known and widely documented. High levels of nutritionally valuable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) along with their physicochemical properties, make fish lipids unique and a promising economically valuable product. Although the current situation with fish oil production is stable, future projections show that available wild marine resources are becoming increasingly limited while the demand for PUFA continues to rise. This not only suggests, but stresses the need for exploration and exploitation of alternative sources [

Rest raw materials of the fish processing industry, also known as by-products, vary within species and processing methods used, but generally include parts that remain after edible parts of the fish is removed: Heads, viscera, frames (bones with attached flesh), skins, fins, trimmings, blood and others not utilized for human consumption [

 <xref rid="B5-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The high nutritive value of fish by-products is related to the content of valuable minerals, vitamins, protein and lipid fractions thus they are used in wide range of purposes, from production of fish cakes, pies and nuggets, gelatin, sauces and other products for human consumption to production of biodiesel [

With the growing interest and scientific knowledge within the field of by-product utilization and properties of certain components such as protein and oil that can be extracted from fish by-products, the low-value products such as mince or fish meal have been replaced by products of higher value [

 <xref rid="B8-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Different fish species have specific processing yields and consequently, generate different proportions of by-products. In addition, the quality and chemical composition of marine by-products vary between species, season and catching ground as well as post-capture handling and processing. Although not directly used for human consumption, ingredients from by-products are used as feed in terrestrial livestock industries and aquaculture farming and indirectly contribute to human food production. The possible limitations to by-product utilization are related to lower quality of the fish meal and fish oil in comparison to products obtained from whole fish and elevated enzymatic activity that makes them highly perishable. Several studies showed that oil from by-products can be successfully extracted and refined to remove some undesirable compounds (moisture, pigments, free fatty acids, phospholipids, minerals, off-flavours, etc.) which affect oil stability, overall quality and consumersâ€™ acceptability, without the loss of PUFAs which enables its further application [
