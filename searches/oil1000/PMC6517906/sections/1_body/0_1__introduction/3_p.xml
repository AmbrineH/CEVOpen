<p class="p">The aim of this research was to: (i) Produce and characterize crude oils from processing by-products obtained from farmed fish (tuna, seabass, and seabream); (ii) investigate the changes in fish oil characteristics during a four-stage refining process (degumming, neutralization, bleaching, deodorization) and differences in PUFAs composition between crude and refined oils; (iii) compare oils extracted from whole waste generated during tuna harvesting and tuna liver; (iv) report the characteristics of oil extracted from by-products obtained after filleting of farmed seabream and seabass; (v) compare the quality parameters and fatty acid composition of the obtained crude and refined oils with commercial cod liver oil in order to investigate the potential recycling of fish wastes for conversion into products of higher value. </p>
