<p class="p">The total aquaculture production of finfish is estimated at 54.1 million tonnes with a moderate annual growth rate of 5.8% with 37 world countries producing more farmed than wild-caught fish [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The Mediterranean and Black Sea areas have 62% of unsustainable fished stocks, particulary, the whitefish species. With the intent of making fisheries more productive and sustainable, mariculture (marine aquaculture) of seabass (
 <italic class="italic">Dicentrarhus labrax</italic>) and gilthead seabream (
 <italic class="italic">Sparus aurata</italic>) has grown exponentially, with these two species almost entirely farmed in the Mediterranean. The species with the highest commercial value in the Mediterranean is the Atlantic bluefin tuna (
 <italic class="italic">Thunnus thynnus</italic>) with capture-based mariculture (capture of fish from the wild and their rearing in sea cages for periods ranging between 3 months to 2 years) [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The growth of aquaculture also reflects on the generation of aquaculture by-products. In some countries such as Norway or Iceland, a large share of by-products is utilized by many different industries [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], in contrast to the Mediterranean region where this is not the practice. To our knowledge there is no available data for utilization of farmed tuna or seabass and gilthead seabream by-products for fish oil production or any other purpose that would benefit the producers economically and could serve as a reference for a fish by-product disposal strategy.
