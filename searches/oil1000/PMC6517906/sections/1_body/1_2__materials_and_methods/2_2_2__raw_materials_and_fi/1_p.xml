<p class="p">Farmed bluefin tuna (
 <italic class="italic">Thunnus thynnus</italic>) by-products were collected throughout December 2016 and January 2017 during harvesting and the evisceration process (done on board of fishing boat). By-products were separated into two groups: (i) Over 2000 kg of by-products (gills and gut content) were used for tuna by-product crude oil production; (ii) approximately 100 kg of tuna livers were collected (about 930 g each) and used for tuna liver crude oil production. During farming, tunas were fed with small pelagic fish such as sardines and herring and the average weight at harvesting was around 67 kg. Additionally, the farmed fish by-product crude oil was produced from approximately 1000 kg of heads, gills and gut content from seabream (
 <italic class="italic">Sparus aurata</italic>) and seabass (
 <italic class="italic">Dicentrarhus labrax</italic>) recovered from a local filleting plant. The fish were farmed at the same farm and fed with dry pellets (Efico plus, BioMar SAS, Nersac, France). Samples were 400–600 g at harvesting. Each oil was produced in two batches. Special attention was given to temperature regime during raw material manipulation. The crude oils were produced by grinding the raw materials in an industrial grinder (MG 250; Scansteel, Slagelse, Denmark), cooking at 95 °C for 12 min (cooking chamber model C2; Alfa Laval, Søborg, Denmark), and then pressed in a screw expeller and centrifuged at 4200 rpm using a decanter centrifuge type AC0303 CentryFish 1000 (Alfa Laval) which automatically separates dry matter (fishmeal), water and oil. With the interest of retaining the quality of crude oils, they were stored at &lt;4 °C in dark bottles and refined within two days. Commercially available cod liver oil (oleum jecoris aselli; Kemig d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia) was purchased from the local pharmacy and used as the control oil.
