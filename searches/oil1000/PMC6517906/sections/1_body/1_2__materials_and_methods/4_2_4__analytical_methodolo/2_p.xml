<p class="p">The resistance of fish oil to auto-oxidation was determined at three different temperatures (80, 100 and 120 °C) by Rancimat method [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The fish oil (3 g) oxidative stability was tested at three different temperatures (80, 100 and 120 °C), while the airflow in all experiments was constant (20 L/h). The results were expressed as induction periods (IPs) which are the measure of oil stability or shelf-life, defined as the time in hours required to reach the end-point of oxidation.
