<p class="p">The tocopherol content was analyzed using HPLC system equipped with an autosampler, vacuum degasser, binary pump, fluorescent detector and the column oven on the Ultra Silica column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm; Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) by a method previously described by Šimat et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In short, an aliquot of 20 µL was obtained after dissolving 0.5 g of fish oil in 5 mL of hexane and injected into the chromatographic system. The following gradient elution program was applied using solvent A (hexane) and solvent B (isopropanol) at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min: 3% B for the first 15 min, followed by an increase in solvent B to 80% through 5 min, after which the solvent ratio was maintained for 8 min. Over the next minute, the solvents returned to the initial conditions and this ratio of solvent was maintained for another 11 min to ensure column stabilization. The temperature of the column was held at 30 °C and detection observed by a fluorescent detector (excitation 290 nm and emission 330 nm). The compound was identified according to the retention time and quantified through the calibration curve of the standard. The analyses were performed in duplicate.
