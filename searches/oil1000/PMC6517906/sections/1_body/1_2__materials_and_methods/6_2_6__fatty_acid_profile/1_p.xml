<p class="p">The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), prepared by dissolving oil samples (0.1 g) in heptane (2 mL) and by the addition of 2 M KOH in methanol (0.2 mL), were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame-ionisation detection (GC-FID) using capillary column RTX 2560 (100 m × 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.25 μm; Restek) by a method previously described in Šimat et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In short, 1 µL of the heptane layer was injected into the chromatograph with a split ratio 1:100, with the temperature of injector et at 225 °C and of the detector at 240 °C. At a constant flow rate of 3 mL/min, helium was used as the carrier gas. The initial oven temperature was 140 °C, held for 5 min, raised to 240 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min and held at 240 °C for 20 min. FAMEs were identified by comparing to with standards (Supelco 37 Component FAME Mix; Sigma-Aldrich). The analyses were performed in duplicates and the results are expressed as percentages of methyl esters of individual fatty acids.
