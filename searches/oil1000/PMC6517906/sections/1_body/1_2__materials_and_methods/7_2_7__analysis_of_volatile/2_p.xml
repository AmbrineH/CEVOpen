<p class="p">The quantitative analyses and separation of volatile compounds of major fish oil volatile components were performed by GC-FID and CP-WAX 57 CB column (50 m × 0.25 mm i.d., coating thickness 0.2 µm; Varian). At a constant flow rate of 2 mL/min, helium was used as the carrier gas. The GC oven temperature was programmed at an initial 40 °C for 4 min, raised to 190 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and kept constant for 11 min. The temperature was then raised up to 200 °C applying the same rate of 5 °C/min. The detector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The total analysis time for each sample was 67 min. The analyses were performed in duplicates.</p>
