<p class="p">The volatile compounds of oils were analyzed using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with GC-FID. The samples were prepared using 2-cm long fibres of divinylbenzene-carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane (DVB-CAR-PDMS, thickness 50/30 µm) obtained from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). A total of 2 g of oil was placed into a 20 mL head space vial and equilibrated at 40 °C for 5 min, inserting the fibre into the headspace for adsorption at 40 °C for 30 min, then transferring the fibre to the injector port for desorption at 250 °C for 1 min. </p>
