<p class="p">The investigated compounds were identified by the retention time of the corresponding analytical standard, while the quantification was made by external calibration. As the applied method did not ensure adequate separation of 2,4-heptadienal and pentadecane, results for these two compounds are presented as their sum while their concentration was calculated using the calibration curve obtained for 2,4-heptadienal. GC Workstation Version 6.41 chromatographic software (Varian) was used for data collection and calculation [
