The mixture was stirred in water bath heated to 70 °C for 20 min. After the cooling, samples were centrifuged (20 min, 4000 rpm) in order to remove the precipitated gum (degumming). Afterward, neutralization was done by slowly adding (drop by drop) NaOH solution (1 M) to the degummed oil samples in combination with constant stirring and heating at 65 °C for 20 min. The neutralization process was conducted until a pH of 7.0 was attained, and samples were then heated to 70 °C for 20 min, cooled and centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm. The oil thus obtained was washed with deionized water (3-times with 10 mL) by agitation (500 rpm) and heating at 50 °C under vacuum. Neutralized oil samples were separated by centrifugation (10 min, 2500 rpm). The oil obtained after neutralization was bleached with adsorbents (4 g/100 g of oil) containing 1.13 g of activated carbon and 22.5 g of Fuller’s earth. The oil samples were stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 40 °C for 40 min under N

Deodorization of the bleached oil samples was carried out by distillation under vacuum conditions. The mixture of the oil obtained after bleaching and deionized water (20 mL) was heated to 95–97 °C under the vacuum for one hour, with continual stirring. The refining process was repeated three times for each batch of oil.
