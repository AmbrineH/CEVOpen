<p class="p">All the standards compounds, solvents and reagents used in the study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and Kemika (Zagreb, Croatia). Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on a SPECORD 200 Plus (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany). The analyses of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and volatile compounds were carried out by gas chromatograph (GC, model 3900; Varian Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA) with flame-ionization detection (FID). The oil oxidative stability was determined using Rancimat model 743 (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland). The Î±-tocopherol content was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, all components of Series 200; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).</p>
