<p class="p">The composition and relative contents of volatile compounds of crude, bleached and deodorized oils from tuna by-products, tuna liver, seabass and gilthead seabream by-products and cod liver oil (control) are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00125-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Sixteen volatile components were identified (one ester, six aldehydes, five alcohols and three hydrocarbons). In tuna by-product oil the most dominant was the sum of 2,4-heptadienal (from 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> fatty acids) and pentadecane, followed by (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, dodecane and 4-methylpenten-2-ol. The applied GC-FID method did not ensure adequate separation of 2,4-heptadienal and pentadecane, and their concentration was calculated using the calibration curve obtained for 2,4-heptadienal since it was considered more important in fish oil, however the exact amount of the 2,4-heptadienal in the total sum is unknown. Taking into account that other volatile compounds such as (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal (secondary lipid oxidation products) were found in low concentrations, low TBARs values (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00125-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) and previous reports that suggest pentadecane as dominant component in fish oil samples [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], we can assume that pentadecane is the dominant compound in this mixture. Similar was observed for tuna liver oil with exception to high levels of 1-penten-3-ol. Among unsaturated alcohols responsible for the fishy odour of the oil, one of the most important components is 1-pentene-3-ol [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The content of this compound was significantly reduced in all studied oils and in refined oils, with the findings ranging from 0.01â€“1.03 mg/kg.
