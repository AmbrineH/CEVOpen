<p class="p">In seabass and gilthead seabream by-products oil aldehydes, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal and 2,4-nonadienal, were found to be higher than in tuna by-product oils and levels of 2,4-heptadienal+pentadecane were significantly lower. The amount of 2,4-decadienal (from the 
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic> fatty acids) increased after the distillation, especially in seabass and seabream oil. In comparison to studied oils, the control oil was characterized with high levels of tetradecene. The values of two fatty aldehydes, 2,4-heptadienal and 2,4-decadienal are of great importance due to their contribution to the characteristic unpleasant odour of the oil [

The composition and proportion of volatile compounds changed significantly during the refining process and only in tuna by-product oil the total sum of volatile compounds was reduced during refining. The aldehydes are known as essential indicators of the oxidation processes and are also responsible for oil fishy odour, same for ketones which usually have very low thresholds and are derived from autoxidation of PUFAs via hydroperoxides or lipid oxidative degradation. In order to remove undesirable favor components, such as oxidation products (aldehydes and ketone, residual free fatty acids, etc.) the deodorization step is generally carried out by conventional steam distillation at temperatures below 200 Â°C. The suggested procedure does not affect all volatile components equally. The effectiveness of this process is influenced by the applied pressure and volatility of components at high temperature. In this stage, it is also important to inhibit the degradation of the essential components by cyclization and polymerization of long chain PUFAs [
