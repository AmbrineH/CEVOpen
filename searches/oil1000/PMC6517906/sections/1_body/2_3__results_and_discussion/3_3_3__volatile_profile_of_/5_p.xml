<p class="p">The changes of volatile profiles of fish oil, from tuna and anchovy by-products in chemical refining process have been previously reported by Song et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Authors identified 63 volatile compounds, with hexanal, nonanal, undecanal, 2-nonanone, and 2-undecanone being the key volatile components of the fish oils. The study demonstrated that compounds which are most responsible for the unfavorable odour of the fish oil could be effectively removed by the refining process which directly enhances the oil quality. Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] studied the effects of chemical refining and deodorization on fatty acid profiles and sensory characteristics of the tuna (
 <italic class="italic">Thunnus albacares</italic>) by-product oil obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis. The oil was extracted from the heads and was found rich in PUFAs. In comparison to this study, authors found higher content of MUFAs in refined oil (36.78%) and lower content of PUFA (33.18%) and recommended deodorization conditions at 160 °C for 1 h and 200 °C for 1 h for PUFA rich oils.
