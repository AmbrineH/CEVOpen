<p class="p">The aroma components of fish have been widely studied, however volatile compound profiles in crude fish by-products oils and in oils undergoing the refining process have rarely been reported. In general, volatile compounds of fish oils are only identified [

The volatile components in fish oils are usually a result of microbiological spoilage or oxidation processes of lipids, amino acids and proteins and the knowledge of their chemical characterization and changes during treatments is useful for feed and aquatic industry as it opens new usage possibilities of different processing by-products [
