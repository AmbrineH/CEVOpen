 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00125-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A–D. The most dominant SFA contributing approximately 52–55% of total SFA, in all investigate oils was palmitic FA (C16:0). Its content was significantly higher in tuna oils in comparison to seabream/seabass oil and the control. Palmitic FA occurs naturally in fish, being a source of metabolic energy for their growth. The oleic acid (C18:1
 <italic class="italic">n-9 cis</italic>) was the major compound among MUFAs and in the studied oils amounted to approximately 14% in tuna oils, to 40% in seabass and gilthead seabream by-product refined oil. Among PUFAs, high concentrations of EPA (C20:5
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>) and even higher those of DHA (C22:6
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>) were found in all studied oils. The relative contents of EPA and DHA were expected to increase during the refining process [

 <xref rid="B33-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], but in this study the minimal increase was observed after refinement only for DHA in tuna liver oil. However, in both crude and refined tuna by-product oils amounts of EPA and DHA were found to be extremely high. In tuna oils and the control oil, especially in tuna liver oil dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (20:3
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic>), was found in higher amounts (7.32-9.89%), while in seabream/seabass oil its precursor, linoleic acid (C18:2
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic>) was found significantly higher compared to other oils (17.32%). Erucic acid (22:1
 <italic class="italic">n-9</italic>) was found in small amounts in studied oils, with the highest content (1%) found in the control oil.
