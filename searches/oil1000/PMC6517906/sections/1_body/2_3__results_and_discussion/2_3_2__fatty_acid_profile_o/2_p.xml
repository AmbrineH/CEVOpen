<p class="p">The crude oils from tuna by-products and liver contained significantly higher total amounts of saturated fatty acids (32.7 and 35.6%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00125-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) in comparison to seabass and gilthead seabream by-product oil (23.6%). The SFA profile of the oils did not statistically change with the refining process and tuna oils had significantly higher SFA content than the control. The MUFAs content was the highest in seabass and gilthead seabream by-product oil (46%) and did not change after refining. Tuna by-product oil had slightly higher MUFA content then tuna liver oil. The PUFAs were significantly higher in tuna by-product and tuna liver crude oils (37.7 and 35.2%) and they increased to 40.2 and 39.6% in refined oils, respectively. The content of PUFA
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic>, in the studied oils, ranged from 11.6â€“32.3% and was higher than that of PUFA
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic> for 8.9-18.7% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00125-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). A high percentage of PUFA indicates good nutritional values of the studied fish oils. The PUFA/SFA ratio of 0.4-0.5 is considered beneficial for human health [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], and it was significantly higher in the crude oils, while in refined oils it ranged from 1.1 to 1.2, significantly lower than in the control oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00125-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). In general, it is accepted that compared to wild caught fish, modern aquaculture products have lower 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> FAs, and higher levels of terrestrial plant-originating C18:2
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic> as a result of feed composition [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Very high intake of 
 <italic class="italic">n-6</italic> was recognized as undesirable and it reduces the nutritional quality of fish oil. The sum of n-6 was 18-19% higher in seabass and gilthead seabream by-product oils and along with the lowest sum of 
 <italic class="italic">n-3</italic> and EPA+DHA.
