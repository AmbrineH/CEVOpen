<p class="p">In tuna by-product oils the refining process resulted with a decrease share of MUFAs and the increase of PUFAs. This, as well as the content of antioxidant compounds such as tocopherol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00125-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), can contribute to the oxidative stability of oils. Crude oils from farmed fish by-products had high tocopherol content which was significantly reduced by refining process in all oils (31â€“45%). At the same time, oxidative stability was prolonged by the refining process thus the role of tocopherol in oxidative stability appears to be smaller than the removal impurities which act as pro-oxidants [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This is confirmed on the control oil which had over 140 mg of tocopherol per kilogram (data from declaration sheet indicate a content of 1190 International Units of vitamin A per gram) however this content did not enhance its oxidative stability at elevated temperatures. The tocopherol content of oils from farmed fish species is higher in comparison to oils from wild fish and their by-products. For example, sardine by-product crude oil has approximately 30 mg tocopherol /kg [

It has been suggested that dietary elements of fish feed, such as vitamin E, do not influence significantly the amount of total lipids, phospholipids, polyunsaturated and general muscle fatty acid composition but protect from peroxide formation and phospholipid hydrolysis [
