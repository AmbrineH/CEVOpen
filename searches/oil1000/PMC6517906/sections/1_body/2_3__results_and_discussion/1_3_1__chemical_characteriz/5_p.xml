<p class="p">The Rancimat method, an accelerated method that employs high temperatures and air-flow supply to estimate the oxidative stability and shelf life of oil-containing products in a relatively short time, was used to measure the oxidative stability of oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00125-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). According to the presented results it can be seen that tuna by-product oil was the most stabile sample among crude oils with IP of 1.54 h at 80 °C, 0.58 h at 100 °C and 0.15 h at 120 °C, while lower values were obtained for the other two oils. The refinement process prolonged the oil oxidative stability in all cases, but unlike for crude oils, refined tuna liver oil and seabass and seabream by-product oil showed higher IP values than tuna by-product oil (prolongation of 36% at 80 °C, 35% at 100 °C and 52 % at 120 °C). The oil resistance to the lipid oxidation is a result of differences between fatty acid profiles of investigated oils. From the

The refinement process reduced this parameter by half in tuna by-product oil, slight reduction was obtained in seabass and seabream by-product oil, while a higher value was detected in refined tuna liver oil. Although the referent cod liver oil showed the highest stability at 80 °C, at higher temperatures its stability was lower that of the investigated refined oils. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00125-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, significantly higher content of tocopherol in cod liver oil has been detected. This compound has been added during the production of the commercial oil sample in order to improve it stability, but it has been established that tocopherol degrades at higher temperatures [
