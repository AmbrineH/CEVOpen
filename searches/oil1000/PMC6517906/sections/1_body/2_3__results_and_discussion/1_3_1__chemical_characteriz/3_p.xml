 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV and TOTOX values for tuna by-product oil were the highest, followed by those for tuna liver oil and seabass and gilthead seabream by-product oil. The processing steps of degumming, neutralizing and bleaching caused reduction of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV and TOTOX while these parameters increased after the deodorization step. The highest 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV value was detected for refined tuna by-product oil (19.5), while TOTOX values of refined tuna liver and seabass and gilthead seabream by-product oils were higher than those obtained for crude oils, 27.7 and 24.7, respectively. This suggests that used adsorbents (activated carbon and Fuller’s earth) have the capacity to adsorb primary and secondary oxidation compounds [
