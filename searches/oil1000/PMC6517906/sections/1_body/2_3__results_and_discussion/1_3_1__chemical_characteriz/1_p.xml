<p class="p">The results of the chemical and compositional quality characterization of oils from tuna by-products, tuna liver, seabass and gilthead seabream by-products during four refining stages and their comparison to cod liver oil (control) are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00125-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Despite the high temperature used during the oil production (cooking at 95 °C for 12 min) the temperature was found to have a poor influence on oil quality parameters. During preliminary studies we inspected quality parameters in oils extracted at different temperatures (from 65–95 °C) and compared it to Bligh and Dyer extracts [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and found no significant difference in oxidative parameters [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. It has been previously found that oil extraction temperature is weakly linked to the oxidative quality of produced oil, but strongly affected by omega-3 content of the raw material, providing confirmation of our finding [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. To control the quality of fish oil properties, which is very labile to hydrolytic spoilage and oxidative deterioration, numerous standards with variable acceptable levels have been established [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The express lipolysis and oxidation of fish oils are the results of high autolytic activity and high content of PUFAs in fish tissues. It is expected that this process is even more susceptible for fish by-products. For this reason, fish oils usually have high free fatty acid (FFA) content. In this study, the results of FFA values of crude oils were low confirming that short cooking periods during the oil extraction, even at higher temperatures, did not cause significant hydrolysis. Only in tuna liver oil the FFA values were over 3. The refinement process ensured an additional decrease of FFA by 3.7, 32 and 47% in tuna by-product, tuna liver and seabass/seabream oil, respectively. Among the three studied oils, seabass and gilthead seabream by-product oil had the lowest FFA values, even lower than the control. The allowable limit of FFAs value for crude fish oil is in the range of 1–7% of oleic acid, usually 2–5% [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], but the general recommendation is that FFA values of edible oils should be ≤3.0%. This is important since FFAs have an impact on the oil organoleptic properties as well as oil compositional quality [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], can act as pro-oxidants which initiate the oxidation mechanism [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and high FFA values are problematic during omega-3 extraction and biodiesel production [
