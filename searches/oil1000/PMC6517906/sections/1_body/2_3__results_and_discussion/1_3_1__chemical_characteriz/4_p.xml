<p class="p">Although the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV obtained for oils in this study were under this limit, they were significantly higher than the control, thus additionally influencing the higher TOTOX value. The TOTOX is a parameter used to determine the presence of compounds generated by degradation of PUFAs under pro-oxidant conditions including high temperatures, oxygen, metal compounds and light, and the TOTOX value â‰¤ 26 under is found to be allowable for fish oil [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Therefore, in association to the above mentioned PV and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV values, the TOTOX values of studied by-product oils were above the mentioned limit in crude and refined oils from tuna by-products and just under the limit in seabass and seabream by-product oil (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00125-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV value and TOTOX obtained for crude sardine oil were found to be 16 and 40, respectively [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-08-00125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In that study, authors applied the same 4-stage refining process which was more effective for sardine oil and reduced 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV value and TOTOX values to 10 and 19, respectively. On the other hand, as reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00125-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, TBARS assay detected low accumulation of secondary oxidation products. TBARS detects lipid oxidation when thiobarbituric acid and oxidation products from unsaturated FAs react involving several secondary oxidation products, however, the TBARS of by-product oils was lower that the control oil.
