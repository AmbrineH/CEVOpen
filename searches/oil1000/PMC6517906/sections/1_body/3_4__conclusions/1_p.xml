<p class="p">The chemical and compositional quality of the characterization of oils from tuna by-products, tuna liver, seabass, and gilthead seabream by-products during the four stage refining process suggests that by-products are suitable and valuable raw material for PUFA-rich oil production. Crude oils showed good characteristics; and the four-stage refining process was effective in reducing oil impurities resulting in lower FFA, PV, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-AV, TOTOX, and TBARS values of studied oils. Refined oils also showed better oxidative stability. A beneficial compound, α-tocopherol, which might improve the oil quality was lowered by the described refining process in all oils. Volatile compounds responsible for the sensory profile of the oils were formed and removed from the oils during different refining steps without clear relation to FFA and TBARS values. In order to maintain high levels of long-chain fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, the described refining procedure was effective, but for effective removal of volatile components from fish oil, improvement of the deodorization step is needed possibly at temperatures higher than 100 °C for a short period of time. During the search of an alternative source of raw material for fish oil production, the results of this paper have been found to contribute to a more efficient utilization of natural marine resources, clearly indicating that by-products may offer a solution that will improve waste management, an ecological aspect of fish processing, thereby adding value to “waste”.
