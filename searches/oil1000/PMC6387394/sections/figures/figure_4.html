 <p> ( A) Ten possible interactions of limonene (LIM) and CDs obtained through molecular modeling. The green space represents the CD cavity; ( B) Response time evaluation after administration of vehicle, LIM (50 mg/kg), LIM-βCD (50 mg/kg) or TMR (4 mg/kg) on mechanical hyperalgesia induced by acidic saline in mice. The values are expressed as mean ± SEM. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01 or *** p &lt; 0.001 vs. Control group. # p &lt; 0.05, ## p &lt; 0.01 or ### p &lt; 0.001 vs. LIM group (two-way analysis of variance ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test); ( C) Fos-positive cells in the lumbar spinal cord. Vehicle ( D), LIM (50 mg/kg) ( E), LIM-βCD (50 mg/kg) ( F) were administered 60 min before perfusion. The values are expressed as mean ± SEM ( n = 6, per group). *** p &lt; 0.001 vs. control group (one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test) [ 42]. Scale bar: 20 μm. </p>
