<p class="p">Additionally, the antihyperalgesic profile of D-limonene, a terpene found in citrus fruits, was optimized after β-CD complexation and produced an effect lasting more than 8 h, 2 h longer than the non-complexed D-limonene [

The immunofluorescence for Fos protein showed that treatment with D-limonene significantly decreased the number of Fos-positive cells in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord when compared to the control group, suggesting this antihyperalgesic effect is mediated by the involvement of descending pain-inhibitory mechanisms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00642-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>C–F). These effects on the descending pain pathways appear to be common in terpenes complexed with CD and improve analgesic action and pharmacological efficacy when compared to non-complexed terpenes [
