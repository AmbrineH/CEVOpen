<p class="p">Hecogenin acetate (HA) has been shown to have a good analgesic profile, but low water solubility reduces its use in chronic conditions. To test whether the complexation of hecogenin into β-CD (HA-CD) improves the chemical and pharmacological properties of this apolar compound, HA was complexed with β-CD and characterized by thermal, morphological and spectroscopic analysis. Oral HA or HA-CD treatment produced significant antinociceptive profiles and also decreased mechanical hyperalgesia at concentrations of (20 mg/kg). Treatment with HA or HA-CD produced a significant antinociceptive (
