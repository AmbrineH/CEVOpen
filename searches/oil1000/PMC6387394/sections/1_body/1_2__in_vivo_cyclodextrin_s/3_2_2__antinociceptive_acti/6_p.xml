<p class="p">The antihyperalgesic effect of a complex containing β-caryophyllene and β-CD (βCP–βCD) was evaluated in chronic muscular pain in rodents. The characterization of the complex was performed by DSC, TG, FTIR, XRD, and SEM, and these analyses showed that the incorporation of β-caryophyllene into β-CD was efficient. When tested in chronic non-inflammatory muscular pain in mice, the complex promoted the inhibition of Fos protein in the lumbar spinal cord at concentrations of (10 and 20 mg/kg). Oral treatment with βCP–βCD, at all doses tested, produced a significant (
