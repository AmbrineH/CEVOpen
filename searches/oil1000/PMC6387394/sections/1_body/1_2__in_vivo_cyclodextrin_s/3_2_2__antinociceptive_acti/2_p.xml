<p class="p">(−)-Linalool (LIN) is a monoterpene derived from plants, mainly from the Lauraceae and Lamiaceae families, and has anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. As it is a terpene, it presents low solubility and chemical stability, reducing its clinical application. To improve its aqueous stability and solubility and pharmacological effects, LIN was complexed with β-CD. The antinociceptive effects of LIN and LIN/β-CD in concentrations (40 mg/kg), were evaluated using the acetic acid, formalin and hot plate test. Strong antinociceptive activity was demonstrated in all the tests (
