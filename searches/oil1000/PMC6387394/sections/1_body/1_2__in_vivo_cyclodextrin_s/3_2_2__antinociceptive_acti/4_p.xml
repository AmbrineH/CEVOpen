<p class="p">The antihyperalgesic activity of (−)-linalool alone and complexed in β-CD (LIN-CD) was evaluated in an animal model of fibromyalgia (FM) consisting of chronic non-inflammatory muscular pain and its effect on the central and nervous system. The anti-hyperalgesic effect induced by LIN-CD (25 mg/kg) lasted for 24 h, unlike the effect of treatment with LIN alone (25 mg/kg). The central nervous system (CNS) areas involved in the anti-hyperalgesic activity were evaluated by immunofluorescence. LIN or LIN-CD produced a significant reduction in mechanical hyperalgesia in a chronic, non-inflammatory muscle pain model. These compounds significantly (

The development of new therapeutic options for the treatment of chronic pain, mainly those related to the modulation of neurotransmission downstream of pain control, may be viable given the positive results of LIN-CD in the management of pain in FM [
