 <italic class="italic">Lippia grata</italic> essential oil (EO) was complexed with β-CD/essential oil (β-CD/EO) to test its efficacy in the treatment of orofacial pain. The characterizations by Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetry (TG) showed the complexation of the 
 <italic class="italic">L. grata</italic> essential oil in β-CD. The antinociceptive effect was evaluated in orofacial pain models in mice, with concentrations β-CD/EO of 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg. The results demonstrated that treatment with β-CD/EO was capable of reducing nociceptive face-rubbing behavior in both phases of the formalin test. This result may be related to the terpenes in the oil such as camphor, borneol and β-caryophyllene. The antinociceptive activity may have occurred through activation of the motor cortex, the nucleus raphe pallidus (NRP) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (brain areas involved in pain modulation) [
