<p class="p">A public health problem is cancer pain, which itself affects the quality of life of patients as, in addition, do the reported side effects of existing therapeutic options. Carvacrol (CARV), is a monoterpene that has been studied for the control of painful conditions and inflammation. The use of this terpene can be improved with β-CD incorporation. The effect of CARV complexed in β-CD on nociception was evaluated in rodents with tumor cells (Sarcoma 180). The antihyperalgesic and nociceptive effects of the complex were evaluated in mice with a tumor in the paw. CARV/β-CD complex was administered (50 mg/kg) in mice with a tumor in the hind paw and was shown to be able to reduce hyperalgesia for 24 h, unlike the free CARV (100 mg/kg), which promoted effects which only lasted 9 h. Administration on alternate days of the CARV/β-CD complex (12.5–50 mg/kg) reduced hyperalgesia, as well as spontaneous and palpation-induced nociception. However, pure CARV (50 mg/kg) did not cause significant changes in nociceptive responses. The results showed that the encapsulation of CARV in β-CD may be useful for the development of new options for the treatment of pain [
