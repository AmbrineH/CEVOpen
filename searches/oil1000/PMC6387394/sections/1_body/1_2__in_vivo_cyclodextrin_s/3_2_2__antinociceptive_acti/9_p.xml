<p class="p">One study reported the development of inclusion complexes of meloxicam with β-CD and β-CD based nanosponges to try to increase their solubility and stability, and prolong drug release. Particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, stability studies, in vitro and in vivo drug release studies, FTIR, DSC, and XRPD were used to characterize parameters. Swiss albino mice (20–25 g) of both sexes were used to test the analgesic activities of the formulation and meloxicam. The analgesic activity in the mice was determined by counting the number of writhes induced by 0.6% acetic acid (10 mL/kg, i.p.). A greater percentage of inhibition (71.11 ± 1.47%) of the writhing responses was observed with the complex than with meloxicam alone (45.55 ± 2.05%). This was reported to be due to increased inhibition of cyclooxygenase and inflammatory mediators by the complex compared to meloxicam alone [
