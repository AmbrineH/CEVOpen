<p class="p">CD complexation could be the solution for most active substances presenting low oral bioavailability. A study evaluated the intestinal permeability of tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), a substance with cardiovascular benefits, complexed with HP-β-CD. The complexes were obtained by coevaporation. Free and complexed TSIIA absorption was assessed using the everted intestinal sac technique in rats. The TSIIA was complexed at three concentrations (50, 100, 150 µg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and administered in three intestinal segments (the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). The absorption parameters of TSIIA at each concentration in the three intestinal segments were tested. It was observed that increasing the dosage of the complex caused saturation, suggesting that the transport mechanism in vivo is related to passive transport. Greater permeability was found for the complexed TSIIA in the intestinal membrane with increased oral bioavailability [
