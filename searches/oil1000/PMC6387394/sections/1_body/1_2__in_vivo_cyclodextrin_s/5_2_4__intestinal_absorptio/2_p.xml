<p class="p">Genipin is an aglycone extracted from the fruit of 
 <italic class="italic">Gardenia jasminoides</italic> Ellis, and has traditionally been used in China for the treatment of disease, and in industry it is used to produce dyes. With respect to its pharmacological effects, it has anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, and has recently gained prominence for its possible antidepressant effect. However, low intestinal absorption has been a barrier to its therapeutic application. Researchers set out to investigate the effect on intestinal absorption of an inclusion complex of genipin with HP-Î²-CD. The complex was produced and physicochemically characterized by evaluating its in vitro dissolution profile. Intestinal absorption was evaluated by the direct perfusion method in rats, with administration of the equivalent of 50 mg/kg of free and complexed genipin. The study found that the dissolution properties of the complex were superior to the isolated drug, and the rates of intestinal absorption and permeability were considerably greater for the complex [
