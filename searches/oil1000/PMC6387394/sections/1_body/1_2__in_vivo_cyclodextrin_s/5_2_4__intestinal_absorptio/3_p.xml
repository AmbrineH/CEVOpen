<p class="p">The question of how bile salt in the small intestine interacts with CDs has been investigated by researchers. An experiment was conducted using isothermal titration calorimetry to determine how various β-CD and bile salt interact in supramicellar concentrations (SMC). Analysis of the results showed that the direct interactions between the bile salt micelles and CDs were insignificant. From this knowledge, an extended form of Stella’s CDs utility number (UCD), was suggested to achieve total drug solubilization in the intestine where bile salts are present [

In another study, the pharmacokinetics of two complexed substances, danazol—which has high affinity for HP-β-CD and cinnarizine—which has low to medium affinity, were measured in vivo. The pharmacokinetic study was performed by intravenous and oral administration of the CD-IC, accompanied by increasing administration of uncomplexed CD. Cinnarizine did not undergo significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters. The study concluded that the risk of CD overdose is relatively low in vivo when demonstrating substances with stability constants in a normal range [
