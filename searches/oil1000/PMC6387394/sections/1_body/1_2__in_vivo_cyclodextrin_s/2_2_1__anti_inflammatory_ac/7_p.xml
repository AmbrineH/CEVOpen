<p class="p">A study was done into the influence of natural β-CD and its hydrophilic derivatives (HP-β-CD and SBE-β-CD) on the in vitro dissolution rate, in vivo absorption rate, and oral bioavailability of the water-soluble anti-inflammatory agent valdecoxib (VALD). Equimolar drug/CD solid complexes were prepared by the kneading and coevaporation methods. To examine whether the notable increase in dissolution rate observed with CD based formulations may lead to differences in pharmacological effects, the anti-inflammatory profiles of VALD, VALD–β-CD and VALD–SBE-β-CD complexes were explored using the carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema model. CD complexes (equivalent to 1 mg VALD kg) or the drug alone (1 mg/kg) were administered orally as aqueous suspensions with 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose. VALD alone showed a slow in vivo absorption rate with a maximum inhibition of edema (16%) after a period of 3 h. In contrast, VALD included in the cavity of both the CDs showed a higher absorption rate in vivo, achieving a more than 50% inhibition of edema in 1h and a maximum inhibition (66%) after a period of 3 h. These pharmacological evaluations in rats indicated that VALD–CD complexes might be used to develop a new solid oral formulation with an in vivo performance much better than that of VALD alone [
