<p class="p">Another study developed inclusion complexes of meloxicam with β-CD- and β-CD-based nanosponges to enhance their solubility and stability, and to prolong release using different methods (physical mixing, kneading and sonication). Their anti-inflammatory activities were assessed using the carrageenan-induced paw edema model (1% 
 <italic class="italic">w/v</italic> carrageenan suspension). One group received meloxicam orally at a dose of 1 mg/kg and another group received a dose of 3 mg/kg. The meloxicam alone reduced inflammation in the model. The anti-inflammatory activity of the complexes was much greater than the drug alone and suggested that controlled release of meloxicam from the nanosponges occurred [
