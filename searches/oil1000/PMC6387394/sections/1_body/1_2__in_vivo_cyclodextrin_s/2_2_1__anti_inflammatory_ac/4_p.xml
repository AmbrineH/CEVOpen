<p class="p">The pentacyclic triterpenoid pedunculoside (PE), is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. However, its potential is limited due to low oral bioavailability. To reduce this problem and evaluate anti-inflammatory activities, it was incorporated in a CD-IC. Anti-inflammatory studies were performed with ear edema of mice induced by dimethyl-benzene and Croton’s oil. The PE and the PE–CD-IC exhibited anti-inflammatory effects induced in mouse ear edema induced by dimethyl benzene and croton oil. Furthermore, treatment with 90 mg/kg of PE–CD-IC improved the degree of ear edema more effectively than 20 mg/kg of PE in the murine models of inflammation. It was found that PE in CD-IC has low toxicity and higher aqueous solubility, contributing to substance absorption in vivo, and was, therefore, more effective in mouse ear edema [
