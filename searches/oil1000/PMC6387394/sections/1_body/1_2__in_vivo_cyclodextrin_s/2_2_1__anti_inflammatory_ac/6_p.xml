<p class="p">In order to increase aqueous solubility, kamebakaurin (KA) was complexed with β-CDs. The characterization techniques ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were used to evaluate the behavior of the CD-ICs and the interaction of KA with β-CDs. The water solubility of KA was improved in the presence of β-CDs, and the characterization studies showed the positive development of the KA inclusion complex with β-CDs. Results of in vivo studies for anti-inflammatory activity of KA/β-CDs have shown their potential for use in anti-inflammatory applications [
