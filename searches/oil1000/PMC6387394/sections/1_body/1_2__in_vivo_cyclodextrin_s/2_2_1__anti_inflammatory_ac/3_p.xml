<p class="p">A number of studies report the anti-inflammatory efficacy of CD-IC containing anti-inflammatory compounds. A study was carried out with the incorporation in a CD-IC of 
 <italic class="italic">Copaífera multijuga</italic> oleoresin (CMO), comprising mainly β-caryophyllene (β CP), which has anti-inflammatory properties. CMO was incorporated into β-CD and hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) by the kneading (KND) and slurry (SL) methods. Powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the interactions of the CMO with the CDs. Physicochemical characterization confirmed the formation of inclusion complexes of CMO with β-CD and HP-β-CD by the KND and SL methods. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory efficacy of the inclusion complexes, carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice was used to evaluate the CMO alone and complexed with CDs as shown in

With the anti-inflammatory activity in vivo, it was possible to observe that the CMO assay outside and within an inclusion complex, at a concentration of 100 mg/kg maintained its anti-inflammatory activity, with a reduction of paw edema, nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase, without alterations in the anti-inflammatory activity of CMO [
