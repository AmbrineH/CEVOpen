<p class="p">Studies with the essential oil of the 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic> (OBEO) plant incorporated in CD-IC demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-edematogenic effects. Anti-inflammatory efficacy was observed with oral administration of the OBEO complexation with β-CD. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of OBEO/β-CD the following models were used: paw edema induced by different agents and evaluated by plethysmometry; vascular permeability assessed by Evans Blue die; peritonitis induced by carrageenan and a chronic inflammation model of granuloma formation induced by cotton pellets. The doses of OEOB/β-CD were chosen based on results obtained with pure OBEO, using an uncomplexed dose of 50 mg/kg. The complex presented significant inflammatory effects at 10 mg/kg. At this dose, the effects obtained with orally administered OBEO/β-CD were similar to those obtained with the treatment with pure OBEO at 50 mg/kg. As a result of this conjugation, the OBEO presented anti-edematogenic and anti-inflammatory activities that were similar to those observed in mice treated with pure OBEO at a 5 times higher dose. The results of the study indicated that this complex could be used in anti-inflammatory drug development [
