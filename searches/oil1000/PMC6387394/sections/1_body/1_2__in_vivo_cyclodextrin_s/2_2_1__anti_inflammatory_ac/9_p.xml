<p class="p">A study with coumestrol (COU) was conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in wound healing. The study was performed with the complexation of COU with HP-β-CD to improve the bioavailability and solubility of the COU, as it has low aqueous solubility, which is a crucial limitation for biological tests. Fibroblasts and an in vitro experimental artificial wound model were used to compare the effects of the free COU and the complex with HP-β-CD. The 50 μM (66.1%)/10 μM (56.3%) COU/HP-β-CD complex induced proliferation and cell migration in the wounds. The in vivo experimental model of healing (Wistar rats) revealed that COU/HP-β-CD incorporated into a hypromellose hydrogel (HPMC) showed similar efficacy in wound healing compared to the positive control (Dersani
