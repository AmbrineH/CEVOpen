<p class="p">A study with a γ-CD inclusion complex with γ-CD was performed with containing Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), which is an anticancer bioactive component of propolis, was performed. The in vivo study was done with BALB/c nude mice (4 weeks old, female). Human cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the abdomen of the nude mice. CAPE (200 mg/kg body weight) or propolis (250 mg/kg body weight) were as then injected orally. Tumor formation and body weight of the mice were monitored every other day. It has been reported that CAPE-γCD presented higher cytotoxicity for a wide range of cancer cells, is stable in an acid medium and is, therefore, recommended as a potent anticancer treatment [
