<p class="p">To increase bioavailability and solubility, betulinic acid, a very promising anti-melanoma agent, was complexed with water-soluble Î³-CD. The physical chemical characterization was done by DSC, X-ray and SEM. Its antiproliferative activity was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and cell cycle analysis. An animal model of murine melanoma in mice was used to test the complex (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). The results showed a reduction in tumor volume and weight, showing that this complexation was beneficial in antiproliferative activity and the reduction of tumor development in vivo [
