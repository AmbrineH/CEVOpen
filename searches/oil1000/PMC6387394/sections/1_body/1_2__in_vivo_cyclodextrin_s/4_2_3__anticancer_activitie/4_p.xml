<p class="p">Albendazole (ABZ) is an anticancer drug, but has poor aqueous solubility. ABZ was complexed with SBE-β-CD and HP-β-CD. In vivo anticancer studies were done with mice injected intraperitoneally with ovcar-3 cells. Two weeks later, treatment started with 50 mg/kg of ABZ-SBE-β-CD injected in a phosphate buffered saline (200 μL volume of solution) in group 1. The controls received only SBE-β-CD in group 2. Abdominal circumference remained almost constant up to 32 days with treatment starting at day 14. The volume of ascites in ABZ-SBE-β-CD treated group was significantly reduced (&gt;50%) compared to the control (

The tumor weight was measured at the end of the 36-day treatment period, the weight in the ABZ-SBE-β-CD group was 30% higher compared to the SBE-β-CD control, but was not statistically significant (
