<p class="p">Phenoxodiol was complexed with β-CD to overcome its poor water solubility, which limits its efficacy as an anticancer agent. The complex was investigated against three different cancer cell lines, all neuroblastoma cells. The cells were treated 24 h after sowing at a concentration of 1 to 500 μM of the complex. After 72 h of drug incubation, the treatment medium was replaced with 10% Alamar blue in fresh medium and the cells were incubated for a further 6 h. The metabolic activity was detected by spectrophotometric analysis evaluating the absorbance of the Alamar blue. The aqueous solubility of the phenoxodiol in β-CD was improved and the in vitro biological evaluation revealed increased antiproliferative activity against the three cancer cell lines. In addition, the toxicity of the complex against normal human cell line was 2.5-fold lower. These data indicate that the encapsulation of phenoxodiol in β-CD leads to an improvement in its water solubility and biological activity [
