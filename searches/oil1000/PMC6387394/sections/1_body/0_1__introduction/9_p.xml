 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-00642" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In vitro and in vivo studies of inclusion complexes with CDs may provide evidence of their therapeutic effect. This review highlights studies using in vitro assays to evaluate the inclusion complexes with CDs in relation to their antimicrobial, antichagasic, antitumor, and antioxidant properties, and in vivo bioassays examining their anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anticancer, intestinal absorption, and other characteristics.
