<p class="p">In respect of their chemical structure, cyclodextrins have a cavity size which is determined by the number of glucose units. The free hydroxyls on the outside of the CDs impart a more hydrophilic character, whereas the oxygen atoms in the glycosidic bonds and the hydrogen atoms impart a hydrophobic character within the cavity, which allows the dissolution in aqueous medium of compounds with low solubility. In addition, the space inside the molecule of the cyclodextrins allows the formation of inclusion complexes with compounds that present little solubility [
