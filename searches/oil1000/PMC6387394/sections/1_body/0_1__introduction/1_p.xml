<p class="p">In 1891, Antoine Villiers first isolated oligosaccharides produced by starch or starch derivatives using the enzyme cyclodextrin (CD) glycosyltransferase. Cyclodextrins (CDs) have, therefore, been known for more than 120 years, but only really took off in the 1980s with the first applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries. This expansion occurred with industrial scale production of the three cyclodextrins: alpha-cyclodextrin (α-CD), beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and gamma-cyclodextrin (γ-CD). They were produced in pure form as early as 1984, lowering prices, which contributed to their development, especially that of β-CD [
