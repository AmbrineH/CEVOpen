<p class="p">Ferulic acid (FA) is a highly effective antioxidant and photoprotector, already recognized as a sunscreen, but not suitable for use in cosmetic formulations due to its low physical and chemical stability. For ingredients used in cosmetics, the formation of inclusion complexes can increase stability, solubility, and delivery on the skin. The preparation of inclusion complexes of α-CD with FA by the co-precipitation method was realized from an aqueous solution with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and incorporation of this complex into an oil/water emulsion (o/w). The complex was analyzed by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), X-ray diffraction, 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, photostability, release, and antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of the complex was also assessed using ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity), which measures the antioxidant inhibiting oxidation induced by peroxyl radical with a fluorescent probe, with the antioxidant capacity of a substance being determined by the rate of reduction of fluorescence over time. The results of this analysis showed that the antioxidant inclusion complex with FA had lower antioxidant power when compared to the FA. The authors correlated this fact firmly with the encapsulation of the FA inside the cavity of the α-cyclodextrin, making it less available for interaction with the peroxyl radical. There was a delay in the release of the FA complexed in emulsion. The authors claimed these results suggested that complexes topically applied as sunscreen would be safe and ensure long lasting protection from sun exposure [
