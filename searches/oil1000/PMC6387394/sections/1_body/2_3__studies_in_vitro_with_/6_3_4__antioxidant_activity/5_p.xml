<p class="p">Curcumin is a polyphenol with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. However, its application is limited by its low solubility and oral bioavailability. Inclusion complexes using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) were made. The complexes were obtained by different methods and their physicochemical parameters were assessed before an in vitro test in a cell line of human hepatic cancer (HepG-2) was carried out. In these cells, the antioxidant activity of the complex was assessed by measurement of cellular reactivate oxygen species (ROS), using 2,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA), a fluorogenic dye. Doxorubicin was used as a control ROS inducing substance. The cells were treated with SBE-β-CD by means of equivalent doses of curcumin alone, which ranged from 0.1–50 µM. The experiment showed an improvement in the antioxidant activity of CR as a consequence of complexation with SBE-β-CD, thanks to the considerable increase in its solubility [
