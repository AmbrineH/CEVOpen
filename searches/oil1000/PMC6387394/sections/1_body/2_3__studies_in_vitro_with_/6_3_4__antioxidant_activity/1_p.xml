<p class="p">Antioxidants present limited applicability due to their instability in light and oxygen, as well as their low solubility in water. Complexation with cyclodextrins can provide greater stability to these molecules which have great therapeutic potential. Studies have been done with catechin, whose potential applications are limited by its instability. One study produced inclusion complexes with β-CD, HP-β-CD, and CD-Mβ for application in food and health supplements. The complex with β-CD was used for the evaluation of stability, and physicochemical and antioxidant properties. The complexation with β-CD improved the solubility of catechin, and its stability against temperature, light, and oxygen. The antioxidant activity was measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reduction. When DPPH accepts an electron donated by the DPPH antioxidant compound it is discolored, which can be measured quantitatively from the changes in absorbance. The inclusion complex was calculated as having an antioxidant activity of 24 mg, while that of catechin alone was 4.7 mg. The complex presented activity approximately three-fold greater than the activity of the pure compound [
