<p class="p">Diosmin (DIOS) is a flavonoid that has strong antioxidant activity, as well as other important effects in inflammatory conditions, cancer and the treatment of ulcers. Its solubility limits its therapeutic applications. Thus, there is a need to develop a water-soluble formulation that allows better dissolution and absorption, and consequently greater bioavailability. This may also result in the development of pharmaceutical products with lower doses, because the dissolution efficiency leads to a higher percentage of the drug being absorbed. Complexes were obtained by the kneading method, with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The formation of the complex was confirmed by FTIR spectral analysis, XRD, DSC, SEM, and 1:00 NMR. The antioxidant activity was measured by DPPH, with the results indicating a significantly higher DPPH reduction rate when the DIOS was complexed with Î²-CD compared to pure DIOS. This enhanced antioxidant activity of the DIOS complex was probably due to higher solubility of the active binary complex, resulting in greater solubility, dissolution, and antioxidant activity [
