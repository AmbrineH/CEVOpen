<p class="p">In another study, the authors assessed the capacity of the extract obtained from the seeds of the milk thistle to penetrate the skin and its antioxidant activity after complexation in HP-β-CD (phytocomplex) and incorporation in appropriate formulations. The extract from MT consists mostly of a mixture of flavonoids called silymarin which have high antioxidant power in skin cells. Two water-in-oil emulsions, one enriched with dry milk thistle matter and melon (MT) and the other a binary complex composed of MT and HP-β-CD (1:4 p/p) were produced. They were used to determine the distribution on the skin and the influence of HP-β-CD dextrin on antioxidant activity and extract permeation. The antioxidant activity of the extract of MT was tested by DPPH reduction, showing a change in the activity of the extract after complexation and after incorporation in emulsions. It was observed that the binary complex decreased antioxidant activity of the phytocomplex when compared to the dry extract. This phenomenon occurs due to complexation of silymarin in the HP-β-CD cavity. The complex formation decreased the ability of flavonoids to react with DPPH within 60 min, and it is likely that beyond this period of time there was activity. Ex vivo and in vitro permeation tests showed a lower and more controlled rate of release of the phytocomplex when compared with the pure extract. The authors concluded that cyclodextrins appear to be good excipients for the complexation and silymarin, because there was less degradation of the flavonoids [
