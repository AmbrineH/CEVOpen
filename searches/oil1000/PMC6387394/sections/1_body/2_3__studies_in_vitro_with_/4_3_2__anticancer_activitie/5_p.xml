<p class="p">In vitro cytotoxicity of ABZ-SBE-β-cyclodextrin in ovarian tumor cell line OVCAR-3 and human ovarian epithelial cells Ovcar-3 cells was evaluated. The absorption of 8.0 mg/mL solution containing 7.0 mg/mL (ABZ) at 40% CD at 25 °C, showed the maximum complexity with SBE-β-CD and HP-β-CD, mainly at three days, with stability of 2 weeks. [ABZ] complexed with SBE-β-CD exhibited potent cytotoxicity (in vitro and in vivo) in ovarian tumor cells [
