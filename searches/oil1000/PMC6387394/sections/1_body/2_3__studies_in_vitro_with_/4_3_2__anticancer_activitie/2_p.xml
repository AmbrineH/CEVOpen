<p class="p">A curcumin–cyclodextrin complex improved curcumin delivery and enhanced its therapeutic efficacy compared with free curcumin in in vitro assays with lung cancer cells, which seemed to involve, at least in part, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/NF-κB pathway associated with increased Bax/caspase 3 expression. Cell viability was determined by a colorimetric assay using MTT 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiagol-2yl)-2,5-diplenyltertrazollium. The MTT assay showed that free curcumin and the β-cyclodextrin-curcumin complex inhibited human lung cancer cell growth. Moreover, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
