<p class="p">A study presented the preparation, characterization and properties of a chrysin-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex. The stoichiometry of the inclusion complex was established to be 1:3 (chrysin to β-cyclodextrin), with an inclusion rate of 90.5 ± 2.63 at 55 °C. The MTT method was used to explore the inhibition of mouse hepatoma H22 cells by the chrysin–β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex. The ability of chrysin and the inclusion complex to inhibit H22 tumor cells had no obvious dependency on concentration. When the chrysin sample concentration was 0.25 mol/mL, the inhibition rate was 33.52%. The inclusion complex reached a maximum inhibition rate of 25.64% at 1 mol/ mL [
