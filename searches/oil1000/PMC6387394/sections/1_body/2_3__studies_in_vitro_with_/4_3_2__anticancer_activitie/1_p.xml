<p class="p">Aphidicolin (APH), a tetracyclic diterpene, exhibits specific cytotoxic action against neuroblast cells (NB). This diterpene is important for the development of new antitumor drugs because treatment failure in most patients with NB is related to primary or acquired resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. One study compared the antitumor efficacy of APH in parental cell lines and cell subclones that showed drug resistance to vincristine (VCR), doxorubicin (DOX), and cisplatin. To improve the solubility of APH in water, gamma-cyclodextrin APH IC (gamma-CD) was used for the systemic treatment of xenotransplanted parental tumors and resistant VCRs. The cells used in the study were neuroblast cells. The inclusion complex with a concentration of 2 mg/mL of APH presented antitumoral action about 2-fold lower than that of the free drug. APH and its IC-gamma CDs reduced the growth of NB cells in vitro. The growth of tumors sensitive to NB and VCR was inhibited in equal doses in a dose-dependent manner in vivo [
