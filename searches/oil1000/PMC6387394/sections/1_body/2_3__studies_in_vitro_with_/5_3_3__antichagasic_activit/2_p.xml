<p class="p">One study analyzed the trypanocidal activity of BNZ alone and complexed with methylated-β-cyclodextrin (RM-β-CD). The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values obtained for free BNZ and for BNZ: RM-β-CD were 0.037 ± 0.2 mM and 0.027 ± 0.4 mM, respectively. The results showed that the growth inhibition performances of BNZ and RM-β-CD were similar and dose and time dependent, achieving a 92% inhibition of growth for both BNZ and 0.027 mM complexes. The BNZ complexation with CDs maintained the trypanocidal activity, which is of great importance. The BNZ inclusion complex with CDs is a promising alternative for the development of a new, safe and stable product for the treatment of Chagas disease [
