<p class="p">Previous studies have reported that nitroaromatic compounds have activity against 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic>. For this reason, the idea that an analogue of metronidazole1-(2-iodo ethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole (MTZ-I) might also exhibit trypanocidal activity makes sense. However, it is not suitable for use in pharmaceutical formulations because of its low solubility. Thus, an inclusion complex with β-CD was produced using the physical mixture method with 1:1 stoichiometry. The samples were physicochemically characterized by phase solubility, DSC, FTIR and molecular modeling. The results showed an interaction between the MTZ-I and the β-CD, demonstrated by physicochemical modifications of the inclusion complex compared with MTZ-I alone. In vitro trypanocidal activity against amastigote and trypomastigote forms of 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> were evaluated and a cytotoxicity study was performed. The results showed that MTZ-I: β-CD was 10 times more active than MTZ-I alone, demonstrating that the presence of an iodine atom on the side chain increased trypanocidal activity while leaving cytotoxicity unaltered [
