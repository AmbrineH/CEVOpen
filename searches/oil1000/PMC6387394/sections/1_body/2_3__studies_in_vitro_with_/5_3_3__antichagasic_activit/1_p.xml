<p class="p">Benznidazole (BNZ) has low solubility and high toxicity but is a very promising drug for the treatment of Chagas disease, and it is essential to find technological solutions for these problems of solubility and toxicity. Therefore, ICs were developed and characterized in binary systems (BS) with BNZ and randomly methylated cyclodextrin (RMCD), and in ternary systems (TS) with BNZ, RMCD, and hydrophilic polymers. The results showed that solid BS showed a large increase in dissolution rate (Q &gt; 80%). The CD-IC obtained by the kneading method at a ratio of 1:0.17 (77.8% over 60 min) appeared to be the most suitable method for the development of a solid oral pharmaceutical. The use of cyclodextrins was shown to be a viable tool for effective, standardized and safe drug delivery [

Solid dispersion (SD) studies were performed with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and β-CD in order to increase the solubility/dissolution of BNZ in water. The BNZ was incorporated with CDs using the physical mixture (PM), kneading (KND), evaporation, and atomization methods. The analyses were based on techniques of in vitro dissolution and molecular modeling. Molecular modeling showed that BNZ could form β-CD complexes in different ways, such as in aqueous solution or in a vacuum. In vitro dissolution showed improved BNZ solubility in inclusion complexes produced by the PM, SD, and KND methods with HPMC, and also that β-CD IC produced by the SD method had improved solubility. The β-CD IC is more effective in promoting the improvement of the solubility of BNZ compared to the SD with HPMC and may increase the bioavailability of the drug and improve its pharmaceutical potential [
