<p class="p">Non-polar drugs are usually more soluble in in vitro assays after complexation with CDs than non-polar drugs alone, however, some compounds strongly bound to the CD, limiting their availability in in vitro assays and consequently the biological effects [

 <xref rid="B63-ijms-20-00642" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. The studies suggest that CD-IC are not usually degraded in in vitro tests, therefore, the biological properties are slightly different (mitigated or potentiated) compared to in vivo studies [
