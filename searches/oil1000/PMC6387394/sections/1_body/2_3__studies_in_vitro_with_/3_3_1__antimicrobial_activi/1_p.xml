<p class="p">Carvacrol, eugenol, linalool, and 2-pentanoylfuran were complexed with CDs and their solubility and antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were evaluated. The CDs increased the solubility of the compounds in an aqueous environment and increased their antimicrobial activity. Carvacrol was found to be the most effective antimicrobial compound with the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration—MIC (0.5 μg/mL). Eugenol and linalool displayed a high effect against Gram-positive bacteria, with an MIC of 2.5 μg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 1.25 μg/mL and 2.5 μg/mL against 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, respectively. The least effective was 2-pentanoylfuran but it did show the most promising MIC towards the yeast, 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> (MIC 1.25 μg/mL). The addition of CDs had a marked effect on the antimicrobial activity of the EO compounds. The complexation altered the lipid composition of the main membrane of all the strains analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that cell integrity was significantly affected, resulting in cell lysis [
