<p class="p">Another study presented the preparation, characterization and properties of a chrysin-β-CD inclusion complex. The stoichiometry of the inclusion complex was established to be 1:3 (chrysin to β-CD), with the inclusion rate of 90.5 ± 2.63 at 55 °C. Antibacterial activity was analyzed by the inhibition halo test, measuring the diameter of the zone of inhibition. Chrysin and chrysin-β-CD had a limited inhibitory effect on food spoilage bacteria such as

 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>, with the antibacterial effect of chrysin-β-CD being weaker than that of chrysin. The diameter of antibacterial zone of chrysin was 6.18 mm, 6.12 mm, 6.09 mm, and 6.11 mm, respectively, for the four bacteria. While the diameter of antibacterial zone of chrysin-β-CD was 6.05 mm, 6.02 mm, 6 mm, and 6.03 mm, respectively [
