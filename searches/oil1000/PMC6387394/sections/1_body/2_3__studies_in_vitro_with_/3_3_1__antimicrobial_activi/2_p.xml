<p class="p">The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Hyptis martiusii</italic> (EOHM) is important therapeutically because it has antibacterial activity, but its low solubility and bioavailability compromise its use. β-CD was used as a pharmaceutical excipient to improve the physicochemical properties and low solubility of this oil. Antimicrobial assays with the strains 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> were performed using the microdilution method with 96-well microtiter plates. The MICs for the β-CD alone or associated with the EOHM demonstrated a MIC of 1024 mg/mL, except when used against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 32 mg/mL). The essential oil alone demonstrated an antibacterial and modulating effect against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. However, the inclusion complex provided greater solubility of the oil, but did not demonstrate greater biological activity in the antibacterial assays performed [
