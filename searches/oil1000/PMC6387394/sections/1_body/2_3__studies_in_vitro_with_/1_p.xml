<p class="p">As already described in this article, the lack of water solubility reduces the flexibility for drug formulation and administration, thus CDs haves been used successfully to improve these properties of drugs with poor solubility. The hemolytic effect of CDs has been reported in several in vitro studies; but the toxicological implication in vivo is considered small [

Therefore, it is clear that in vivo and in vitro approaches should take into account essential aspects such as the action of the uncomplexed free drug alone, whether the complexed CD-drug acts directly, and whether the CD-IC is dissociated in the in vitro environment, among other aspects.
