<p class="p">Based on this literature review, it is clear that inclusion complexes with CDs have great potential in the pharmaceutical area, adding to the bioavailability, solubility, and stability of drugs, and improving their desired pharmacological effects and biological activities in vivo and in vitro; however, few studies have explored these improvements through pharmacokinetic studies and the use of molecular approaches. Despite this, the review emphasizes the importance of CD-IC because they represent potential biotechnological innovations, as well as providing evidence to support the importance of further studies to enable the enlargement of the therapeutic arsenal and greater pharmacological efficacy of existing treatments.</p>
