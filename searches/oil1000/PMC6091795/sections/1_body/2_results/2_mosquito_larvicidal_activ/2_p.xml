 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> larvae were 11.51, 67.81 ppm and 18.60, 127.24ppm after 24h, respectively. Among different concentrations tested, there were no significant differences in larval mortality between the two species (P&gt; 0.05). In regression line a positive correlation was observed between the leaf oil concentrations and mortality rates (
