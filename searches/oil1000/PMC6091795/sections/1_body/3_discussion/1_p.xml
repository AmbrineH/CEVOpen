<p class="p">The yield of oil obtained of 
 <italic class="italic">P. orientalis</italic> leaves was 0.5% (w/v). This amount is similar to recent study (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>) but relatively higher than other studies (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). According to our results, α-Pinene (20.17%), 3-Carene (14%) and Cedrol (9.51%) are known as the main compounds of the oil. Similar to those previously reported (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>), the major constituents were α-pinene, 3-carene and cedrol. However, there were differences in the amount of the main components. The differences in the number of compositions in the above-mentioned studies may be due to the collection time and geographic factors (
