<p class="p">The oil analysis was carried out using GC-MS. The GC apparatus was Agilent technology (HP) 6890 system, capillary column of HP-1MS (Fused silica) (30m× 0.25mm, film thickness 0.25μm). The oven temperature program was initiated at 40 °C, held for 1 min then raised up to 230 °C, rising to 250 °C at 5 °C/min. The carrier gas used was helium at a flow rate of 1ml/min. The detector and injector temperatures were 260 °C and 230°C, respectively. GC/MS analysis was conducted on an HP 6890 GC system coupled with a 5973 network mass selective detector with a capillary column the same as above, carrier gas helium with flow rate 1 ml/min. A sample of 1μL was injected in the split mode with split ratio 1:50. For GC–MS detection, an electron ionization system, with ionization energy of 70eV, was used, injector and oven temperature programmed was identical to GC. The Retention indices (RI) were calculated for all volatile constituents using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C

Quantification was performed using percentage peak area calculations and the identification of individual compartments was done using the Wiley 7n.1 GC-MS library, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and those published in the literature (
