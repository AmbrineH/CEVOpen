  <title class="title">Background:</title>
  <p class="p">Natural plant products as larvicides could be considered as desirable alternatives to synthetic chemical insecticides for vector management. This study was undertaken to assess the mosquito larvicide activity of the essential oil from fresh leaves of 
   <italic class="italic">Platycladus orientalis</italic> against two medically important species of mosquito vectors.

  <title class="title">Methods:</title>
  <p class="p">Essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fresh leaves of 
   <italic class="italic">P. orientalis</italic> tree (500g) were collected in June 2014 from Tehran, Iran and was authenticated at the Department of Medical Entomology and Vector Control, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.
  </p>
  <p class="p">In addition, the larvicidal potential of oil was evaluated against late-3
   <sup class="sup">rd</sup> or young-4
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> instar larvae of 
   <italic class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Culex pipiens</italic> under laboratory condition. The mortality counts were made after 24h and LC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
   <sub class="sub">90</sub> values were calculated.

 </sec>
 <sec class="sec">
  <title class="title">Results:</title>
  <p class="p">Forty-six components in leaves of 
   <italic class="italic">P. orientalis</italic> were identified. The major components were Î±-Pinene (20.17%), 3-Carene (14%) and Cedrol (9.51%). The LC
   <sub class="sub">50</sub> values against 
   <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> larvae were 11.67ppm and 18.60ppm after 24h, respectively.

  <title class="title">Conclusion:</title>
  <p class="p">
   <italic class="italic">Platycladus orientalis</italic> oil could be considered as a natural larvicide for mosquito larval control.
