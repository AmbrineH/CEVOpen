 <p class="p">‘Mato Peiyu’ pomelo (
  <italic class="italic">Citrus grandis</italic> (L.) Osbeck ‘Mato Peiyu’) leaves from pruning are currently an agricultural waste. The aim of this study was to isolate essential oils from these leaves through steam distillation (SD) and solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and to evaluate their applicability to skin care by analyzing their antimicrobial, antioxidant (diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay, β-carotene/linoleic acid assay, and nitric oxide scavenging assay), anti-inflammatory (5-lipoxygenase inhibition assay), and antityrosinase activities. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry results indicated that the main components of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oils were citronellal and citronellol, with a total percentage of 50.71% and 59.82% for SD and SFME, respectively. The highest bioactivity among all assays was obtained for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition, with an IC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> value of 0.034% (

  <sub class="sub">90</sub> of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils against 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic> ranged from 0.086% to 0.121% (

  <italic class="italic">v</italic>). Citronellal and citronellol were the main contributors, accounting for at least 54.58% of the essential oil’s bioactivity. This paper is the first to report the compositions and bioactivities of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil, and the results imply that the pomelo leaf essential oil may be applied in skin care.
