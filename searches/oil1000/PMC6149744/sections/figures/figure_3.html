 <p> Nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging ratio (%) of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oils, citronellal, and citronellol. SD-EO, SFME-EO, citronellal, and citronellol were measured at a concentration of 0.250% ( v/ v). SD-CC and SFME-CC were measured at concentrations of 0.127% and 0.150% ( v/ v) according to the composition ratios in 0.250% ( v/ v) SD-EO and SFME-EO, respectively. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation based on triplicate determination. </p>
