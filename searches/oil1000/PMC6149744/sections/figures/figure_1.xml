  <p class="p">Inhibitory ratio (%) of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oils (SD-EO and SFME-EO), citronellal, and citronellol against four microbial strains. SD-CC and SFME-CC were the mixtures of citronellal and citronellol, which were tested at concentrations determined according to composition ratios relative to the essential oils obtained through SD and SFME, respectively. SD-EO, SFME-EO, citronellal, and citronellol were measured at a concentration of 0.0500% (
