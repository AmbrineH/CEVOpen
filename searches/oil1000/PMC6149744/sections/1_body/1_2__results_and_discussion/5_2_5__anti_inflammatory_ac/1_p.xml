<p class="p">The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitory activity of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf EO was similar between SD and SFME. Both SD-EO and SFME-EO exhibited stronger activity in the 5-LOX assay than they did in the antioxidant assays, with IC

These results imply that the potent 5-LOX inhibition of the Mato Peiyu leaf essential oil was attributable the combined effects of the main components and the minor constituents, in which the major contributors were citronellal and citronellol.
