<p class="p">Studies have determined that citronellol inhibited NO and PGE2 production in a concentration-dependent manner by inhibiting iNOS enzymatic activity and reducing the LPS-induced COX-2 protein and mRNA expression levels [

The present study revealed that citronellol and citronellal accounted for a high percentage in the ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil (50–60%) (
