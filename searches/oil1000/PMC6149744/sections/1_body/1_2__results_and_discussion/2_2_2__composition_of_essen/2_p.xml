<p class="p">The major constituents of the SD-EO were citronellal (34.54%), citronellol (16.17%), citronellyl butyrate (10.00%), β-caryophyllene (8.22%), and (−)-β-pinene (7.33%). By contrast, the main components of the SFME-EO were citronellal (30.87%), citronellol (28.95%), (−)-β-pinene (9.58%), α-ocimene (6.38%), and citronellyl butyrate (5.70%) (

Citronellal, which was the most abundant compound in both essential oils, belongs to the family of monoterpene aldehydes. Citronellol, a monoterpene alcohol, was identified as the second major compound in the essential oils and was of a higher relative percentage in the SFME-EO compared with the SD-EO. More citronellyl butyrate and β-caryophyllene were found in the SD-EO than in the SFME-EO. Moreover, the constituents of minor components recovered using these two methods also differed. No furocoumarin (a phototoxic ingredient) was found in either the SD-EO or SFME-EO, although ‘Mato Peiyu’ belongs to the citrus genus (
