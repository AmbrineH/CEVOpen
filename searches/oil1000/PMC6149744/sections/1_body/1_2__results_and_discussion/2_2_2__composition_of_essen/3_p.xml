<p class="p">Lin et al. determined the two most abundant volatile components in the fresh leaves of the ‘Wendun’ pomelo in Taiwan to be citronellal and citronellol, which are identical to those in ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil. However, the relative percentage of citronellal (54.26%) and citronellol (11.68%) were notably different from those of ‘Mato Peiyu’. Moreover, the other main compounds found in the ‘Wendun’ pomelo (isopulegol,1,3,8-
