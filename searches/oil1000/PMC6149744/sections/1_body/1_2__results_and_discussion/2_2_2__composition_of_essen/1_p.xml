<p class="p">GC–MS analyses of the ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oils revealed that 26 and 21 compounds constituted 98.89% and 96.81% of the total integrated GC peak area of each essential oil obtained through SD and SFME, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The most abundant compound group in SD essential oil (SD-EO) was aldehydes (34.54%), primarily monoterpene aldehydes. Alcohols were the second largest compound group (19.26%), primarily monoterpene alcohols, which constituted 17.17% of the essential oil, followed by diterpene alcohols (1.65%) and sesquiterpene alcohols (0.44%). Other compound groups in the SD-EO were monoterpenes (18.34%), sesquiterpenes (15.78%), monoterpene esters (10.00%), sesquiterpene epoxides (0.88%), and furans (0.09%). Similarly, the most abundant compound group identified in SFME essential oil (SFME-EO) was aldehydes (30.98%), mainly monoterpene aldehydes (30.87%) with a trace quantity of non-terpene aldehydes (0.11%). The second largest compound group was alcohols (30.64%), of which monoterpene alcohols were the principal group, comprising 29.20% of the essential oil, followed by sesquiterpene alcohols (1.02%) and diterpene alcohols (0.42%). Monoterpenes (22.61%), monoterpene esters (5.70%), sesquiterpenes (4.23%), sesquiterpene epoxides (2.21%), furans (0.28%), and monoterpene cyclic ethers (0.16%) were also identified in the SFME-EO. In comparison with the SFME-EO, fewer alcohols but more sesquiterpenes and aldehydes were present in the SD-EO. Moreover, the oxygenated monoterpene fractions in the SD-EO and SFME-EO were similar (61.71% and 65.93%, respectively) (
