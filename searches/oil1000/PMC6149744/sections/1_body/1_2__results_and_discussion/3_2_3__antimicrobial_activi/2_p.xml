<p class="p">Citronellal and citronellol were the most abundant constituents of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oils (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), at 51.71% and 59.82% in the SD-EO and SFME-EO, respectively. Therefore, the microbial inhibitory ratio of these two compounds were evaluated to study their contributions to the antimicrobial capabilities of essential oils. The results showed that at a concentration of 0.05% (

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, at an inhibitory ratio of up to 92.60%, followed by the antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (84.58%), and relatively weaker inhibitory effects against the Gram negative bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (40.78%) and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (31.19%). By contrast, citronellol exhibited marked antimicrobial effects against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, all at a 96% inhibitory ratio, whereas a weaker antimicrobial effect was recorded against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (71.44%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The results demonstrated that citronellol was more potent than citronellal against all bacteria except 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, against which the inhibitory ability of the two constituents was similar. Citronellol also exhibited greater antimicrobial activity compared with the SD-EO and SFME-EO, indicating that citronellol is the stronger antimicrobial component in ‘Mato Peiyu’ essential oil. Studies have observed that citronellol and citronellal were more potent against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> than against

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Essential oils inhibit bacterial growth through binding of the constituent molecules to the bacterial wall, which alters the bacterial cell membrane properties (hydrophobicity, surface charge, and membrane integrity), leading to leakage of intracellular constituents and cell lysis [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Furthermore, the ability of microorganisms to metabolize the compounds affects the potency of essential oil in inhibiting bacterial growth [
