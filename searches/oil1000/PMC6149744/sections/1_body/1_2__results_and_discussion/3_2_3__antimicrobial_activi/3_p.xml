<p class="p">This study was extended to determine the microbial inhibitory ratios of citronellol and citronellal mixtures (SD-CC and SFME-CC) and to evaluate their antimicrobial contribution in EO. The contributions of the antimicrobial activity of the mixtures to that of the essential oils were calculated according to the results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> and are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The contributions of the SD-CC to activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> were 66.46% and 70.86%, respectively, indicating that the antimicrobial capability of the SD-EO against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> was derived mainly from citronellal and citronellol, but minor compounds also provided some contribution. Furthermore, the contribution of the SD-CC to activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was 54.58%, suggesting that minor components in the essential oil had a similar influence on the inhibitory ratio. Unexpectedly, the contribution of the SD-CC to activity against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> was notably high (126.17%), indicating that other constituents in the essential oil might have attenuated the antimicrobial activity of citronellal and citronellol against 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. By contrast, the contributions (%) of the SFME-CC to activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> were 91.37%, 85.91%, and 91.98%, respectively, suggesting that microbial growth inhibition was mostly attributable to citronellal and citronellol, whereas the contributions of other compounds were smaller. The contribution of the SFME-CC to activity against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> was 60.89%, indicating that minor components contributed a similar effect to the antibacterial ratio. This antimicrobial behavior could be explained by the complex interaction between constituents in the essential oils that produced either synergistic or antagonistic effects on microbial inhibition [
