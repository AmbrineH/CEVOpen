<p class="p">The isolation method influences the efficiency of antimicrobial activity. In addition to citronellal and citronellol, the other minor components of SD-EO also demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> than SFME-EO did (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The contributions of the minor components were 33.54% and 45.42%, respectively. By contrast, the antimicrobial activity of SFME-EO was mostly from citronellal and citronellol, and the other minor components only contributed 8.63% and 14.09% for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have revealed that sesquiterpene showed superior antibacterial activities against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. SD-EO comprised more sesquiterpene than did SFME-EO (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, SD-EO exhibited higher anti-
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and anti-
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> activity than SFME-EO did (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). SFME-CC exhibited a higher inhibitory ratio against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> than did SD-CC with 30.01% and 23.30%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the other minor components of SFME-EO demonstrated higher anti-
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> activity than that of SD-EO, with 39.11% and 29.14% contributions, respectively. This resulted in SFME-EO exhibiting superior antimicrobial capacity against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> compared with SD-EO.
