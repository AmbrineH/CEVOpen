The influence of the extraction methods, SD and SFME, on the antioxidant effect of ‘Mato Peiyu’ essential oil was inconsistent among the three assays. Nevertheless, the SD-EO or SFME-EO exhibited the strongest antioxidant properties in the β-carotene/linoleic acid assay, followed by the NO radical scavenging assay. Both oils were weak DPPH radical scavengers (
