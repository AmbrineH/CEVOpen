<p class="p">‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oils were evaluated for their antioxidant activities through a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, β-carotene/linoleic acid assay, and nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging assay. The results are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The SD-EO was a stronger DPPH radical scavenger with an SC
