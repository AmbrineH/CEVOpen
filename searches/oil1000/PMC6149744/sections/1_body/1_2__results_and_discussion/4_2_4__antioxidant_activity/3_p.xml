<p class="p">As in the antibacterial assay, the bioactivities of citronellal, citronellol, and a mixture containing both were also measured. At a concentration of 0.500% (

Among the three antioxidant assays, citronellol had a stronger effect in NO scavenging and β-carotene/linoleic acid inhibition than it did in DPPH radical scavenging. By contrast, citronellal exhibited higher antioxidant activity in the β-carotene/linoleic acid test and the lowest in the DPPH assay (
