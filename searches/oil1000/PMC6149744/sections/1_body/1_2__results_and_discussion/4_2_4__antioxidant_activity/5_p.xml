<p class="p">The antioxidant capacity of the SD-EO in the NO assay was mostly attributable to the SD-CC, with a contribution of 88.73%. By contrast, the NO scavenging activity of the SFME-EO was almost entirely attributable to the SFME-CC (95.60% contribution). However, other constituents of the essential oil might have enhanced the inhibitory capabilities of the SD-EO and SFME-EO against β-carotene/linoleic acid on the basis of the contributions of the SD-CC and SFME-CC (81.45% and 73.15%, respectively) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>), the other constituents of the essential oils exhibited stronger antioxidant activity in the β-carotene/linoleic acid assay than they did in the DPPH and NO scavenging tests, which contributed to the essential oils having the greatest activity in that assay (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). SFME-CC exhibited a higher inhibitory ratio than SD-CC with 48.44% and 44.39%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, the other minor components of SFME-EO achieved a higher β-carotene/linoleic acid inhibitory activity than that of SD-EO, with 26.85% and 18.55% contributions, respectively. These resulted in SFME-EO exhibiting superior anti-β-carotene/linoleic acid oxidation compared with SD-EO.
