 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The DPPH radical scavenging ability of the SD-EO was almost entirely attributable to the citronellal and citronellol mixtures, with the contribution of the SD-CC being approximately 100%. By contrast, the contribution of the SFME-CC exceeded 100%, indicating interference in DPPH radical scavenging by other components in the SFME-EO. The interference might contribute to SFME-EO exhibiting a lower DPPH scavenging capacity than SD-EO.
