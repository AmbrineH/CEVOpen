 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). SD-CC and SFME-CC exhibited similar inhibitory ratios of 41.39% and 43.88%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The other minor components of SD-EO demonstrated higher antityrosinase activity than that of SFME-EO, with 29.40% and 21.77% contributions, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). SD-EO comprised a higher percentage of sesquiterpene than did SFME-EO (

 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), such as β-caryophyllene, which possessed a higher antityrosinase activity [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Therefore, SD-EO exhibited a higher antityrosinase capacity than SFME-EO. Among all bioactivity assays, citronellal and citronellol exhibited lower antityrosinase activity than they did antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammation activities (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-22-02154-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The antityrosinase inhibitory ratios of citronellal and citronellol were 46.91% and 80.43% (

 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). This result implies that in addition to citronellal and citronellol, minor constituents in the essential oil exhibited some antityrosinase properties. Other studies have found that pomelo leaf essential oil from Mauritius was an effective tyrosinase inhibitor, with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 2.07 ± 0.152 μg/mL, which is comparable to that of kojic acid [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil exhibited weaker antityrosinase activity than it did antimicrobial (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities (
 <xref rid="molecules-22-02154-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). This is mainly because of the low antityrosinase capacity of the main components; additionally, the activities of minor constituents were too weak to provide a synergistic effect in the essential oil.
