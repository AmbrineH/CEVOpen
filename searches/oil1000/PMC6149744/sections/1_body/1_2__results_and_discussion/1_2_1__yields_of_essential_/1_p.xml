<p class="p">The isolation method affects the constituents of essential oils, thereby influencing the efficiency of biological activities. SFME isolates and concentrates essential oil from the plant materials through a combination of microwave heating and dry distillation at atmospheric pressure. This technique provides savings in costs, particularly energy and time [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Hence, in addition to conventional SD, SFME was employed to extract the essential oils. The results show that the yields of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oils obtained through SFME and SD were similar (0.15% and 0.13%, respectively), although the extraction time through SFME was shorter than that through SD (40 min vs. 240 min). The relatively low yields were similar to those of Tunisian pomelo leaf essential oil extracted through hydrodistillation (HD) (0.15%) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Some studies have reported that novel microwaved-assisted heating methods (microwave-assisted HD and SFME) resulted in a larger yield than did the conventional methods (HD and SD) for extracts such as guava (

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and lavender (
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula hybrida</italic>) essential oils [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]; however, other studies have shown no differences between these methods. Yields of

 <italic class="italic">Mentha crispa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oils isolated through SFME and HD were quantitatively similar [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. These results suggest that whether SFME or SD produces a higher yield of essential oils depends on the plant species; however, SFME is more time and energy efficient than SD [
