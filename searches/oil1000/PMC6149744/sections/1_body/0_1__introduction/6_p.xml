<p class="p">This study analyzed the chemical profile and bioactivities of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antipigmentary abilities to evaluate its potential application in skin care. The oil was extracted through conventional steam distillation (SD) and solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME), and its components were determined through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To clarify the contributions of the main components to the bioactivity of essential oils, their bioactivities of the main components were also be determined using the same method.</p>
