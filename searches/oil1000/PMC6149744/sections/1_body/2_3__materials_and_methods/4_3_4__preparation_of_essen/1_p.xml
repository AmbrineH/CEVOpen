<p class="p">The dried-leaf sections underwent SD or SFME. SD was conducted using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus at 100 째C for 4 h. SFME was performed using a modified microwave machine (Sampo, Taoyuan, Taiwan) combined with a Clevenger-type apparatus. Before SFME, the dried leaves were soaked in water at room temperature for 1 h. The moistened leaves were subsequently heated in the SFME apparatus at 540 W for 40 min (10 min at less than 95 째C followed by 30 min at 95 째C). The distillates of the essential oils were subsequently separated, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered with a 0.45-mm filter, collected in amber vials, and maintained at 4 째C until further analysis.</p>
