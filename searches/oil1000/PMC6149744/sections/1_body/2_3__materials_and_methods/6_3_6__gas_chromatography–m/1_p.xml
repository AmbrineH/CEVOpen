The carrier gas, helium, was injected at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C. The sample (1 μL) was injected in the split mode (1:25). The oven temperature was initially 60 °C, was subsequently raised to 280 °C at 3 °C/min, and was then maintained at 280 °C for 70 min. The mass spectrometer was operated at an ionization voltage of 70 eV and a mass range of 35–400
