<p class="p">The DPPH scavenging effect of the essential oils and the main compounds was determined using previously described methods with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. A volume of 0.25 mL of the ethanolic solution of essential oils at various concentrations was individually mixed with 0.75 mL of ethanolic solution containing DPPH radicals (0.1 mM) to yield a final volume of 1 mL. The mixture was shaken vigorously and was placed in the dark for 30 min at 25 °C, and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. A blank experiment containing all reagents except the test compound was conducted on the basis of the same procedure. α-Tocopherol was also analyzed as a reference. Tests were conducted in triplicate. The given concentrations of the main components were measured using methods identical to those used for the essential oils. DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">DPPH radical scavenging ratio (%) = [(Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub> − Abs
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Abs
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of the blank and Abs
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of sample.
