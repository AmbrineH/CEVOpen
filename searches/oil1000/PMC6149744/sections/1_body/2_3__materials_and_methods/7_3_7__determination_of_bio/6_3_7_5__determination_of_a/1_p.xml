<p class="p">5-LOX inhibitory activity was measured using previously described methods with linoleic acid as a substrate [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. A volume of 30 μL of various concentrations of essential oil dissolved in ethanol was mixed individually with 30 μL of 0.1 mM linoleic acid solution in potassium phosphate buffer (PPB) (0.1 M, pH 6.3) with Tween 20 (0.60%) and 500 μL of 5-LOX solution (9.44 U/mL) in PPB (0.1 M, pH 6.3), and additional PPB was added to obtain a final volume of 3 mL. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, and the absorbance was determined at 234 nm. A blank experiment containing all reagents except the test compound was conducted on the basis of the same procedure. α-Bisabolol was also analyzed as a reference. Tests were conducted in triplicate. The given concentrations of the main components were measured using methods identical to those used for the essential oils. The inhibitory activity was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">5-LOX inhibitory ratio (%) = [(Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub> − Abs
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(7)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Abs
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of the blank and Abs
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of sample.
