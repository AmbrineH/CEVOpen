<p class="p">The tyrosinase inhibitory activity assay was conducted as described by Khatib et al. with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. A volume of 100 μL of various concentrations of essential oil dissolved in ethanol was mixed individually with 300 μL of Tween20, 595 μL of tyrosine solution (0.33 mM) in phosphate buffer (16 mM, pH 6.8), and 5 μL of tyrosinase solution (35 U) in phosphate buffer (16 mM, pH 6.8). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the absorbance was determined at 475 nm. 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-ascorbic acid was used as the positive control. For the blank, phosphate buffer was added to the reaction mixture instead of the test sample. Tests were conducted in triplicate. The given concentrations of the main components were measured using methods identical to those used for the essential oils. The inhibitory activity was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Tyrosinase inhibitory ratio (%) = [(Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub> − Abs
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(8)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Abs
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of the blank and Abs
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of sample
