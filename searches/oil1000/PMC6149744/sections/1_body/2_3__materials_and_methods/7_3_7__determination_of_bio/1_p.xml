<p class="p">The antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antityrosinase activities of the essential oils and their main components (individual and mixture) were measured as described in the following sections. The tested concentration of the main component mixture was the sum of the individual component concentration, which was calculated as the tested essential oil concentration multiplied by the relative percentage of individual component in the essential oil. Moreover, the effect of the main component mixture on the activity of the EO was quantified as the contribution and calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Contribution (%) = (Act
  <sub class="sub">CC</sub>/Act
  <sub class="sub">EO</sub>) Ã— 100%
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Act
 <sub class="sub">CC</sub> and Act
 <sub class="sub">EO</sub> are the activities of the main component mixture and essential oil, respectively.
