<p class="p">The β-carotene/linoleic acid assay was performed using previous described methods [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. β-Carotene was dissolved in 0.2 mL of chloroform (1 mg/mL) and subsequently added to an emulsified mixture of linoleic acid (20 mg) in 200 mg of Tween20. Chloroform was evaporated in a vacuum at 40 °C for 5 min, and 50 mL of oxygenated distilled water was slowly added to the residue. The mixture was vigorously shaken to form an emulsion. A volume of 0.2 mL of various concentrations of the essential oils prepared in ethanol was added individually to 4.8 mL of the emulsion and subsequently incubated at 50 °C. The absorbance was measured at 470 nm after 3 h of incubation. A blank experiment containing all reagents except the test compound was measured at 470 nm immediately (0 h) and after 3 h of incubation. α-Tocopherol was also analyzed as a reference. Tests were conducted in triplicate. The given concentrations of the main components were measured using methods identical to those used for the essential oils. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the following formula: 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Inhibitory ratio of β-carotene/linoleic acid oxidation (%) 
  <break class="break"/>= [(Abs
  <sub class="sub">sample 3h</sub> − Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank 3h</sub>)/(Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank 0h</sub> − Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank 3h</sub>)] × 100%
  <label class="label">(5)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Abs
 <sub class="sub">sample 3h</sub> is the absorbance of the sample at 3 h, Abs
 <sub class="sub">blank 3h</sub> is the absorbance of the blank at 3 h, and Abs
 <sub class="sub">blank 0h</sub> is the absorbance of the blank at 0 h.
