<p class="p">To determine NO radical scavenging activity, the methods described by Marcocci et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] and Tsai et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-22-02154" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] were employed. Various concentrations of the essential oils dissolved in ethanol were mixed individually with 0.1 mL of Tween20 and 0.1 mL of sodium nitroprusside (100 mM) in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4), and additional phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) was added to yield a final volume of 1 mL. After 2.5 h of incubation at 20 °C, 0.25 mL of the mixture was added to 0.25 mL of Griess reagent and reacted for 10 min at 25 °C. The absorbance was determined at 540 nm. A blank experiment containing all reagents except the test compound was conducted on the basis of the same procedure. α-Tocopherol was also analyzed as a reference. Tests were conducted in triplicate. The given concentrations of the main components were measured using methods identical to those used for the essential oils. NO radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">NO radical scavenging ratio (%) = [(Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub> − Abs
  <sub class="sub">sample</sub>)/Abs
  <sub class="sub">blank</sub>] × 100%
  <label class="label">(6)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Abs
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of the blank and Abs
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub> is the absorbance of sample.
