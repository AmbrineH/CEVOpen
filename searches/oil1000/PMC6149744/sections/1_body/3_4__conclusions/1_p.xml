<p class="p">This is the first study analyzing the composition and bioactivities of ‘Mato Peiyu’ pomelo leaf essential oil. The compositions of ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil were evidently different from those of pomelo extracts reported in previous studies. ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil exhibited antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antipigmentation abilities, whose potency was determined by the main components, citronellal and citronellol. In most assays, the essential oil isolated through SD exhibited greater bioactivities compared with that obtained through SFME. This study revealed that ‘Mato Peiyu’ leaf essential oil exhibited the highest potency of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities among all bioactivity tests, suggesting the potential application of this essential oil in skin care. However, further study is required to confirm the antimicrobial activity of this essential oil on a significant strain number of the same bacteria. In addition, the safety of this essential oil including cytotoxicity and skin irritation and allergy requires further investigation.</p>
