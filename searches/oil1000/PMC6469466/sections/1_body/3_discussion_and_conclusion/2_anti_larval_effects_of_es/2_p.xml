<p class="p">Previous studies on 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> spp
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> have recognised that essential oils from plants belonging to this genus are very effective as botanical insecticides against several arthropods, including mosquitoes. 
 <italic class="italic">Piper tuberculatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Piper aduncum</italic> extracts were highly effective against larvae and engorged female 
 <italic class="italic">Rhipicephalus microplus</italic> ticks [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. nigrum</italic> exhibited insecticidal activity against the mosquito species 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. A study performed in the Brazilian Amazon comparing the methanol leaf and root extracts from several local plants, at the concentration of 500 μg/mL (500 ppm), reported 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> to have very good activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, showing 100% mortality after 24 h, similarly to our results, because of the phytochemical compound dillapiole [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Previous studies indicate a relevant potential for dillapiole to be used as a synergist compound in combination with pyrethroid-based insecticides to control 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>].
