<p class="p">However, it should be noted that costly and lengthy authorisation processes and the low environmental persistence of essential oils (and thus their effects) strongly limit the availability on the market of commercial insecticidal and repellent products. In addition, botanical larvicides (Bls) based on EOs may exhibit different efficacy depending on the post-application temperature of the environment, and this effect seems to be related to the non-uniform behaviour of their major constituents [

In order to provide clear and practical recommendations for application of such BIs, it is fundamental to understand the relationship between post-application temperature and the insecticidal efficacy of EOs. Therefore, further studies to investigate this aspect are needed.
