<p class="p">The present study shows findings of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> larvicidal activity of three essential oils extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O. quixos</italic> from Ecuador. These encouraging results should stimulate the search for additional selective, eco-friendly larvicidal compounds from Ecuador, where the flora exhibits a richness in diversity of aromatic plants with potential as natural extracts for control of mosquito vectors.
