<p class="p">Concerning the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. quixos</italic>, it has rarely been reported for its possible use against mosquito larvae as it is used mainly as a disinfectant, local anaesthetic, and anti-diarrheic infusion [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, the results reported here about 
 <italic class="italic">O. quixos</italic> (LD99 = 181.89 ppm) are consistent with findings on 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea cymbarum</italic>, showing that its strongest toxic effect was 100% mortality in 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> third age larvae at concentrations ≥30 ppm [
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Previous studies on the monoterpene 1,8-cineole, which is the main constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">O. quixos</italic> oil in this experiment, showed larvicidal activity toward the larvae of several mosquitos including 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>. The hydrophobicity of 1,8-cineole is probably the main factor responsible for toxicity towards larvae, because cuticle penetration is facilitated [
