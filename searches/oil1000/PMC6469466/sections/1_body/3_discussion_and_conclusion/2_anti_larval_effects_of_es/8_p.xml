<p class="p">Clearly, several biological insecticides based on Spinosad or 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">israelensis</italic> (B.t.i.), currently used for mosquito control, show greater efficacy than the oils tested in this study and in others. According to Bond et al. and Romi et al. [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], the larvicidal activity of Spinosad ranged between 0.01 and 0.02 ppm (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">99</sub> respectively at 24 h after treatment), and similar larvicidal activity was reported for B.t.i [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>].
