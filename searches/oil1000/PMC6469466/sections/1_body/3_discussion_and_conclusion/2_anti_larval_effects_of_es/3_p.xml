 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic> was already used as an insecticide against white fly 
 <italic class="italic">Aleurodicus cocois</italic> (Curtis, 1846) (Hemiptera, Aleyrodidae) [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Researchers carried out a study testing essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">O. americanum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> against larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and obtained LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 67 ppm and 60 ppm respectively, values very close to the 69.29 ppm of 
 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic> found here [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The literature indicates that eugenol, the main compound of 
 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic> essential oil studied in this research, exhibits larvicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> at the concentration of 44.5 ppm. Therefore, the larvicidal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic> essential oil against this mosquito species could be highly associated with the presence of eugenol [
