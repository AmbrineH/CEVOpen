<p class="p">The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic> was found to be rich mainly in eugenol (18.6%) and β-caryophyllene (17.0%), which is consistent with results reported by other authors [
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The constituents of the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">O. quixos</italic> showed 1,8-cineole as the most abundant compound (39.2%), confirming previous studies carried out in Ecuador [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Sabinene (6.5%) and α-pinene (6.3%) were also found to be relevant compounds in other research [
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, the most characteristic compounds such as 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde and β-caryophyllene were not found in the essential oil investigated in the present research. It is known that essential oils from the 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea</italic> genus usually show an high degree of chemodiversity, as reported in previous studies [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], and this could explain its unusually composition. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> was mainly characterised by dillapiole (48.2%), 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-ocimene (7.5%) and β-caryophyllene (17.0%), which is in line with other studies carried out on Ecuadorian 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> species [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>].
