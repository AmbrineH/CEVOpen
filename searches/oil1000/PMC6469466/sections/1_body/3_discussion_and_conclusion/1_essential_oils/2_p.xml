<p class="p">Concerning the essential oil (EO) yields, it is important to point out that even though the distillation yields were low, the implementation of such EOs is feasible, due to the easy reproduction of the studied species, both on a spontaneous and human-mediated basis. Moreover, at least in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic>, studies on elicitation techniques have been reported for similar species (
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> L.), showing promising results concerning the significant increase in total essential oil amount, using methyl salicylate, methyl jasmonate and chitosan as elicitors [
