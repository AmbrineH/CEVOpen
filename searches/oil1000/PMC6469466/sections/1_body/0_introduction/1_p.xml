 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> is known for its relevant worldwide role as the main vector of the yellow fever virus (YFV), for which a vaccine exists, and of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and other arboviruses, for which no vaccine is currently available. In particular, YFV remains a dramatic public health problem in the subtropical areas of South America and West Africa [

Recently, ZIKV, responsible for microcephaly, congenital nervous system malformations and Guillain-Barré syndrome has circulated in some areas of South-East Asia, tropical Africa and South America where outbreaks of infection have been well documented [
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. To take action against this mosquito vector, also able to transmit additional arboviruses heavily affecting humans, preventive control efforts are implemented worldwide and aim to reduce the impact of this mosquito species on human health.
