<p class="p">Concerning arboviral diseases, the risk of transmission is strongly linked to vector density and for this reason, density should be rapidly reduced by vector control activities. In general, the use of synthetic insecticides has been the basis of vector control in limiting mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, chikungunya (CHIK), dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV). However, over the past ten years, pesticide registration procedures aimed at minimising the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and on human health, and the widespread evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations [
