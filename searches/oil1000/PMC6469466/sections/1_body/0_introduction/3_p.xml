The use of plant extracts for insect control has a long historical tradition dating back 3000Â years, when extracts from aromatic plants were used as repellents against ectoparasites and anthelmintics, as well as to preserve harvested foods from pests. In the 20th century, studies related to the pesticide effects of essential oils gained momentum [
