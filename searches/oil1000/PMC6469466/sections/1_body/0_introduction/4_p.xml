<p class="p">In an effort to identify new larvicidal active ingredients (AIs) effective against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, the potential larvicidal effects of essential oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum campechianum</italic> Mill. (syn. 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum micranthum</italic> Willd.), 
 <italic class="italic">Ocotea quixos</italic> (Lam.) Kosterm. and 
 <italic class="italic">Piper aduncum</italic> L.
 <italic class="italic">,</italic> were tested 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> in this study. 
 <italic class="italic">O. campechianum</italic> is a plant species in the Lamiaceae family, widespread across Central and South America. Previous studies on essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> species showed promising results on the larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and also against other insect species [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">O. quixos</italic> is an evergreen tree in the Lauraceae family, native to Ecuador and Colombia. Species from the same genus, such as 
 <italic class="italic">O. cymbarum</italic>, showed a remarkable mortality effect on 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> is an evergreen, shade-tolerant, shrubby tree in the Piperaceae family, native to the West Indies and tropical America. Essential oils from the 
 <italic class="italic">Piper</italic> genus are recognised as having insecticidal effects against a large number of insects. In particular, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aduncum</italic> essential oil recorded very good activity against the 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>].
