<p class="p">A long-established laboratory colony of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (collected in Reynosa, Mexico, in 1998) was used as a susceptible strain for larvicidal bioassays. To allow hatching, eggs were placed in plastic trays (30 × 15 × l0 cm) containing 1 L of dechlorinated tap water. The larvae were reared in a climatic chamber at a temperature of 27 ± 1 °C, 80 ± 10% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14:10 h light:dark, until reaching adulthood. The bioassays were performed according to the procedure of the World Health Organization [
