<p class="p">Each essential oil was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) to prepare graded concentrations of tested material. Tests consisted of at least three replicates per concentration and were performed by serial dilutions of each oil (1000, 500, 250, 100, 75, 50, 37.5, 25, and 12.5 μg/mL). Batches of 25 late 3rd/early 4th-stage larvae were exposed to different doses of each oil in plastic cups, each containing 250 mL of dechlorinated water. Over 8000 larvae were tested (a mean of 2700 per oil). After 24 h of exposure, during which no food was given to the larvae, mortality was checked (considering both dead and moribund larvae), and expressed as percentage mortalities. Larvae were considered moribund or dead when they showed unnatural positions, tremors, in coordination, or rigor; they did not respond to stimuli such as probing with a needle; or they were incapable of rising to the surface of the water.</p>
