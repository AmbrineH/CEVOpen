<p class="p">A log-probit regression model for the three oils was obtained and toxicity was reported as lethal concentrations LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub>, representing the concentration in ppm necessary to cause 50% and 90% larval mortality, respectively, in 24 h. The larvicidal mortality was corrected by Abbott’s formula [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and an LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>, LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> regression equation, and the 95% confidence limit was calculated by using probit analysis [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Probit analysis was performed by using the software by Dr. Alpha Raj. M “Free LD
