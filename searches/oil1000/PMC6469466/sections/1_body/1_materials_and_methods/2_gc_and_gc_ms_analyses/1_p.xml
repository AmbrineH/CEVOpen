<p class="p">Compound identification was carried out by gas chromatography and gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC and GC–MS) analyses, and the relative peak areas for individual compounds were averaged. For the analysis, a ThermoQuest GC-Trace gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and a Varian FactorFour VF-5 ms poly-5% phenyl-95%-dimethylsiloxane column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness: 0.15 μm) were used. Operating conditions were as follows: injector temperature 250 °C, FID temperature 250 °C, carrier (Helium) flow rate 1 mL/min, and split ratio 1/20. The initial oven temperature was 55 °C and then increased to 100 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min, then to 250 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and then kept constant at 250 °C for 15 min. One microliter for each replicate was dissolved in CH

The chemical characterisation of essential oil compounds was performed by a Varian GC-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian MS-4000 mass spectrometer using electron impact and hooked to NIST 05 (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Mass Spectral Library. The conditions were the same as those described for GC analysis and the same column was also used. The mass spectroscopy conditions were as follows: ionisation voltage, 70 eV; emission current, 10 μAmp; scan rate, 1 scan/s; mass range, 29–400 Da; trap temperature, 150 °C, transfer line temperature, 300 °C. The essential oil compounds were characterised by comparing their relative retention times, KI, and the MS fragmentation pattern with those of other known essential oils, with pure compounds and by matching the MS fragmentation patterns and retention indices with the above-mentioned mass spectra libraries and with those in the literature [
