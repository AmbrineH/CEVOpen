<p id="Par11" class="p">Flame retardancy of PVC materials were investigated and the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value was showed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(d)</xref>. The results showed that LOI value of PVC materials containing 50 wt% DOP was 23.6%. LOI value of PVC-C was 26.8%, the value for PVC-A reached 34.7% with more propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P grafted onto PVC chains, which illustrated that flame retardancy of internally plasticized PVC was improved.
