 <sub class="sub">3</sub> will decrease glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymer materials by promoting the movement of main chains. In this study, internally plasticized PVC material were obtained by graft copolymerization. Propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P with flexible eater side chain groups will promote the movement of main chains of modified PVC, then decrease the Tg. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(a)</xref> shows the DSC curves. The DSC curves of PVC exhibited an exothermic peak approximately at 87.6 °C, which was corresponded to the Tg of PVC. All the modified PVC materials showed only one melting peak in the DSC curves, which illustrated that all propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P was grafted onto the chains of azide functionalized PVC. Tg of PVC-A, PVC-B and PVC-C was 51.4 °C, 67.1 °C and 76.9 °C, respectively. The results illustrated that Tg of PVC materials reduced when propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P was grafted onto the structure of azide functionalized PVC. Propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P decreased the der Waals’ force which could help to increase segment mobility, and then decreased the Tg of PVC efficiently.
