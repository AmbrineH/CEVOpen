<p id="Par10" class="p">In order to study the migration stability of the internal plasticizer, the migration behavior was investigated. The study found that there was not any weight loss for internally plasticized PVC materials after extraction experiments. This illustrated that propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P was grafted onto the polymer matrix. Extraction experiment of plasticizer for PVC plasticized with DOP was studied in our previous studies

 </sup>, the results showed that PVC-DOP blends lost plasticizer after the extraction experiments in four different solvents. The use of external plasticizer canâ€™t avoid migration of the PVC products. Therefore, the internal plasticizing method can extend the service life of PVC products.
