<p id="Par9" class="p">Flexibility of PVC-A, B, C was investigated and compared with PVC. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(a,b)</xref> showed the results. Tensile strength of PVC materials modified with propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P decreased and elongation at break increased gradually with more propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P grafted onto PVC matrix. Tensile strength and elongation at break for PVC was 36.0 MPa and 181.2%. The value of tensile strength and elongation at break for PVC-A reached 22.3 MPa and 326.1% respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5(c)</xref> shows the stress-strain curves of PVC materials, the internally plasticized PVC simultaneously exhibit much smaller stress and much larger strain during their deformation compared to PVC, because the propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P, as internal plasticizer, weakened the intermolecular friction forces between the PVC chains. The results illustrated that internally plasticized PVC materials were more flexible than PVC.
