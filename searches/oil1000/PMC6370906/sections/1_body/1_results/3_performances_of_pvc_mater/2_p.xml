 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(b)</xref> shows the TGA curves of PVC materials. All of the PVC materials have two thermal degradation stages. For PVC, dehydrochlorination of PVC occurred at around 200–350 °C and cyclization of the conjugated polyene sequences to form aromatic compounds and char residue occurred at above 350 °C. For internally plasticized PVC(PVC-A, B and C), as seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4(b)</xref>, which showed that all internally plasticized PVC materials were thermal stable under 200 °C and began to degrade at above 200 °C due to dehydrochlorination of PVC

 </sup>. Internally plasticized PVC materials exhibited less thermal stable with more propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P grafted onto chains of azide functionalized PVC, because more propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P was connected to the PVC-N
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> matrix, which made the polymer chains loose and easy to move. Thermal degradation of internal plasticizer (propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P) mainly occurred at the around 200–320 °C, which decreased thermal stability of PVC materials

 </sup>. Thermal degradation of PVC and propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P plasticizer produced many char residue. Metaphosphorous acid (HPO

 </sup>. The char residue of PVC, PVC-C, PVC-B and PVC-A was 5.83, 12.04, 12.63 and 20.65%. In fact, the char reside delayed the thermal degradation of modified PVC materials.
