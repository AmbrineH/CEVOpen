 </sup>. The peak of -N
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> groups disappeared slowly with more propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P grafted onto the chains of azide functionalized PVC, while the FT-IR speatra of ester groups at around 1760 cm

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CH

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chains. 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectra of modified PVC, multiple peaks at 1.0–1.2 ppm was corresponded to methyl protons, a single peak at 4.1 ppm was attributed to the methylene protons. The weak peaks at 5.5 ppm were corresponded to protons of olefin groups deriving from long chains of propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P. These data illustrated that propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P, as inherent parts of the polymer molecules, was grafted onto PVC-N
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> chains.
