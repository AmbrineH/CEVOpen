 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR spectra of products in deuterated chloroform were detected on an AV-300 measurement. Molecular weight of products in THF was conducted with an Waters GPC measurement. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was detected using a Netzsch TG209F1 measurement in nitrogen atmosphere. Five mg of samples were put into platinum pans and the temperature was increase from room temperature to 600 °C. Tg was characterized using a differential scanning calorimeter(DSC: 200 PC, Netzsch Co., Germany). The samples were detected under a nitrogen atmosphere over the temperature range of −40 to 120 °C. The heating rate was 20 °C/min. Migration stability of PVC materials was tested according to the references

 </sup>. The mechanical property of PVC and PVC-A,B,C were investigated with an E43.104 Universal Testing Machine (MTS Instrument Crop., China). Limiting oxygen index (LOI) tests were carried according to the standard of Plastics-Determination of burning behavior by oxygen index (GB/T 2406.1-2008. China) using JF-3 oxygen index measuring instrument (Nanjing Lei instrument, China).
