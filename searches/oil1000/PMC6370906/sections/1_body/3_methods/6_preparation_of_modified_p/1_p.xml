<p id="Par18" class="p">PVC-A, PVC-B and PVC-C was prepared respectively by dissolving the reactants(as seen from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) in DMF and introduced in round bottom flasks, which was stirred at 30 °C for two days under nitrogen protection. Internally plasticized materials were obtained after removing cuprous bromide, precipitating into water/methanol mixture and drying in a vacuum. The preparation of PVC materials was presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. PVC and PVC-A, B, C films were prepared via casting method using THF as solvent. Three grams of PVC and PVC-A, B, C was respectively dissolved 50 mL of THF and poured into molds. The polymer films were obtained after removing THF in vacuum drying box at 50 °C for 48 h. PVC films containing 50 wt% of DOP was also prepared using the same method.
