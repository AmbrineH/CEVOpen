<p id="Par3" class="p">Based on the above conclusion, the application of castor oil based flame retardant plasticizer grafting onto PVC matrix would suppress migration and improve its flame retardancy. We now report a method to prepare PVC materials with zero migration using castor oil derivative containing synergistic flame retardant groups of nitrogen and phosphorus. The new flexible PVC materials would have potential application value in making flame retardant PVC materials without migration.</p>
