<p id="Par12" class="p">Castor oil derivative containing containing synergistic flame retardant groups of nitrogen and phosphorus was grafted onto the chains of azide functionalized PVC. Chemical structure of the castor oil derivative was investigated. Tg of PVC materials reached 51.4 °C with more propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P grafted on chains of azide functionalized PVC. Thermal stability modified PVC materials is reduced compared with PVC at around 200–320 °C, but more thermal stable at around 320–600 °C. No migration was found after the extraction experiments, which indicated that propargyl ether THEIC-MR-P was covalently linked to the polymer matrix. LOI value of PVC materials modified with castor oil derivative containing THEIC and diethyl phosphate groups reached 34.7%, indicating that the castor oil derivative containing flame retardant groups enhanced flame retardancy of PVC materials. The obtained internally plasticized PVC materials will increase application value of PVC products with high flame retardancy and solvent extraction resistance requirements.</p>
