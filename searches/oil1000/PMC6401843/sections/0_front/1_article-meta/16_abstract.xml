 <p class="p">Pectin is a polymer with a core of alternating 
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>-1,4-linked 
  <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galacturonic acid and α-1,2-
  <sc class="sc">l</sc>-rhamnose units, as well as a variety of neutral sugars such as arabinose, galactose, and lesser amounts of other sugars. Currently, native pectins have been compared to modified ones due to the development of natural medicines and health products. In this review, the results of a study of the bioactivity of pectic polysaccharides, including its various pharmacological applications, such as its immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antibacterial, antioxidant and antitumor activities, have been summarized. The potential of pectins to contribute to the enhancement of drug delivery systems has been observed.
