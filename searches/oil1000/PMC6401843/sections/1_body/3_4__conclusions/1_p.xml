<p class="p">Over the past decade, a large number of published papers have dealt with various important bioactivities of pectic polysaccharides. Our review provides some theoretical recommendations for the further research of pectin according to the relationship between natural sources, chemical structures, biological activities, and practical applications in the food industry as well as pharmacology and different branches of medicine. The analysis of studies described here shows great insight into the structural requirements for pectin bioactivity and lack of detailed investigations at different levels for understanding the bioactive roles of pectins.</p>
