<p class="p">This review shows that different types of pectin may be used for drug delivery. Some of the physicochemical properties of pectin include: the ability of dissolution in basic environments, muco-adhesiveness, degradation stability against proteases and amylases of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and ease of forming gels in acid environments. Such properties contribute to its ability to target various drug delivery formulations such as beads, microspheres, microparticles, and pellets.</p>
