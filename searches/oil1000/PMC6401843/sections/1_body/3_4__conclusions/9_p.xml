<p class="p">To sum up, pectins are very interesting, and are a promising subject for further research in pharmacology and medicine application, largely due to their considerable availability from renewable sources and the non-toxic effect. They show high biological activity; however, there is still a long way to go into pectin action mechanism research. The current review can provide a guide to the development of new non-toxic industrial drugs on the basis of the ability of pectins to cure different diseases and enhance the state of health.</p>
