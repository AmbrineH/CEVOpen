<p class="p">The studies of the antimicrobial properties of pectins show a general tendency for the development of nanocomposites and nanoemulsions on their base. Both of them exhibit noticeable inhibitory effects, mainly against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. It is worthwhile to go more deeply into the study of existing composites, because the development of natural antimicrobials is a promising perspective.</p>
