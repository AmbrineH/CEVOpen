<p class="p">Hintzen et al. reported a new synthesis to obtain a completely S-protected thiomer. The unmodified pectin was compared with thiomer in vitro. The S-protected thiomer was produced by coupling pectin and an S-protected ligand, followed with the connection of the ligand 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-cysteine and 2-mercaptonicotinic acid by a disulfide exchange reaction. The surplus of 
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-cysteine was deleted by ion exchange chromatography, followed by coupling of the S-protected ligand to pectin as a model polymer backbone. The final product data revealed that the S-protection enhanced the stability of the thiomer in solution at high pH, as well as developed the cohesive and adhesive characteristics of the thiomer. Respectively, the S-protection seems to have the capacity to enhance the beneficial properties of thiomers for potential usage in mucoadhesive drug delivery systems and the development of liquid thiomer-based formulations [
