<p class="p">Newly oxidized pectin–gelatin–nanosilver (OP-Gel-NS) nanohydrocolloids and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride that were incorporated into the OP-Gel to produce OP-Gel-Cipro dressings were developed by Tummalapalli et al. To study the release of the drug from OP-Gel-Cipro dressings in vitro, a Franz diffusion cell was utilized. The histological testing indicated that OP-Gel-NS and OP-Gel-Cipro dressings displayed a high hydrophilicity and sustained antimicrobial activity. As mentioned above, nanoparticles support cell growth and proliferation, and contributed to the fast soar cicatrizing ability due to the hydrophilicity and antimicrobial nature [
