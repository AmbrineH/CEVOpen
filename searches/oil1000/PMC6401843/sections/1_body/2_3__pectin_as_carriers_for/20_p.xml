<p class="p">The study of a controlled-release gel matrix was conducted for powerful antibiotic enrofloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and keratinase with a base on a cryogel of polyvinyl alcoholâ€“pectin (PVA-pectin) to cure eschars and wounds. Keratinase was immobilized onto PVA-pectin cryogel patches, testing pectins with different esterification degrees as well as with pectins of various biopolymer concentrations to look for an optimum antibiotic and enzymatic release. Examined formulations of cryogels were found to be environment-friendly for enzymes and provide enzymatic activity. Such a system for the immobilization of enzymes is versatile regarding the absorbance of proteins while retaining their biological activity. The in vitro enrofloxacin release from PVA-pectin cryogel indicated the ability of keratinase to retard the antibiotic release. Thereby, it causes prolonged and controlled release [
