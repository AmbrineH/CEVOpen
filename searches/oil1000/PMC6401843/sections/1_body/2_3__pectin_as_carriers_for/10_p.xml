<p class="p">The potential applications of pectin with DE9 as a formulation with a degree of esterification (DE) of 9%, and DE31 as a formulation with a degree of esterification of 31%, were demonstrated as sustaining the floating of paracetamol with further in situ gelation in the stomach of gastric acidity-controlled rats with variety of pH (1.2â€“6.8) [

A substantial distinction regarding the in vivo gelling characteristics of the pectin DE9 and DE31 patterns was revealed by testing the stomach contents of gastric acidity-controlled rats at high pH intervals, following the oral administration of 1.5% (
