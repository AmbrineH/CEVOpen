<p class="p">The research on drugâ€“polymer interaction is absolutely vital, and covers the issue of the modulated release of the drug from the formulation. The study of domperidone (DOM) was performed to investigate releasing an in vitro drug delivery system consisting of a floating complicated structure, with pectin proving to be an ideal medium for delivering DOM. In the study, DOM floating beads were composed by means of an extrusion congealing method. The effect of presented formulations was estimated, and the activity of different types of compositions was observed. The major advantages of the system could comprise significant encapsulation efficiency, simplicity of fabrication, and continued and persistent drug release upwards of 12 hours [
