<p class="p">A new strategy for the preparation of cross-linked protein polysaccharide complex nanoparticles with unique stability in gastrointestinal environments and the prospective power of future utilization as agents for the oral administration of lipophilic nutrients was developed. In the study, protein–polysaccharide complex nanoparticles were produced from NaCas, zein, and three polysaccharides (carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), pectin, and gum arabic) via a pH and heating-induced electrostatic adsorption process. Curcumin was investigated as a model lipophilic nutrient to test the encapsulation and delivery usage. The study demonstrated that various types of polysaccharides exerted different influences on the complexation. The particle size of pectin–NaCas–zein nanoparticles was sharply decreased from 472 nm to 247 nm, while CMC–NaCas–zein (CCZ) and gum arabic–NaCas–zein nanoparticles remained much the same post-heating. Consequently, the polysaccharides influence on the physicochemical properties of complex nanoparticles such as the kinetic release, drying, colloidal stability, curcumin encapsulation efficiency. The cross-linked CCZ nanoparticles exhibited high stability in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, and redispersibility in water [
