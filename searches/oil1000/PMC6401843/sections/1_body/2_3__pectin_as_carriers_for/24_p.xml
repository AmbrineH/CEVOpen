The anti-anemic effects of new pectin complexes with (1) Na and Fe, and (2) Na, Ca, and Fe were studied in white rats with post-hemorrhagic anemia. As a result of the action of the complexes, an improvement in the state of the animals and the prevention of erythropoiesis disorders were observed. The anti-anemic effect of the complexes was manifested in doses equivalent to 25% or 50% of the daily iron norm, which was recommended in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with preparations based on ferrous sulfate [
