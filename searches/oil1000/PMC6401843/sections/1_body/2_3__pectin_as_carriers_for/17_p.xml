<p class="p">The research concerning the combination of pectin with an insufficient charge density alginate of substantial charge gravity was conducted to form the coat around zein nanoparticles. The substitution of 30% of pectin with alginate considerably enhanced the aggregation stability at an increased ionic strength at pH 5 to 7. The curcumin-loaded core–shell nanoparticles demonstrated more excellent radical disposing effects than curcumin dissolved in ethanol. Consequently, the curcumin loaded core–shell nanoparticles as functional food and liquors could double as pharmaceutical products for dietary purposes [
