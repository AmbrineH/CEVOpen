<p class="p">The group of authors used the methods of ionotropic gelation to develop a new hydrolyzed polyacrylamide-graft-sodium alginate (PAAmg-SA) and diclofenac sodium (DS)-loaded interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) beads of pectin. This research concerning the hydrolyzed PAAm-g-SA copolymer synthesized by free radical polymerization under the nitrogen atmosphere was continued with alkaline hydrolysis. The results of the investigation verified that hydrolyzed PAAm-g-SA and pectin cross-linked with Al
