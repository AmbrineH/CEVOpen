Then studies were conducted to determine the indomethacin-loading ratio, as well as various distributions of charge and CaCl

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and a ratio of 0.5% indomethacin demonstrated the significant entrapment activity. The investigation proved the enhanced encapsulation efficiency of orally administered drugs for a colon-targeted drug delivery due to charge modification of pectin [
