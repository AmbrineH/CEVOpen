<p class="p">Another strategy for the preparation of pectin-based hydrogels treated with a cross-linking agent such as Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> has been proposed [
 <xref rid="B143-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>]. The virtue of using Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> is to protect active components from the oxidation that is produced as a result of complexation with pectin, and form the hydrogel performing crossâ€“linking activity. Pectin macromolecules are obviously protected from stomach acidity in the course of digestion, while the macromolecules are cross-linked.
