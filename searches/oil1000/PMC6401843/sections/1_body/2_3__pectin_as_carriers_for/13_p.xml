<p class="p">The study [
 <xref rid="B131-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>] aimed to investigate the possibilities of complex formations between citrus pectin (CP) with antibiotic ceftriaxone (Ctx) and of the formation of model composite films. Polymer films that were capable of controlled ceftriaxone release have been prepared based on the citrus pectin mixture with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Kinetics of Ctx release into the surrounding solution was determined by measuring the solution absorbance at 245 nm. The decisive role of the supramolecular structure of the polymeric matrix on the filmsâ€™ transport properties has been demonstrated.
