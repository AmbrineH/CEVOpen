<p class="p">Polyelectrolyte complexes based on pectin are widely applied in drug delivery. The review [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] in great detail showed that pectin-based compositions could be utilized as bone replacement material or in tissue regeneration. Pectin/protein-based emulsions surpassed protein-based emulsions in stability. It is reported that pectin-based polymers were discovered as having a novel potential to create highly technological materials with enhanced characteristics. Casein–pectin as a multiple-unit drug delivery system was designed for the colonic drug delivery of two model drugs with different solubilities: acetaminophen (PCT) and indomethacin (IND) [
 <xref rid="B130-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]. The effect of chemical cross-linking and the drying method (spouted or spray-drying) on in vitro drug release, microcapsule digestibility, and structural integrity was investigated. The results showed that the drying method that was selected affected the product quality, and that the successful spouted bed-drying of microparticles depended on the mechanical strength of the particles and the chemical characteristics of the drug and the polymer. It was also shown that сasein–pectin microparticles seemed powerful to extend indomethacin release, and the casein–pectin interaction did not prevent an enzymatic attack on the polysaccharide. Acetaminophen-loaded microparticles were successfully processed by both the spouted-bed and spray-drying methods, but the casein–pectin formulation must be improved if water-soluble drugs are to be delivered more efficiently.
