<p class="p">The aim of the research [
 <xref rid="B140-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>] was to create active composite films based on pectin, and confirm the influence of clove ether as an additive on the mechanical and blocking properties of the produced films. Antimicrobial films were evolved by including various ranks of clove bud essential oil (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%) into the citrus pectin with the aim of modifying the functional characteristics of the films. The microbiological evaluation by an agar disc-diffusion test verified the antimicrobial effectiveness of pectin films against Gram-positive
