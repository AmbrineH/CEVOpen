<p class="p">Doxorubicin (DOX), a DNA intercalating agent, has been used as an effective chemotherapeutic for many types of solid tumors in breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, and bladder. However, its use is severely limited by its side effects. In order to decrease them, a drug delivery system was proposed. By using pectin (PEC) as a carrier material and doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug, the blank PEC nanoparticles (PEC-NPs) and the DOX-loading PEC nanoparticles (DOX-PEC-NPs) were prepared. The PEC-NPs promoted the anticancer activity of DOX by enhancing the intracellular drug uptake in the cancer cells. In vitro, the DOX-PEC-NPs demonstrated a stronger inhibitory rate in the test cancer cells than the DOX solution [
