<p class="p">The synthesis of pectin–silica gels to control the release of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) by means of low-methoxyl and high-methoxyl pectins and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a precursor was depicted. The combination pectin–TEOS and pectin–Ca–TEOS displayed the beads with the highest resistance. The hardness of the pectin silica beads influenced the drug release of the beads in simulated GIT, reaching up to 80%. Pectin–Ca–TEOS beads occurred to be stronger under mechanical compression, and in solutions simulated the intestinal environment drug release slower than that pectin–TEOS beads. FTIR demonstrated that hydrogen and covalent bonds between silica and pectin macromolecules were formed. By combination of the sol-gel and ionotropic gelation methods, various pectin-silica beads with mesalazine were synthesized. The in vitro drug release of pectin–silica beads is dependent on the beads’ hardness. It was concluded that the pectin–silica matrixes are promising regarding the elaboration of the controlled release of drug formulations [
