<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of nisin-loaded pectin–inulin particles as the main objective of the study was compared with nisin-loaded pectin particles. Inulin contributes to surge the effectiveness of nisin loading beside nisin–pectin particles. The antimicrobial activity of nisin-loaded pectin–inulin particles was influenced by the extent of pectin esterification. The significant activity corresponds to a low or zero degree of pectin esterification, while the particles of a more considerable degree of pectin esterification by contrast decreased the antimicrobial activity [
