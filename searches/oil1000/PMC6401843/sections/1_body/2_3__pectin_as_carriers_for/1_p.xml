<p class="p">The successful treatment of different diseases is a direct result of effective carrier systems for the delivery of therapeutic agents or imaging agents. The bioavailability, safety, and effectiveness are the essential requirements for perfect carriers. The nontoxicity, targeting ability to a particular site, stability, and non-immunogenicity are also very crucial. The incorporation of a drug into a polymer matrix enables prolonging its action and optimizing pharmacokinetics. Moreover, the use of polymer film as an immobilization matrix facilitates the targeted delivery of the drug. The review [
 <xref rid="B118-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>] focused on advanced carriers based on natural biomacromolecules for drug delivery. Biomacromolecules exploded as carriers; they comprise proteins (transferrin, albumin, collagen, lipoproteins, keratin, and silk fibroin) and polysaccharides (hyaluronic acid, chitosan, heparin, cyclodextrin, and pectin). Due to the remarkable properties for pharmacology, such as ease of dissolution in common environments, mucus, and the capacity to produce gels in acids, pectins are of promising fundamental and applied interest [
