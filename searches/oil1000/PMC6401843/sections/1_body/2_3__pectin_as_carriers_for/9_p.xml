<p class="p">Another investigation [
 <xref rid="B127-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>] revealed the suitability of pectin–chitosan hydrogels for use as drug carriers, as well as a control mechanism for release patterns. In vitro drug-release studies verified that a lower percentage of pectin caused slower release rates due to the smaller mesh size that was produced by intense interactions between the polyelectrolytes. The release decelerated if the aggregate polymer concentration increased. Negatively-charged pectin interacting with chitosan, which is positively charged, generates an electrostatic effect, lessening the hydrogel network’s mesh size. The ionic strength of the phosphate buffer saline solutions did not affect the hydrogels’ characteristics. Drug-release studies showed a persistent release of three model drugs (mesalamine, curcumin, and progesterone) over 24 hours in a physiological environment [
