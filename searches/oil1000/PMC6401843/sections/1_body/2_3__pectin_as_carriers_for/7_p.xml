<p class="p">Research on the efficiency of targeted functionalized nanoparticles in determined cells was conducted on the ligand–receptor interaction between glycoprotein CD44 and hyaluronan (HA) as a model. The cytotoxicity of the hyaluronan–cisplatin conjugate nanoparticles (HCNPs) was estimated. HCNPs were molded in Eudragit S100-coated pectinate/alginate microbeads (PAMs) by means of a polyelectrolyte multilayer-coating technique and an electrospray method in aqueous solution. Therefore, they conjugated HA–cisplatin into nanoparticles, and in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, the release pattern of the HCNPs from Eudragit S100-coated PAMs was evaluated in vitro. The obtained data confirmed the potential function of Eudragit S100-coated HCNP–PAMs as carriers for colon-specific drug delivery [
