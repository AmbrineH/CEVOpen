<p class="p">An emergent ecologically-friendly method to synthesize hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles utilizes naturally renewable pectin as a matrix. The impact of pectin concentration on the morphology, particle size, crystalline behavior, and purity of the as-synthesized HAP nanoparticles has been determined. The soaking of in vitro synthesized nanoparticles in simulated body fluid for several days revealed that the HAP nanoparticles that had been treated with the prickly pear peels-derived pectin surpassed the nanoparticles obtained without pectins in antimicrobial activity against
