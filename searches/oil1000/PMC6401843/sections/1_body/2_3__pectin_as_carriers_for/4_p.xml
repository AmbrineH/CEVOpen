 <xref rid="B122-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>] was to analyze powder-based compositions for the nasal administration of tacrine hydrochloride. The anti-Alzheimer drug was encapsulated in mucoadhesive microparticles based on chitosan/pectin polyelectrolyte complexes. Microparticles were produced by methods of spray-drying followed by lyophilization and direct spray-drying, and their morphology, size, and physicochemical characteristics were investigated. The results of the study demonstrated the possible application of chitosan/pectin polyelectrolyte complexes in the composition of mucoadhesive microparticles, obtaining various functional features. The water uptake and tacrine hydrochloride permeation were influenced by the chitosan/pectin molar ratio. Drug-release studies were performed in vitro using Vision Classic 6 Dissolution Tester (Hanson, CA, USA) [
