<p class="p">The calcium gel capsules were formed by various pectins as low-methyl pectin, amidated pectin, and high-methyl pectin. The gel capsules with live probiotic 
 <italic class="italic">L. casei</italic> were coated with chitosan. The impact of pectin concentration on the production of gel beads was firstly evaluated. The extrusion of these solutions into 0.15 M of CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> determined the different shapes of the formation of gel beads, and was related to the type of pectin that was used and the concentration of its solution. In vitro experiments were also carried on with the encapsulated probiotic bacteria to indicate the protective effect of chitosan coating for the transit of live bacteria through the gastrointestinal tract [
