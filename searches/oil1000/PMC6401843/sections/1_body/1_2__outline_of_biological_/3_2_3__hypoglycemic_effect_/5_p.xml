In addition, the activation of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β/GS insulin signaling pathway and the modulation of basic hepatic glycogen metabolism-linked enzymes containing glucokinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase were indicated as the therapeutic mechanisms of FPLP. The study verified the theory that the hypoglycemic effect of FPLP could be determined by the enhancement of hepatic glycogen metabolism [
