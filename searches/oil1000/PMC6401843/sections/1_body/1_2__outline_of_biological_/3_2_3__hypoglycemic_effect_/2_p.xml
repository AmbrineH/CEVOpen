 <xref rid="B36-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] was conducted to study the anti-diabetic effect of citrus pectin in diabetic rats and the potential benefits of citrus pectin to produce anti-diabetic effects in cases of T2DM caused by a low-dose streptozotocin and a fat-laden diet. The first sign of metabolic diseases associated with T2DM proved to be insulin resistance. The oral glucose tolerance test can imitate the postprandial hyperglycemia state, presenting essential facts about the impact of insulin on glucose utilization [

 <xref rid="B39-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Citrus pectin reduced fasting blood glucose levels, benefited hyperlipidemia, and refined hepatic glycogen content glucose tolerance in the diabetic rats. Citrus pectin modulated the expression of the basic proteins in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which could have influenced the enhancement of insulin sensitivity in the diabetic rats, possibly by signifying the anti-diabetic effect of citrus pectin [
