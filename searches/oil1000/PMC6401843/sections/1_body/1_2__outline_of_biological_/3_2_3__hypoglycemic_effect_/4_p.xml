 <italic class="italic">Panax ginseng</italic> is the most widely used herb to cure diabetes. A large number of studies in animals and humans confirmed its hypoglycemic activity. The pectic polysaccharides were produced from red ginseng (GPR, steamed ginseng at 100 °C) white ginseng (GPW), and steamed ginseng (steamed ginseng at 120 °C, GPS) by means of conjunction of ion-exchange, water extraction, and gel permeation chromatographies. These pectic polysaccharides were segregated into two fractions, which were indicated as HG-rich and RG-I-rich pectins based on a combination of monosaccharide composition and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C NMR analysis. The amount of Gal and Ara in GPS decline acutely with the processing temperature; nevertheless the galacturonic acid (GalA) content in GPS sharply surged in comparison with that in GPR and GPW. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that GPS produced substantial antioxidant anti-hyperglycemic activities in alloxan-induced diabetic mice, and the influence increased with the processing temperature [
