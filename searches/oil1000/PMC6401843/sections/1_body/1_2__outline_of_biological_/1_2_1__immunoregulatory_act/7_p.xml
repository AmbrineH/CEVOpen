 <italic class="italic">Lycium ruthenicum</italic> Murr., serves as a source plant that is distributed mainly in China [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Traditional medicine utilized its fruit to cure hypertension, heart disease, and climacteric syndrome. Recently, some investigations indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">L. ruthenicum</italic> revealed a variety of pharmacological properties, including antioxidation, antifatigue, and hypoglycemic activity [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The structural features of a pectin isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">L. ruthenicum</italic> fruit have been investigated, and its immunomodulatory activity has been evaluated in vitro. The crude polysaccharides have been isolated by water extraction from the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">L. ruthenicum</italic> and purified. The 
 <italic class="italic">L. ruthenicum</italic> pectin was obtained in a 0.086% yield based on the dried weight of the plant powder and contained 97.5% carbohydrate, according to the phenol sulfuric acid test. It was composed of galacturonic acid, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, and galactose in the molar ratio of 4.7:1.0:2.2:0.5:1.2. Structural research exhibited that the backbone of pectins comprises Î±-1,4-linked HG rarely alternated with RG-I parts. As well, the Branford assay demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">L. ruthenicum</italic> pectin contains 2.3% of protein. Glycine was the dominate amino acid, and other amino acids such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serine are present in abundance. Nitric assay demonstrated the stimulation of macrophages due to the pectin activity, which can be estimated by the Griess method. It is reported that the 
 <italic class="italic">L. ruthenicum</italic> polysaccharide inhibits the lipopolysaccharide induced nitric oxide (NO) production and the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and suppresses the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages [
