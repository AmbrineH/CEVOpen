Meanwhile, immunosuppressants are used to suppress the activity of lymphoid cells in inflammation, allergies, transplantation, and the treatment of autoimmune diseases. As immunostimulants, immunosuppressants are obtained from the tissues of animals and plants by biosynthesis, using genetic engineering and chemical synthesis methods [
