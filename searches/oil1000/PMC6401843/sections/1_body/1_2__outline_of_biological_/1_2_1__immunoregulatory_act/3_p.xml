<p class="p">The immunomodulatory activities of the oligomer fractions are still observed in the studies of the enzymatic digestion of pectins, which also show the value of the backbone of pectins. The carbohydrate chain of pectins determines immunosuppressive activity. It was found that pectins containing more than 80% of galacturonic acid residues suppress the activity of macrophages and inhibit the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. In addition, the branched region of the pectin macromolecule mediates the stimulation of phagocytosis and the increased production of antibodies [
