 <italic class="italic">Sambuci flos</italic>, also known as elderflower, is conventionally used to cure different diseases that are connected with the immune system, such as for instance chill, influenza, or pyrexia. Giang Thanh Thi Ho et al. received 50% ethanol, 50 째C, and 100 째C aqueous extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">S. nigra</italic> flowers that had intense fixing activity and macrophage stimulation effect [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The monosaccharide compositions of the fractions that were acquired as a result of anion exchange chromatography from 50% ethanol, 50 째C, and 100 째C water extracts have shown monosaccharides that are typical for pectins, including: arabinose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, galactose, xylose, glucose, and mannose. The ratio between the monomers of different fractions, which varied considerably, was estimated, and a profound analysis of the original polysaccharide structures, as well as linkage analysis, was carried out. Structural alteration such as the removal of arabinose and ester impact the additional fixating and stimulating activities of macrophages. The nutritional significance of elderflower is growing due to the biologically active polysaccharides, which perhaps contribute to its high immunomodulating characteristics [

The isolated fraction showed no toxicity in the examined concentrations in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the brine shrimp assay, registering no toxicity toward these cells. In vitro tests demonstrated that high-molecular RG-I-containing polysaccharides expose the greatest dose-dependent fixation of complement and macrophage-stimulating effects. The biological activity of these polysaccharides surpasses the biological effect of the corresponding polysaccharides after the equal procedure of isolation from the elderberries [
