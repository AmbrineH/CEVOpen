<p class="p">Lemon pectins were studied in the research by Vogt et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Pectins with different degrees of methyl esterification, such as 30% (30DM), 56% (56DM), and 74% (74DM) that were purchased from CP Kelco were used to investigate the impact of backbone chain length and the methyl esterification degree of pectins on Toll-like receptors. The influence of pectin with various degrees of methyl esterification on intestinal barrier function in vitro was monitored, as pectins modulate the intestinal barrier, having important implications for human health [

It has been found that the physical chemical properties of lemon pectin, susch as the degree of methyl esterification (DM; high DM pectins activating Toll-like receptors are much more pronounced than low DM pectins) and the extent of polymerization, can influence their immunostimulatory characteristics, and accordingly can be important when utilizing pectins to enhance immune status [
