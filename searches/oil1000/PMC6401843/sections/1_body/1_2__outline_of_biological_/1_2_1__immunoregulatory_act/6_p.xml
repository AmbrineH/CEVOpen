 <italic class="italic">Terminalia macroptera</italic> Guill. and Perr. is a tree that originated in West Africa. The parts of this plant such as its leaves and stem bark have been used traditionally for medical purposes to cure cough and sores, hepatitis, and tuberculosis, as well as relieve pain. The roots are utilized against gonorrhea and different infectious diseases, including Helicobacter pylori-connected illnesses. The pre-extraction of the cells conducted twice over with 96% ethanol and 50% ethanol–water at 70 °C and following thorough the extraction with distilled water at 50 °C enabled extracting lipophilic and low molecular weight compounds. Then, the high molecular weight fractions isolated from the stem bark, root bark, and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">T. macroptera</italic> were filtrated, and then concentrated, dialyzed, and lyophilized. The three most abundant fractions possess the characteristics of pectic polysaccharides, consisting of hairy regions (RG-1) and smooth regions. The inhibition of lysis, which the test samples induced, was estimated, at 415 nm. A pectic polysaccharide with high activity produced by aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Biophytum umbraculum</italic> was utilized in the capacity of a positive control. Using these data, the calculations of the concentration of test samples producing a 50% inhibition of lysis (ICH
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was conducted by means of a dose-response graph. A low ICH
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> degree means a soaring complement fixation activity. These studies revealed that the stem bark, leaves, and root bark of
