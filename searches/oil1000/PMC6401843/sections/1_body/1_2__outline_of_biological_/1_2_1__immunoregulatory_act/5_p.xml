 <italic class="italic">Artemisia afra</italic> is a plant that is used traditionally in South Africa against a variety of diseases such as internal worm infestation, cough, cold, fever, colic, headache, loss of appetite, pain in the ear, and malaria [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The research studies of the polysaccharides from 
 <italic class="italic">A. afra</italic> demonstrate that its water-soluble fraction includes biologically active polysaccharides that exhibit immunomodulating effect. Prior to the extraction of the polysaccharides, the plant material was extracted with organic solvents to remove lipophilic and low molecular weight substances. The residue was then subjected to extraction with 50% ethanol in water, followed by extraction with water at 50 °C and finally water of 100 °C. All of the fractions were subjected to ultrafiltration with a cut-off of five kD. The fractions that were rich in carbohydrates and with similar migratory behavior were pooled, dialyzed, freeze-dried, and analyzed for bioactivity. All of the fractions have high contents of arabinose and galactose, indicating the presence of arabinogalactans, which are polysaccharides that are commonly present in pectins as side chains to the main core. The most striking feature among these is the relatively high amount of xylose present, which may have an impact on the bioactivity. It is known that the polysaccharides with the high bioactivity that is found in 
 <italic class="italic">Lessertia frutescence</italic> also have the feature of xylose units linked to the galacturonic acid chain [

 <xref rid="B14-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. A main core of the polysaccharides consists of a rhamnogalacturonan backbone connected with longer chains of homogalacturonan.
