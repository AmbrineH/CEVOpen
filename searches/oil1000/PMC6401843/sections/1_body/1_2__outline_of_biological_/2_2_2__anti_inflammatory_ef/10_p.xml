<p class="p">The profound analysis of the polysaccharides structures of Cabernet Franc (WCF), Cabernet Sauvignon (WCS), and Cabernet Sauvignon Blanc (WSB) wines were performed, and their anti-inflammatory properties were studied in vitro by Bezerra et al. According to their chemical composition, the polysaccharides of WCF, WCS and WSB comprised mannan, type II arabinogalactan, and traces of type II rhamnogalacturonan and type I rhamnogalacturonan. The conducted research shows that the pooled fractions of WCF, WCS, and WSB and fractions with extracted polysaccharides produced an anti-inflammatory effect on the LPS-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells in vitro. These effects were promoted by reducing inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and the mediator inflammatory (NO) [
