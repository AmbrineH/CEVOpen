<p class="p">Popov et al. has studied the anti-inflammatory activity of citrus pectins in vivo after oral administration in mice [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Three models of inflammation were used: cytokine production by blood leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide, acetic acid-induced colitis, and endotoxin shock. The results of the study demonstrate that low methyl-esterified citrus pectin inhibits local and systemic inflammation, while pectin with a higher degree of esterification can inhibit intestinal inflammation. These findings verify that chemical features influence the physiological properties of pectins. The identification of a quantity of low methyl-esterified pectin chains in plant-based food would explain the wholesome qualities of the diet [
