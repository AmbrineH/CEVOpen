<p class="p">The in vitro activities of acetylated pectin (OP) extracted from cacao pod husks, its fractionally de-esterified and de-acetylated form (MOP), and a commercial homogalacturonan on peritoneal macrophages in mice were studied. The results showed that a polysaccharide with better capacity than its native form to activate macrophages to a cytotoxic phenotype was produced after the deacetylation and de-esterification of pectin isolated from cacao pod husk. MOP seems to have potential medical application, which contributes to the reduced susceptibility to microbial infection, in addition to antitumor activity. The chemically modified biopolymers form an enhanced product with a new range of usage [
