 <italic class="italic">Sedum dendroideum</italic> is succulent plant that has been utilized to cure inflammatory diseases. Two pectic polysaccharides from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">S. dendroideum</italic> were isolated [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The studies have shown the influence of pectic polysaccharides on the secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. If a pro-inflammatory agent was available, these polysaccharides demonstrate an anti-inflammatory activity, precluding the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and supporting the secretion of an anti-inflammatory cytokine. From the findings, it was suggested that polysaccharides might cause the anti-inflammatory characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">S. dendroideum</italic> extracts, warranting the common application of this plant for curing inflammation disorders, ulcerations, and sores. This activity is also monitored for other polysaccharides that exhibit pro-inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory effects, and as a result, could contribute an immunomodulatory function [
