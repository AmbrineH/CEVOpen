 <xref rid="B19-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Starfruit is an esculent tropic fruit that is commonly consumed as fruit juice, and has demonstrated a wide range of pharmacological activities. Polysaccharides from starfruit were segregated with boiling water, yielding the aqueous fraction, which after neutralization with acetic acid (HOAc), dialysis against tap water, and deionization with cation exchange resin resulted in some fractions. It was indicated as a substituted galacturonan by monosaccharide, methylation, gel permeation chromatography, and 2D NMR analyses. The effect of one of the fractions on the nocifensive behavior caused by the intraplantar injection of formalin in mice was estimated. This polysaccharide demonstrated antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties in a formalin model, suggesting that it has potential health benefits, and may be useful in therapeutic intervention for the management of inflammatory pain [
