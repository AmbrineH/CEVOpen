 <italic class="italic">I. paraguariensis</italic>), polysaccharide was extracted from leaves of this plant, and its chemical structure was defined as RG-I. An anti-inflammatory effect of RG-I could be verified by its capacity to reduce the tissue expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and a possible subsidiary ability to treat sepsis [
