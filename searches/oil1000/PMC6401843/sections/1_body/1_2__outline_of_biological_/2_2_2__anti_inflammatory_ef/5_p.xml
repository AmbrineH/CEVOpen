 <italic class="italic">S. fruticosa</italic> (SFP) can be a new source of an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent or antioxidant with promising merits for healthy nutrition and therapy [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Isolated pectic polysaccharides from 
 <italic class="italic">S. fruticosa</italic> have a significant potential in antioxidant activity, comprising lipid peroxidation, free radical scavenging, and decreased effect. What is more, SFP decreases carrageenan-induced edema within three to four hours. These effects of SFP can be explained by the considerable galacturonic acid content and rather low degree of esterified acidic groups and molecular weight [
