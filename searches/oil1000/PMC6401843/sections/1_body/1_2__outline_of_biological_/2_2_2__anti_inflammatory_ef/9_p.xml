<p class="p">The inherent activation power of a pectic fraction extracted from sweet pepper fruits to cause cytokine secretion by THP-1 macrophages and regulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro-inflammatory response has been investigated. The structural modifications in the tested pectin were submitted, and its biological activities were compared with a native fraction to analyze the structure–function relationship. To sum up, native pectin and modified pectin at the highest concentration (300 μg/mL) possessed the inherent activation ability to control the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 secretion by THP-1 macrophages, but the chemical differences of these pectins facilitate an explicit influence on stimulation. On the other hand, due to LPS availability, the anti-inflammatory activity of native pectin occurred by decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory and soaring anti-inflammatory cytokines, concurrently reducing the TNF-α/IL-10 and IL-1β/IL-10 proportions. Native pectin might serve as an immunomodulator, in spite of the absence of a pure pro-inflammatory effect [
