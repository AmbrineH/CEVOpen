<p class="p">The structural features of pectic polysaccharides extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Ulmus pumila</italic> L. (PPU) were studied to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of PPU and selenized-PPU (Se-PPU) using RAW 264.7. It was shown that 2% and 4% of Se-PPU reduced LPS-induced NO production by inhibiting the protein expression of iNOS in RAW 264.7 cells [
