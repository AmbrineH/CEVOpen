<p class="p">The study [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] demonstrated that the Firmicutes species 
 <italic class="italic">Eubacterium eligens</italic> was an important, specialist degrader of diet-derived pectins in the human colon that produces a constitutive pectate lyase. The culture supernatant of this bacterium intensively promotes the synthesis of anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It may possess powerful anti-inflammatory activities in vivo, and thus should be providently regarded as a possible next-generation probiotic. Its components could identify it as a structurally complex and chemically heterogeneous family of molecules pectins, thus providing useful fractional degradation products that may cause various prebiotic specificities and potential compared with native plant pectins. For instance, some 
 <italic class="italic">Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> strains, although restricted to reclaimed pectin, jointly with 
 <italic class="italic">E. eligens,</italic> that have been grown on a purified pectic-oligosaccharides revealed compound could present a successful prebiotic approach for promoting these potentially beneficial Firmicutes species. Alternatively, a similar choice of pectin-utilizing species could be made among the Bacteroidetes, contributing to great interest in the consequences of developing a number of species within the genus. Recently, the research by Chung et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] demonstrated the application of apple pectin as a sole carbohydrate substrate to human colonic microbial communities in anaerobic continuous culture with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine the most promising competitors. This presented stimulation of six various Bacteroides spp., whereas among the Firmicutes, just 
 <italic class="italic">E. eligens</italic> were developed. Analysis of these findings demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">E. eligens</italic> surged to an average of 15% of total 16S rRNA gene sequences in the pectin-fed communities, compared with only 1% in the fecal inoculum.
