<p class="p">A simple green approach to synthesize Ag nanoparticles (NPs) using citrus pectin as the reducing and capping agent has been developed. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed the pectin coated on the surface of Ag NPs. The Ag NPs exhibited good antibacterial activities toward Gram-negative

 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. It has been established that the Ag NPs could potentially be antibacterial agents in biomedical applications. This work suggested a new strategy for the highly efficient use of citrus pectin in the future [
