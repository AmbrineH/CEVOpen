Batches of the pectin metal complexes (0.25 g, 0.5 g, 0.75 g, and 1 g) were weighed and joined with meat-peptone agar (MPA) (10 mL) for bacteria and Sabouraud medium in agar (10 mL) for fungi. The composition effect demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of PGNaCo and PGNaNi (concentration 10%) against the test microorganisms. PGNaCo absolutely inhibited the development of the bacterial test strains and yeast-like fungus 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>, and partially that of mold fungus 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic>, while its concentration decreased from 10% to 7.5%. PGNaCo remained inactive against
