<p class="p">The surface of the cellulose nanofibrous mats was exploited to deposit negatively-charged pectin and positively charged lysozyme (LZ) alternately by the layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique. The nanofibrous mats covered by 10.5 LZ/pectin bilayers with LZ on the outmost layer revealed the most significant inhibitory effect toward
