<p class="p">Biodegradable materials based on pectin, pectin-oleate, pectin-linoleate, and pectin palmitate were observed due to the antimicrobial effect against a number of bacterial strains, including 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Pectin-linoleate and pectin-oleate demonstrated great capacity to suppress the growth of the selected microorganisms by 50â€“70%. They have the best antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. Water resistance and the protective properties of the polysaccharide were increased by chemically modified pectin, thus generating and deriving a bio-based material for new applications, such as for instance the safe way to package active food products [
