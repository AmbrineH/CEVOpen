<p class="p">The anti-cancer effect of sweet potato pectin on colon cancer cells after ultrasonic modification was assessed in order to investigate its possible use in anti-cancer therapy. It was shown that sonicated pectin exhibited higher cell anti-proliferation compared to native pectin. Overall, sonication improved pectin anticancer capacity, and could offer an effective, affordable, and easily scalable means of biofunctional pectin production for the pharmaceutical sector. Moreover, sonication could be applied in the modification of other polymers to achieve certain characteristics [
