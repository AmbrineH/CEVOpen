<p class="p">Sugar beet pectin extracts presenting various structures of pectin showed high anti-proliferative action against colon cancer cells. The alkali treatment of pectin surged the antitumor activity of sugar beet pectin due to an apoptosis promotion. Alkali treatment decreased the DE and increased the ratio of RG-I to HG. Thus, the RG-I/HG backbone could possess biological activity, because the influence on cells remains, even after the elimination of the side-chains of neutral sugars. However, the galactan and arabinan side-chains improve bioactivity [
