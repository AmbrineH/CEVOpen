 <italic class="italic">Lonicera japonica</italic> is the conventional remedy for curing sores, infection diseases, exopathogenic wind-heat, wounds, and furuncles. Homogenous RG-I polysaccharides were obtained and purified from the flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">L. japonica</italic>, and their structure and influence on the activity of pancreatic cells were investigated. The polysaccharide was described as an RG-I backbone. Its monosaccharide composition presented galacturonic acid, rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose. The polysaccharide demonstrated high inhibition regarding the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell BxPC-3 and PANC-1, while a weak cytotoxicity of the live cells was observed. The study suggests that pectic polysaccharide from flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">L. japonica</italic> could be a powerful novel medicine for pancreatic cancer [
