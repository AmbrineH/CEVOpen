<p class="p">Three polysaccharides (PLE-0, PLE-I, and PLE-II) were isolated from persimmon leaves, and their antitumor and antimetastatic activities were analyzed. Both PLE-0 and PLE-II considerably amplified natural killer (NK) cells, which caused cytotoxicity toward lymphoma tumor cells and suppressed the lung metastasis that was promoted by colon carcinoma cells. PLE-II failed to stop tumor metastasis due to the depletion of NK cells, showing that NK cells play a major role in regulating the antimetastatic effect of PLE-II. Besides PLE-0 being the crude polysaccharide, it also induces anti-cancer and immunomodulatory activity [
