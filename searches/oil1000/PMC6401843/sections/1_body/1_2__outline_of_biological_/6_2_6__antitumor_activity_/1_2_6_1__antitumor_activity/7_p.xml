<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> L. from the Tibetan plateau has been traditionally utilized as medicinal food. Water-soluble polysaccharide (HRWP-A) was isolated and separated by Hailiang Wang et al. from 
 <italic class="italic">H. rhamnoides</italic> berry, occurring as a mixture of glucan and HG, with high antifatigue activity [
 <xref rid="B98-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Structural analysis, as well as the immunological and antitumor activity assays, were conducted thoroughly [
 <xref rid="B99-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] to describe the structural features, and thus investigate the possible pharmaceutical application of polysaccharides from the 
 <italic class="italic">H. rhamnoides</italic> berry. An antitumor effect study indicated the capacity of HRWP-A to inhibit the Lewis lung carcinoma development in tumor-bearing mice. Further testing verified that immunostimulating properties can influence the antitumor effect of HRWP-A due to improvements in the lymphocyte proliferation soaring macrophage activities and providing NK cell activity and cytotoxicity T-lymphocyte (CTL) in tumor-bearing mice.
