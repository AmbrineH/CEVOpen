<p class="p">Maxwell et al. have assessed pectin from different sources (potato, sugar beet, larch, and citrus) for effects against colon cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B92-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. RG-I extracts of potato pectin lowered the proliferation of colon cancer cells by the alteration of dose. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene expression that had been diminished by RG-I and ICAM1 expression and influenced by siRNA contributed to the reduction of cell proliferation, developing a new mechanism for the powerful antitumor effect of pectin. HG component and neutral sugar side-chains could exert significant action on the anti-proliferative activity. The impact of four potato pectins on human colon cancer cells and the probable factors that were responsible for the effects were studied individually [
 <xref rid="B93-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. The research data verified the association between the RG-I domain and the anti-cancer effects of this pectin.
