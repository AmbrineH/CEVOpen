<p class="p">The pectic polysaccharide from apple can induce the death of cancer cells death and suppress the growth of tumors in vivo, as Delphi and Sepehri described. They compared the activity of apple pectin in the form of pectic acid and modified pectin toward cancer metastasis. The results verified that pectic acid revealed apoptotic activity, and was able to inhibit breast tumor cells growth in vivo. These studies established the in vivo reduction of tumor growth and size due to the stimulation of apoptosis and supposed suppressing angiogenesis, wherein animal body weight wasnâ€™t changed considerably [
