<p class="p">It is known that the structure of pecti—Å polysaccharides (including size, composition, and branching pattern) can vary, depending on their source. The pectin structure is reported to influence its bioactivity. The structure modification of pectin can be thermal, chemical, or enzymatic. The last one occurs during the natural processes of fruit ripening by the coordinated action of endogenous pectinolytic enzymes, including the fractional depolymerization of pectin to a smaller size with reduced branching, while an interim stage of fruit ripening takes place. It was shown that papaya pectin obtained at various ripening stages contributes to the death of cancer cells. Ripening processes were followed by the depolymerization of pectic polysaccharides, comprising arabinogalactans, RGs, HGs, and their modified forms. The pectin being extracted from the intermediate ripening stage of papaya is definitely reduce the cancer cell viability. Besides, culture wound closing is delayed in three forms of immortalized cancer cell lines. The data can be explained by the peculiarities of papaya pectins on the third day of harvesting, such as the disturbed collaboration between the extracellular matrix proteins and cancer cells, which improves cell detachment and develops apoptosis/necroptosis. The presence and the branch of the arabinogalactan type-II structure impacts the anti-cancer effect of papaya pectin [
