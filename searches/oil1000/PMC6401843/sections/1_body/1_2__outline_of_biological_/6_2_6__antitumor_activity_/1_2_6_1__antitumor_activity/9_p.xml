<p class="p">It was shown that citrus pectin after modification by means of heat treatment (60 min, 123 °C, pressure 17.2–21.7 psi) caused cell death in two cancer cell lines. The death of induced cells stood in marked contrast to classical apoptosis due to the absence of DNA cleavage. The results demonstrated the activity of autophagy. The unique case of autophagy has been observed in cells that were incubated with available pectin in a modified form. This autophagy activation seems to be shielding, for adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells, due to the high cytotoxicity of modified pectin, which is mediated by its inhibition with 3-methyladenine. The research verified the capacity of modified pectin to contribute to effective chemotherapy [
