<p class="p">One of the directions in antitumor research is the inhibition of galectin-3 (a lectin associated with cancer progression and metastasis). In general terms, pectins containing a more significant amount of neutral sugar possess higher bioactivity that is induced by the hypothesis in which galactan side-chains on pectin may bind to and suppress the pro-metastatic protein galectin-3, causing the inhibition of cancer cell aggregation, proliferation, metastasis, and adhesion. pH-modified citrus pectin was fractionated by using a combination of salting out, ion-exchange, and gel-permeation chromatography in order to identify the active components. Functionally, modified citrus pectin followed by elution with aqueous 0.25 M of NaCl contributed to suppressing galectin-3-mediated agglutination, and the RG-I-rich pectins with 1,4-linked Î²-
