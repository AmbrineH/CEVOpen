<p class="p">Silver nanoparticles were conjugated with pectin by Nwakwasi et al. to estimate the antitumor properties of nanocomposites against the canine fibroblast tumor (A-72) cell line. It was shown that the pectin-tagged silver nanocomposite exhibited a very significant cytotoxic effect on the A-72 cancer cell line when compared with the standard anti-cancer drug (Fluorouracil/5-FU) by attaining a maximum inhibition percentage of 85.88%, which is comparable to the 88.88% of fluorouracil/5-FU. This clearly indicates the antitumor efficacy of the synthesized nanocomposite when conjugated with pectin, and thus proved to be a potential anticancer drug [
