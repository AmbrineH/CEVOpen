<p class="p">Since selenium (Se) is of vital importance for human health, it can be a powerful tool either in cancer prevention or in cancer treatment, especially when it is combined with other antitumor substances. W. Chen et al. obtained a selenized derivative of pectic polysaccharide (sCPP1b) from Wen-Codonopsis pilosula, and assessed its antitumor activity in comparison with an original pectic polysaccharide (CPP1b). It was shown that CPP1b and sCPP1b had the capacity to inhibit cell migration, alter cell morphology, cause cell apoptosis, and prevent the cell cycle. CPP1b and sCPP1b promoted apoptosis on adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells by the upregulation of caspase-3 and Bax, and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 proteins. The study revealed the higher anticancer effect of sCPP1b in comparison with that of CPP1b [
