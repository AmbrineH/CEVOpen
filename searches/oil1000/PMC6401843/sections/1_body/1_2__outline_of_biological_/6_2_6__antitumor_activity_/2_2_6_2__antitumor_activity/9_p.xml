<p class="p">The study [
 <xref rid="B117-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>] presented a non-complicated green strategy for synthesizing ZnNPs with natural polysaccharides such as chitosan, citrus pectin, alginate, and the aqueous extract of fermented fenugreek by 
 <italic class="italic">Pleurotus ostreatus</italic>, using gamma irradiation as a new reducing and fixating agent. The synthesized ZnNPs explored dispersibility, with an average size of 46â€“53 nm, and induced anti-cancer properties, inhibiting Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma and human colon adenocarcinoma, as well as demonstrating a bactericidal effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria due to the smaller size.
