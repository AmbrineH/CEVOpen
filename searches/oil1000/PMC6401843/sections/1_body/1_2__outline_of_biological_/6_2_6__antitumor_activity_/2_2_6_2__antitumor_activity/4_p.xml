<p class="p">Gaikwad et al. designed pectin-poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) [PVP]-based curcumin particulates to increase the antitumor activity of curcumin. Pectin–PVP-based curcumin particulates (PECTIN–PVP CUR, CP1–CP4) were produced by spray-drying methods in various ratios. The angiolytic activity and MTT investigation of PECTIN-PVP CUR revealed significant antitumor effects in comparison with curcumin alone. Studies on the effect of curcumin and CP3 on lung cancer cells A549, demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxicity. It is proved that curcumin showed less cytotoxicity (% growth inhibition) compared to particulates (CP3) [
