 <italic class="italic">A. sphaerocephala</italic> polysaccharide was isolated and purified; the carbohydrate, protein, and uronic acid contents were 90.2%, 2.4%, and 16.3%, respectively. In vitro antitumor assays of selenized 
 <italic class="italic">A. sphaerocephala</italic> polysaccharides (SeASPs) showed higher anti-proliferative activity toward three tumor cell lines (lung adenocarcinoma cells, hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells, and cervical squamous carcinoma (Hela) cells) by a dose-related method. Selenylation was supposed to considerably improve the antitumor effects of polysaccharide derivatives in vitro. Sulfated 
 <italic class="italic">A. sphaerocephala</italic> polysaccharides (ASPs) were prepared, and the antitumor activity was evaluated in tumor cells and Hepatoma 22 tumor-bearing mice. Within in vitro experiments, ASPs significantly inhibited the growth of HepG2 and Hela cells. Moreover, no direct cytotoxicity against mouse fibroblast normal cells was observed in vitro. After oral administration for 12 days, the tumor growth was significantly suppressed by ASPs. The results of tumor histological morphology and cell cycle analysis showed that ASPs could arrest H22 cells at the S phase and promote cell apoptosis. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis displayed that ASPs influenced the downregulation of mutant p53 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner [
