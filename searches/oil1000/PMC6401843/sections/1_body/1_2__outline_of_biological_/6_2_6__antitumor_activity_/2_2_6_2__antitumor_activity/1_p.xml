<p class="p">Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic phytoconstituent extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> L., Zingiberaceae (turmeric), has been applied in the biomedical field [
 <xref rid="B105-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Curcumin produces a variety of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-cancer properties, as well as wound healing. However, due to its utterly low aqueous solubility, the bioavailability and stability of its application in medicine is limited [
 <xref rid="B106-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. The study investigated the inhibitory activity of pectin–curcumin (PEC-CCM) conjugates toward cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B107-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. The anti-cancer effect of PEC-CCM conjugates was estimated by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] test containing breast and hepatic cervical cancer cell lines, as well as a human normal kidney cell line. The comparison with free curcumin revealed that the curcumin of PEC-CCM conjugates obtained higher inhibitory activity against cancer cells and reduced cytotoxicity for normal cells. The improvement in the conjugates’ cytotoxicity to cancer cells was probably because of the increased water solubility and relative stability of PEC-CCM conjugates. Simultaneously, the good biocompatibility of pectin could contribute to the considerable reduction of the cytotoxicity of curcumin against normal cells, as this conjugate significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of curcumin to normal cells. Futhermore, conjugated curcumin displayed more distinct cytotoxicity and anti-oxidant effect than free curcumin. The research suggested the possible existence of a synergistic effect between curcumin in the conjugates and pectin.
