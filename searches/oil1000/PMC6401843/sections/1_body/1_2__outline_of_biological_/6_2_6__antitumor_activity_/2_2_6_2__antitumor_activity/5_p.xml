<p class="p">A self-assembled nanoparticles platform based on pectin–dihydroartemisinin conjugates for the co-delivery of anti-cancer drugs was developed by Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B113-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. A pectin-based nanocarrier was designed as a combined simultaneous multiple-cargo consisting of the hydrophobic drugs dihydroartemisinin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin to be delivered to tumor sites. The pectin–dihydroartemisinin/hydrooxycampothecin nanoparticles (PDC-H NPs) with a small particle size of ~70 nm were produced. In vitro tests displayed that the PDC-H NPs revealed a higher cellular uptake, greater cell apoptosis induction, and cell-viability inhibition capacity in contrast with dihydroartemisinin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin. PDC-H NPs could actively capture mammary carcinoma cells by confocal microscopy imaging [
