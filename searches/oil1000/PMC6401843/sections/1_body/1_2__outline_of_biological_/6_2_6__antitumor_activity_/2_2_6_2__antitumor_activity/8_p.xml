 <italic class="italic">Musa paradisiaca</italic>, was employed for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles. The anti-cancer potential of prepared nanoparticles was evaluated in mammary adenocarcinoma. There was an apoptosis induction mediated by gold nanoparticles (p-GNPs), and a decrease in the viability of treated cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) was observed. It was found that 50% of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells lose their viability at eight μg/mL and two μg/mL of p-GNPs at 48 h, respectively.
