 <xref rid="B81-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] was aimed at developing an edible pectin film saturated with essential oil, which can surge the antioxidant status and decrease the bacterial development in freshly cut peach. Cinnamon leaves were used as the natural source. Food-grade pectin dissolved in distilled water formed the film-producing solution, which was stirred for 15 min. After the addition of the plasticizer glycerol, the solution was restirred for 15 min. After preparation, the films were placed in storage in desiccators, at 4 Â°C of nitrogen atmosphere, protected from light, and analyzed 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> for a week. The total antioxidant activity was identified by means of the DPPH method that Molyneux presented. The edible pectin film with cinnamon leaf oil revealed an appreciable antioxidant capacity, which could be beneficial for both extending the shelf-life of food and for the human diet [
