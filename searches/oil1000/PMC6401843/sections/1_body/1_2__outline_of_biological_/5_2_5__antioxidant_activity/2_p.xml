 <xref rid="B62-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. The structure of the YM purified polysaccharide is RG-I. The YM polysaccharide demonstrated valued antioxidant effect as assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-radical scavenging activity, 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS+)-radical scavenging activity, and hydroxyl activity to scavenge. The research determined that the YM polysaccharide antioxidant activities could be verified by various in vitro methods. Besides, the purified YM polysaccharide revealed significant antimicrobial activity against definite fungal and bacterial strains. The YM polysaccharide due to its antifungal effect could alleviate sepsis. Therefore, the YM polysaccharide may be recommended for pharmaceutical purposes and food production [
