 <xref rid="B68-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. By means of single-factor tests, the impact of the pH, ratio of liquid to solid, extraction temperature, enzymolysis time, and the dosage of enzymes on the production of pomegranate peel (PPP) extracted by pectinase were studied [
 <xref rid="B69-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. The in vitro antioxidant effects of PPP were ascertained by establishing its decreasing and scavenging influence on hydroxyl radicals, DPPH radicals, and superoxide anion radicals. Based on an analysis of the experimental results, it was shown that PPP can be applied as a significant antioxidant and embrace novel functional food applications.
