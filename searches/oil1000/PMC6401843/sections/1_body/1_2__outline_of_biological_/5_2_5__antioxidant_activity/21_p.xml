<p class="p">Four polyphenol-conjugated pectins (catechin, quercetin, rutin, and hesperidin) have been synthesized as a result of epichlorohydrin conjugation reactions between polyphenol molecules and pectin in aqueous conditions. The conjugates demonstrate better solubility in water in comparison with neat pectin and polyphenols. The obtained new conjugates were discovered with satisfied stability to keep a common structureâ€“antioxidant property relationship, and metal ion-binding capacity was achieved. These pectin conjugates with cross-linking and antioxidant characteristics possess new applications that have been usefully employed in the pharmaceutical, food, biomedicine, and cosmetics fields [
