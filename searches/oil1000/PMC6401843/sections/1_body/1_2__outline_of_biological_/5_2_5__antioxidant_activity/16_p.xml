<p class="p">The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of honokiol (HNK) and modified citrus pectin (MCP) have been investigated in vitro in the report [
 <xref rid="B87-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. The dependence of the antioxidant activity of HNK and MCP on their doses was shown, wherein MCP revealed a significantly higher antioxidant capacity. The MCP:HNK (9:1) combination showed a synergistic effect on antioxidant activity. Further study into this composition is reasonable, owing to the significant combination effect to inhibit cyclooxygenase-II activity, nuclear factor-kappa B activity, and tumor necrosis-Î± synthesis in mouse monocytes [
