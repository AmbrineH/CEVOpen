<p class="p">Alperujo, a by-product extracted from the manufacture of olive oil, was treated by a new method of gentle heating at 50–80 °C over one to two hours, and was then carried out in a three-phase centrifugation system that produced alperujo oil, olive oil cake, and aqueous by-products. Firstly, the pectic substances were obtained hydrothermally by the treatment of alperujo at 160 °C for 30 min, 45 min, or 60 min [

The pectins that were isolated in these conditions possessed a significant degree of esterification and a low molecular weight. The properties of the pectic substances obtained from olive mill wastewater were studied in comparison with commercial pectins from apple and citrus [

The purification procedure decreased the proportion of GalA compared to the neutral sugar amount in the pectic material, which predominantly consisted of arabinose (Ara) (32% and 34%), GalA (24% and 18%), galactose (Gal) (17% and 16%), glucose (Glc) (9% and 16%) and rhamnose (Rha) (7% and 11%). The polysaccharides extracted from alperujo demonstrate metabolic activity and may be applied to regulate cholesterol metabolism and control diabetes in vitro. The antioxidant activity, bile–acid binding, and glucose-retardation capability of the polysaccharides were estimated in vitro. The raw and purified polysaccharides, including two functions of dietary fiber and antioxidants, can produce beneficial effects in the colon, contributing to the prevention of chronic diseases, including bowel cancer.
