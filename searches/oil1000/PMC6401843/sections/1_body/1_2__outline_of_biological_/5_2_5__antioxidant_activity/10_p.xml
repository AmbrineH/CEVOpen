 <italic class="italic">Helianthus tuberosus</italic>) residues with 5% moisture in weight. The impact of pH, extraction temperature, and liquid-to-solid ratio on pectin output were examined. In addition, the associations between pectin properties such as antioxidant effects, surface structures, and drying conditions were investigated. The DPPH radical-scavenging activities of Jerusalem artichoke pectin dried by the three different methods were indicated with the slightly modified technique. The results of the work reveal the noncritical role of drying methods in terms of the structure of Jerusalem artichoke. Assessments on the antioxidant effects of pectins treated by various methods indicated that spray-dried pectin and apple pectin possess higher activity than pectin after vacuum oven and vacuum freeze desiccation. The reduction activities of pectin are connected with the presence of hydroxyl groups and electron transfer from pectin (ROH or ROâ€“) to DPPH. It was investigated that the pectin of Jerusalem artichoke can be an available antioxidant source of plant origin that could be used in the preparation of food [
