<p class="p">Ogutu and Mua investigated the influence of ultrasound effect, including its power, duty cycle, and time, on sweet potato pectin’s structure, molecular weight, antioxidant activity, and neutral sugar composition. Sonication increased the antioxidant activity of 200-W and 400-W sonicated pectin, obtaining more significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) values, with considerable pectin content providing inherently high antioxidant activity than native and 100-W treated pectin. The ORAC value of 400-W sonicated pectin quintupled what native pectin possessed, when the FRAP amount was three times as high as native pectin. This is due to the fact that the ultrasonic treatment reduces the molecular weight of pectin, while polydispersity did not reveal an obvious trend as determined by incidental pectin scission, soaring the duty cycle from 20% to 80%, and contributing to a threefold decrease in the pectin’s molecular weight. A sharp rise of galacturonic acid content from 72.0% ± 1.2% in native pectin to between 85.0% ± 3.2% and 92.0% ± 2.7% was influenced by the surged sonication power. Meanwhile, the degree of methoxylation declined from 12.0% ± 3.0% to between 5.25%–6.28%. Nevertheless, ultrasound did not change the primary structure of the pectin, as verified by FTIR and High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography results. It was demonstrated that ultrasound provides an eco-friendly and effective method for pectin transformation, and powerful pectin products regarding antioxidant content can be developed [
