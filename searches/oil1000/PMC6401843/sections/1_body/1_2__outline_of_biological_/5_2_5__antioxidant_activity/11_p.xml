<p class="p">Alcoholic and aqueous extracts from various of fruits were produced; then, the antioxidant activity of every sample were characterized, and the main bioactive components in them were estimated. The film characteristics after the addition of fruit extracts with stronger antioxidant effects than pectin-based films were studied. Pectin films comprising fruit extracts were assessed in relation to their phytochemical contents, ultraviolet light transmission, and antioxidant activity for 90 days of shelf life storage. The chemical, mechanical, and physical properties, as well as the antioxidant stability of the films were characterized. The results of the research of phenol compounds, including the content of anthocyanin, vitamin C, carotenoids, and antioxidant activity of the extracts from pequi, acerola, cashew apple, papaya, and strawberry were obtained. The insertion of extracts into the pectin films contributed to the higher antioxidant activity of these materials, and the pectin film with acerola extract possessed the best antioxidant capacity; thus, it is another potential material in coatings for different food applications as well as for antioxidant films [
