 <xref rid="B88-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] compared the polysaccharide composition and phenolic compound contents of transgenic plants and control plants, as well as the mechanical properties of flax fibers, in order to establish the usefulness of this transgenic plant for textile and pharmaceutical production. The contents of such polysaccharides as hemicellulose, cellulose, and pectin in transgenic flax were in abundance, and a decreased amount of lignin was detected. The inhibition of â€¢DPPH radicals in the cell wall fraction was estimated. The transgenic plants revealed a higher degree of antioxidant activity in comparison with the control plants, which proved their possible application in biomedicine [
