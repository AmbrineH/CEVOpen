<p class="p">An ester form of retinol and palmitic acid, presented as retinyl palmitate (RP), possesses active anti-aging properties that have been utilized to cure and prevent wrinkles; it is an essential ingredient of anti-aging cosmetics. The antioxidant activity of pectin and other polysaccharides for the development of cosmetics products with antioxidant activity similar to RP has been studied. The effects of the composition parameters of pectin on the degradation profiles of RP were researched. Furthermore, the effect of pectin on the stability of RP was considered as a time function. In the group of the polysaccharides that were tested, pectin displayed a significant antioxidative effect, which was analyzed by DPPH radical-scavenging method. The antioxidative activity of pectin seems to be caused by the presence of the hydroxyl group. The lower concentration of RP (0.01%,
