<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of methyl cellulose (MC) was compared with those for high methoxyl pectin (HMP) in edible films, putting an emphasis on stability of ascorbic acid (AA). The findings verified that the stability of AA hydrolytic surged and the non-enzymatic browning decreased due to the hydrophobicity of MC. HMP and MC could form physical blends. The 50:50 HMP:MC films revealed high antioxidant activity, protecting walnut oil. The polymeric film microstructure influenced the stability of the AA and antioxidant properties [
