<p class="p">Oxidation is vital to plenty of organisms that can generate energy to supply biological processes. In normal circumstances, free radicals govern cell growth, and suppress viruses and bacteria. Nevertheless, in large quantities and without regulation, the production of free radicals induced by oxygen cause cell damage, which renders the pathological progressions. The oxidative stress is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and myocardial infarction. The synthetic antioxidants that are usually applied in manufacturing processes are considered to be cytotoxic. Natural polysaccharides are regarded as reliable antioxidants, possessing the ability to scavenge free radicals and surpass synthetic substances on the subject of health concerns [
