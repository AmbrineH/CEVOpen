<p class="p">The influence of the structural characteristics of citrus pectin—particularly the degree of methylation (DM) and the degree of blocking (DBabs)—on the oxidative and physicochemical stability of linseed/sunflower oil emulsions (LSSO), which were earlier treated with a synthetic emulsion stabilizer, were investigated. The DM of pectin did not contribute to the physicochemical stability of the LSSO emulsions, but obviously affected their oxidative stability. Low DM pectin (≤33%) revealed more significant lipid antioxidant capacity in comparison with high or intermediate DM pectin (≥58%). The pectin lipid antioxidant effect may be caused by its ability to chelate pro-oxidant Fe

Furthermore, pectin additives in edible emulsions can contribute to produce clean food products with antioxidant properties, since pectin can demonstrate different functionalities [
