 <xref rid="B86-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] beneficiated the chicken meat product with the freeze-dried fiber microparticles (MPCs) of Japanese plum extracted separately from the peel and pulp. The meat product constitutes a worthwhile matrix to assess the application of plum peel and pulp MPCs as antioxidant food additives. The obtained proteinâ€“carbohydrate products possess functional properties.
