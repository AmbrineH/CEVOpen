 <xref rid="B76-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], an effective microwave-assisted extraction technique was applied to produce pectic polysaccharide (TPPs) from tangerine peel with the yield of 20%. As a result of purification by chromatography pectic polysaccharide, TPPs-2-1 was obtained. TPPs-2-1 comprised generally GalA, Rha, Ara, Gal, Man, Glc. TPPs-2-1 possessed α-glycosidic bonds, and had a typical IR spectra that was characteristic of pectic polysaccharides. Moreover, TPPs-2-1 had a significant FRAP value, as well as high radical scavenging effects against •OH and •DPPH; however, it also had low scavenging indices against •O
 <sup class="sup">2−</sup>. The properties of TPPs-2-1 was influenced by its molecular weight, as well as the composition of monosaccharides and methods of extraction. The results verified the capacity of TPPs-2-1 to be antioxidant, as well as its capacity for application in pharmacology and as an ingredient for functional food [
