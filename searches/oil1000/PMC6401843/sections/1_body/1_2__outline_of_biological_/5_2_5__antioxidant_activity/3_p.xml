 <italic class="italic">L. chuanxiong</italic> (LCP-II-I). Structural analysis showed that its long HG-1 segments alternated with RG-I segments, and side chains of arabinogalactan type I and arabinan. This LCP-II-I demonstrated effective protection against the oxidative action of the intestinal stress. It was shown that LCP-II-I treatment is a powerful way to safeguard SW480 cells against the oxidative stress triggered by H
