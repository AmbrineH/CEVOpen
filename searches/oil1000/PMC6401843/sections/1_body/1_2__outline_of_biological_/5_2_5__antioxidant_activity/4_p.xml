 <xref rid="B67-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], a pectic polysaccharide extracted by hot water with further chromatography, and then dialyzed and lyophilized, allowed obtaining pure polysaccharide (CHIP3). Chaoyang Wei et al. evaluated the in vitro antioxidant activity of the substance and investigated the structure of the purified CHIP3 by means of FTIR. Five monosaccharides such as rhamnose, galacturonic acid, arabinose, mannose, and galactose are part of pectic polysaccharide CHIP3. Its primary structure consists of recurrent segments of an RG-I. In addition, CHIP3 demonstrated a high ferric decreasing-effects power with an 824.3 µM ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) value at 1.0 mg/mL, which is a powerful scavenging degree for (ABTS+)-radical with EC 50 (246.85 µg/mL). Also, CHIP3 has a considerable restricting influence on HepG2 cells (IC 50 = 242.6 µg/mL) in the cytotoxicity testing in vitro. The research revealed CHIP3 to be a functional ingredient of nourishment that could possibly possess antioxidant properties [
