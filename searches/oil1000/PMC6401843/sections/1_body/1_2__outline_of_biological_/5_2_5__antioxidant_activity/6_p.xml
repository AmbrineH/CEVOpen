 <italic class="italic">Artocarpus heterophyllus</italic>) with its large fruits is widely spread in the tropical and subtropical areas. The pulp is usually consumed fresh and processed by the inhabitants of China. Since almost 60% of the fruit is inedible, the large amount of non-utilized product caused a challenge, and inspired the investigation of techniques to utilize the waste. Pectin from jackfruit peel was obtained by means of various mineral acids and organic acids. In the research, microwave processes were performed alternating with an ultrasound method for the extraction of pectin from jackfruit peel. The monosaccharide composition of pectin was indicated to include galacturonic acid, glucose, arabinose, galactose, and rhamnose. The results confirm the promising ability of pectins from jackfruit peel to serve as natural antioxidants in food production [
