<p class="p">Currently, pectins have become an important part of the research and development of natural medicines and health products due to their wide availability. Pectins isolated from various plants as well as modified pectins are intensively observed. On one hand, this review covers the bioactivity of pectin polysaccharides, including their various pharmacological applications, i.e., their immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antibacterial, antioxidant, and antitumor activities have been summarized, and their use as a carrier for drug delivery has been assessed. On the other hand, the research is focused on the relationship between the chemical structure and biological activity of pectins with the aim of expanding their use in medicine and pharmacology. </p>
