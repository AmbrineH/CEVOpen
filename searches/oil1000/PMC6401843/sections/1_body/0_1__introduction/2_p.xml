<p class="p">According to specifications approved by the Food and Agriculture Organization, industrial pectins include at least 65% polygalacturonic acid, which is concomitant with different other conditions to satisfy the specification of E440 performing the function of the food additive. The most traditional raw materials that are used for the extraction of pectins are either apple pomace or citrus peels, which are by-products of juice manufacturing units. Both materials contain significant amounts of pectic substances, but with different chemical characteristics that make them suitable for specific applications [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Commercially, pectin is usually obtained from the residue of plant material after extracting the juice (apple or citrus peel) or sugar (sugar beet). The main trial applications of citrus or apple pectin are as gel-forming agents, thickeners, or stabilizers for acidic beverages. Extracts of sugar beet pectin are poor gel-forming agents, but show potential roles as emulsifiers [

Pectin is also capable of being used for drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract in the covered form as gel beads, film, and matrix tablets.
