<p class="p">Pectins are biopolymers with multiple applications because of their structural diversity and complexity. Although pectins from different sources have some common structural characteristics, many aspects of the common structure change according to the species and the physiological stage of the plant. In addition, the application of pectin is determined by its chemical features, including galacturonic acid content, methoxyl content, and degree of acetylation [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-10-01407" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Pectin is a polysaccharide with a core consisting of α-1,4-linked 
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-galacturonic acid and α-1,2-
 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-rhamnose units in turn, as well as a large number of neutral sugars, including arabinose, galactose, and lesser amounts of other sugars. Pectins have a linear anionic backbone with regions having no side chains known as “smooth regions”, and regions with non-ionic side chains known as “hairy regions” [
