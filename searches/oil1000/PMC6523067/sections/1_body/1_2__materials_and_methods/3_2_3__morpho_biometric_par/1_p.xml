<p class="p">Body weight was measured using an electronic scale (Ohaus Adventurer SL Precision Balance, Mod: AS8100) and total body length was determined using a metric scale. At the end of the feeding experiment, the following indices were also determined (50 fish/tank/feed): condition index (KI) = ((100 × fish weight)/fish length
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>), viscerosomatic index (VSI) = (viscera weight/whole body weight) × 100, perivisceral fat index (PFI) = (perivisceral fat/body weight) × 100, and hepatosomatic index (HSI) = (liver weight/body weight) × 100. In order to measure the PFI and the VSI, the fat adherent to the digestive tract was accurately separated and individually weighed.
