<p class="p">For the trial, 460 sea bream fingerlings that weighed 75 ± 1.1 g were randomly distributed at a density of 8 kg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> in nine 2 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> indoor tanks, which were supplied by three separate recirculating aquaculture systems at 21.0 ± 0.5 °C. To avoid possible differences associated with different recirculating water systems, each feed was administered in one of the three tanks of each water circuit. Each feed was assigned to three tanks and distributed twice a day ad libitum over 6 days per week. Any excess feed was removed after 15 min using a siphon hose system. The feeding trial lasted 90 days and the fish were weighed individually at the beginning of the trial and subsequently on a monthly basis. The palatability of the feeds was assayed according to the formula: (ingested feed/administered feed) × 100.
