<p class="p">The chemical analyses of the three samples of each feed were performed according to the procedure outlined by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The total lipid content was determined using the procedure described by Folch et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The essential amino acids in the three feeds were determined by acid hydrolysis (6 N HCl for 24 h at 110 °C), which was followed by ion exchange chromatography utilizing an amino acid analyzer (L-8800 Auto-analyzer, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan). After determining the total lipid content, the fatty acids were converted to methyl esters following the method described by Christopherson and Glass [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The separation of fatty acids was carried out using a GC 3800 gas chromatograph (Varian Strumentazione, Cernusco sul Naviglio, Italy) with a WP-4 Shimadzu integration system (Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), which was equipped with a Supelco SPTM-2340 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter; 0.25 μm film thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and a flame ionization detector.
