<p class="p">Three feeds, which were namely one control (L1) and two experimental diets (L2, L3), were formulated to have a similar energy content and were isonitrogenous (around 45%) and isolipidic (around 13%). In the L1 feed, the chironomid meal was absent and the protein source was mainly represented by soybean meal, as reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-09-00144-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. In L2, the proportion of soybean meal as a protein source was increased (33.5%), whereas the source of fish meal was reduced (15%) due to the inclusion of chironomid meal (5%). In the L3 feed, the fish meal was further reduced (8%) and the chironomid meal was increased to 10% of the protein source (
