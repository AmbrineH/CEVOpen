<p class="p">During the spring and summer of 2017, around 100 kg of chironomid larvae was collected using nylon net traps from ponds and aquatic environments, which were located between the Emilia Romagna and Marche regions. The larvae were washed and kept at a temperature of 4 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the larvae were pooled and dried at a temperature of 70 °C before being milled. The meal samples were analyzed for their proximate composition (moisture, protein, lipid, and ash content) as well as their amino acid and fatty acid profiles, whereas the other lots were stored, waiting to be included in the diets. The same analyses were performed on the fish meal that was going to be included in the experimental feeds (
