 <xref rid="animals-09-00144-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The chemical composition of the chironomid meal showed a lower protein and ash content and a higher lipid content with respect to the fish meal. The amino acid composition of the chironomid meal had a higher content of Valine (VAL), Threonine (THR), and Phenylalanine (PHE) with respect to the fish meal whereas Arginine (ARG), Histidine (HIS), Isoleucine (ISO), Leucine (LEU), Lysine (LYS), and Methionine (MET) were higher in the fish meal. With respect to the fatty acid profile, the saturated fatty acids (SFA) fraction in the chironomid meal was lower (34.75%) than in the fish meal (43.79%); the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) fraction was higher in the chironomid meal (37.83%) than in the fish meal (30.2%). The PUFAs ɷ6 (21.86%) were higher in the chironomid meal compared to the fish meal (4.1%) whereas the PUFAs ɷ3 were higher in the fish meal (21.91%) with respect to the chironomid meal (5.56%).
