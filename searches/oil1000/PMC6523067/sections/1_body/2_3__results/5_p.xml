 <xref rid="animals-09-00144-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The L2 and L3 groups showed similar growth performances with respect to the L1 group as there were no differences in the final mean body weights and specific growth rates. The final mean body weights exhibited good results with an increase of 127â€“132% after 90 days of trial. The feed conversion rate was favorable in all the groups and ranged from 1.18 (L1) to 1.22 (L3). The survival rate was high in all three groups with no notable differences as it ranged from 94.31 (L1) to 93.62 (L3). Feed palatability showed similar results in all three diets. With regard to the morpho-biometric parameters and somatic indices, no significant differences were observed among the groups in KI, PFI, VSI, and HSI.
