<p class="p">In the last few years, chironomids have often been overabundant in certain seasons of the year and caused trouble in different areas. In recent times, flights in the airports close to the North Adriatic coast have been blocked due to the blooms of chironomid flies. In the Trasimeno Lake, the densities of chironomids are very high in the summer season and much effort is spent in controlling or reducing them [

Recently, a study was performed on chironomid larvae in basins and channels in which a high quantity of larvae was captured and dehydrated. The chemical composition analyses showed good nutritional profiles in the chironomid larvae meals, making them suitable for fish feeding [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Continuing the studies on the possible inclusion of chironomid in feeds for aquaculture species, a growth trial was performed to assess the effects of the meal obtained from chironomid species collected from an aquatic environment on gilthead sea bream (
 <italic class="italic">Sparus aurata</italic> L.). In order to achieve this, samples of midges at the larval stage were converted into meal and first analyzed from a qualitative point of view. After this, the chironomid meal was included in the feedstuffs for gilthead sea bream juveniles.
