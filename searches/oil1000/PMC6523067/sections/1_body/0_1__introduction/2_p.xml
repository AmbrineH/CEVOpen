<p class="p">Insects with aquatic larval stages have been less frequently studied than mealworms and flies. Some studies have investigated aquatic invertebrates as they could represent an important source of nutrients for both humans and livestock. Among lake flies, chironomids are common in aquatic environments and are found at different latitudes [

 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Furthermore, they are the prey of different fish species. There are different chironomid species, including freshwater, euryhaline, and marine species. Although they have seasonal availability, these insects can reach a very high density in their natural habitat, creating swarms of flying insects in summer [

 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Eggs deposited on the water surface after each swarming event soon develop into larvae. In these situations, the chironomid larvae can be captured in high quantities and employed after dehydration for ornamental fish feeding [
