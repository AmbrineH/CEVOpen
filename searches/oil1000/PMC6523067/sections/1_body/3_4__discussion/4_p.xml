<p class="p">Regarding the fatty acid profile, according to Raksakantong et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], insects characterized by an aquatic life cycle, such as chironomids, are different from terricolous insects because they contain long-chain PUFAs due to their diet and enzymatic activity, which may increase the synthesis of long-chain PUFAs. In the literature [

 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], chironomid insects have been reported to have a significant content of EPA (ranging between 3.4% and 11.6% of total fatty acids), which is higher than that recorded in our study, although the results of DHA are consistent with that found in the literature (0.5% compared to 0.1 and 0.2%). In juvenile lake trout [
