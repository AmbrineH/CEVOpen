<p class="p">The chironomid meal had a similar composition to the chironomids grown in controlled conditions on pure cultures of microalgae (Habib et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]). However, the preparation used in the present study had higher protein and lower lipid contents relative to the chironomids grown in an algal culture by Habib et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In our case, the origin of chironomids from earth-bottom substrates, naturally colonized by microalgae and zooplankton, improved the amino acid profile of chironomids. The levels of tryptophan, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine were similar to fish meal and placed this species of insects among those with an adequate composition among the order Diptera, as reported in a review regarding the body composition of several insects compared with the main sources for animal feeding [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The levels of these amino acids are different from almost all other insect meals, which are considered to be low in lysine, histidine, and tryptophan for fish [
