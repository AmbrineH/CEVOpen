<p class="p">The chironomids used in the current study were harvested from wild freshwater environments. The FAO recommends that the insects should be obtained through production activities in order to guarantee the security of the product and to avoid threatening existing populations [

However, as mentioned previously, chironomids are often overabundant in certain seasons of the year and can be a nuisance in many areas. Thus, chironomids could be harvested when the maximum concentration of larvae is found in the aquatic environment. It is also possible to trigger their production and induce a midge-larvae abundance of chironomids using available techniques, such as the reported channel catfish fingerlings reared in plastic-lined and earthen basins [

Although the chironomid meal was used in small quantities, our results suggest that there is a significant advantage in replacing 50% of the fish meal with chironomid meal during the growth of gilthead sea bream.
