<p class="p">In this trial, a diet formulation similar to that adopted by the aquafeed companies was employed, in which there is a lower amount of fish meal that is compensated by protein sources of vegetable and terrestrial origin. Soybean was used as the main protein source (32â€“33%), followed by gluten and wheat meals, which are considered more sustainable than fish meal. Hemoglobin was also included to guarantee the presence of high digestible proteins due to its high lysine and leucine contents [

The inclusion of chironomid meal in the feeds represented 5% and 10% of the protein source of the two experimental feeds, respectively. In this way, the replacement of the fish meal reached 25% and 50%, respectively, in the two diets that included chironomid meal. In both groups, when the level of chironomid insect inclusion reached 10% (L3) or was limited at 5% (L2) for replacing fish meal, the gilthead sea bream showed satisfactory growth performances that were similar to the control group (L1).
