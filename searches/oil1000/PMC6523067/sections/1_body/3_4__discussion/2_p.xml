<p class="p">Many studies have focused on the search for the most suitable insect species to replace the more expensive and unsustainable fish meal in aquaculture diets and the results are generally encouraging. In juvenile Jian carp (
 <italic class="italic">Cyprinus carpio</italic>) that were fed diets with different levels of substitution of soybean oil with black soldier flies, no differences in growth performances were reported [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In European sea bass (
 <italic class="italic">Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>) juveniles, the inclusion of 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> to replace 50% of the fish meal resulted in a whole-body crude protein and ether extract that was not significantly influenced by the use of insect meal [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Other authors [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-09-00144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] recently observed improved growth performances with respect to a control diet when gilthead sea bream juveniles were fed a formulation that included 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic>. These authors employed sea breams that weighted 105.1 g, which reached market size after 163 days. They attributed these positive results to the inclusion of a moderate percentage of insect meal and the effect of chitin on protein digestibility since it confers a higher protein binding capacity. In our study, the market size was not reached because smaller juveniles (75 g) were employed and the trial lasted only 3 months. However, the fishes exhibited good growth performances. With regard to the somatic indices, the similarity of the results indicated that no adverse effect was observed and the assimilation of the L2 and L3 diets was efficient.
