<p id="Par43" class="p">Oils from 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> showed significant antibacterial properties which can be justified by the presence of different classes of fatty acids including PUFA including, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, palmitoleic acid and oleic acid.
