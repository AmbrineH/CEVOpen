<p id="Par34" class="p">Oil from 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> extracted by cooking-pressing method exhibited the lowest rate of monounsaturated fatty acids, this reflects its low rate of oleic acid (C18:1). Oil from 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> obtained by cooking-pressing method revealed high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to maceration. Instead, low rate of polyunsaturated fatty acid in 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil obtained by maceration was observed and could be due to the absence of lignoceric, cetoleic arachidonic acid and low rates of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. These fatty acids could have been oxidized and converted into hydroperoxides and malondialdehydes. This is in line with the previous result showing that the oil from 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> obtained by maceration was more affected during the extraction process.
