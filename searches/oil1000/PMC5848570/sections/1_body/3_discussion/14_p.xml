<p id="Par41" class="p">Oil from 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> obtained by cooking-pressing method showed activity on seven of the eight tested bacteria compared to those from 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> obtained by cooking -pressing and maceration methods which revealed activity on six and four tested bacteria respectively. On the other hand, the best activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil obtained by cooking-pressing method compared to that obtained by maceration was noticed. Differences in antibacterial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oils could be attributed to oxidation of PUFA responsible for the activity through the maceration method. Moreover, the proportion of the PUFA responsible for the activity in the mixture may also be associated with the activity, explaining the differences between 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> oils obtained with same procedure.
