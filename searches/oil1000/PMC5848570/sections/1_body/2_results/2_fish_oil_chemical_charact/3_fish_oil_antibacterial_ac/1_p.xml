<p id="Par27" class="p">Oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> showed antibacterial activities on tested bacteria (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oils obtained by both cooking-pressing and maceration methods showed MICs values ranging between 32 and 64 mg/ml while 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> oil obtained by cooking- pressing method showed MICs values between 8 and 64 mg/ml. 
 <italic class="italic">C. nigrodigitatus</italic> oil extracted by cooking-pressing method was active on six of the eight tested bacteria, whereas that obtained by maceration was active on four of the eight tested bacteria. 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> oil extracted by cooking-pressing method was active on seven of the eight tested bacteria. The most important activity was obtained with this oil on two of the three strains of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with MIC value of 8 mg/ml. Considering the whole antibacterial activity, it appears that 
 <italic class="italic">H. odoe</italic> oil obtained by cooking-pressing method was the most active on the tested bacteria.
