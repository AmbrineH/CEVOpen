<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed using a microdilution assay in 96 well plates according to the experiment of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards[
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] with modification; the different concentrations of cinnamon EO and antibiotics were prepared in a suspension containing 0.2% agar in sterile distilled water.[
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] They were carried out by successive dilutions 1/2 ranging from 5000 to 9 μg/ml for EO and from 200 to 0.4 μg/ml for antibiotics. Cinnamon EO or antibiotics were added at different concentrations at the corresponding well in plate. The concentrations obtained in the wells are between 1250 and 2 μg/ml for EO and between 50 and 0.1 μg/ml for antibiotics. Bacterial suspensions were prepared in the same manner described previously and diluted in MH broth and plated in 96 well plates at a density of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/ml. Finally, the plates were incubated at 37°C for 18–24 h. Bacterial growth was visually by adding to each well 20 μl of 2.3.5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride aqueous solution (1%). MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that does not produce red color.[
