 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> (cinnamon) barks were purchased from a local supermarket in Fez province (Morocco). A total of 200 g of cinnamon barks was subjected to hydrodistillation for 3 H with 700 ml of distilled water using a Clevenger-type modified apparatus. The hydrosol was collected in a separatory funnel (1 L) so that the heavy oil was decanted to the bottom of the flask, while the hydrosol water was recycled into the flask containing the boiling plant material. The EO was collected and stored at 4Â°C before analysis.
