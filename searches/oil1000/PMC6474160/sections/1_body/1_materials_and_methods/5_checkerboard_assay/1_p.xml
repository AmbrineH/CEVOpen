<p class="p">The evaluation of the interaction between cinnamon EO and antibiotics was carried out according to the method of Mody[
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, ten concentrations of cinnamon EO and eight concentrations of each antibiotic were prepared in sterile tubes by dilutions 1/2. Subsequently, EO at decreasing concentrations, going from MIC × 4 to MIC/128, was introduced horizontally into the 96 well plates. In the same manner, the antibiotics at decreasing concentrations, going from MIC × 4 to MIC/32, was introduced vertically. The final volume in each well was 200 μl comprising 25 μl of EO, 25 μl of one of the antibiotics' dilution, and 150 μl of MH media containing 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/ml of bacterial suspensions. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 18 h. The analysis of the combination was obtained by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) using the following formula:[
