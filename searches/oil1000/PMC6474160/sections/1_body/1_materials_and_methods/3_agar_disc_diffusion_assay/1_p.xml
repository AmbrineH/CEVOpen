Sterile 6 mm diameter filter discs (Whatman paper No 3) were impregnated with 10 μg/disc of the compounds and were put onto the surface of the inoculated MH agar. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 h. The antibacterial effect was evaluated by measuring the inhibition zones against the tested bacterial strains. All the tests were performed in triplicate. The values of inhibition diameter are given as mean ± standard deviation. The results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Differences at
