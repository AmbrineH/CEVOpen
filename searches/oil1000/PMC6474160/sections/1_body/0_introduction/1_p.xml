<p class="p">Multidrug-resistant bacteria are widely known as a serious threat to global health in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] The World Health Organization published in 2017 a report listing the most dangerous multidrug-resistant bacteria to which new antibiotics should be urgently discovered.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] The discovery of new antibacterial agents was mainly based on natural products that can be obtained from different sources including plants, bacteria, algae, fungi, and animals; but, there has been an increased interest in bioactive compounds provided by the plant as an alternative to the common antibiotics.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] Essential oils (EOs) account for a source of very promising natural compounds for producing new antibacterial drugs. Numerous studies have reported a strong antibacterial effect for some EOs.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] Among these EOs, the potential antibacterial of cinnamon has been documented frequently.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] Furthermore, the combinations, either single EOs or mixtures of purified main components, would assure the exhibition of the target bacteria to many chemical compounds and usually lead to better activity.[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] Combining different EOs has been recently studied in a view to increasing their antibacterial effect without increasing their concentration.[
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] It was argued that the combination of cinnamon and some plants' EOs showed an additive effect against bacterial species compared to their pure EOs.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] Limited reports on the combinations of cinnamon with antibiotics demonstrated synergistic and additive effects against various microorganisms.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no available data about the antibacterial activity of cinnamon EO associated with antibiotics against multidrug-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853. Therefore, the aim of this study was to search the possible synergistic antibacterial effect of cinnamon EO combined with certain classical antibiotics as ampicillin, streptomycin, or chloramphenicol against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>.
