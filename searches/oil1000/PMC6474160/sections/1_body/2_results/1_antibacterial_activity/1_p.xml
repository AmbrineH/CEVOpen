<p class="p">The antibacterial activity of the cinnamon EO, streptomycin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol tested against three bacterial strains (
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853) and the MIC results are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Cinnamon oil was able to inhibit all strains tested: 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>., 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> with the MIC of 4.88, 4.88, and 19.53 μg/ml, respectively. However, streptomycin had the same MIC (3.13 μg/ml) against all bacteria strains. Ampicillin and chloramphenicol inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with the same MIC of 0.31 μg/ml. However, the antibacterial effect of ampicillin was higher than that of chloramphenicol against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with the MIC of 0.16 and 0.31 μg/ml, respectively. While 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> was resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol [
