<p class="p">Tables 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> show the cinnamon oil tested against three multidrug-resistant bacteria in combination with some antibiotics. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, mixing antibiotics with cinnamon EO reduces the MICs, 2 fold for 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, 2–8 fold for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 2–4 for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. As revealed in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the synergistic effect was obtained by the combination of cinnamon EO with ampicillin or chloramphenicol against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and by the combination of EO and chloramphenicol against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with the FICI of 0.5. However, an additive effect was founded when EO was combined with streptomycin against all stains tested; 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>; with FICI of 1.00, 0.75, and 1.00, respectively. Moreover, the combination EO–ampicillin showed an indifferent effect against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> with the FICI of 1.25 [
