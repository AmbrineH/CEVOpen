<p class="p">Based on the results in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, it was known that the cinnamon oil was able to inhibit all strains tested; these results are relatively in agreement with the previous reports.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] The high antibacterial activity observed in cinnamon EO may be due to the action of transcinnamaldehyde, considered as its single major compound.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] It has been reported that transcinnamaldehyde possesses the highest antimicrobial in comparison with other constituents of cinnamon oil.[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] On the other hand, synergistic interactions between different plant extracts are the aim of the herbal formulation in folk medicine.[
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] Some authors had determined the antibacterial effect of cinnamon EO combinations; Utchariyakiat et al. showed that cinnamon EO combined with colistin demonstrated a synergistic action against multidrug-resistant 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] Mahadlek et al. used the checkerboard assay to determine the activity of cinnamon oil associated with the same antimicrobial agents; they observed that cinnamon EO combinations with doxycycline hyclate, ciprofloxacin HCl, or metronidazole displayed an additive against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538P.[
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] It was reported that the association of cinnamon oil and piperacillin demonstrated a synergistic interaction against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] There are some reports on the interaction between plant EOs and antibiotics, which indicated a synergistic action.[
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] These data were confirmed by the present work, thus highlighting the efficacy of cinnamon oil when combined with ampicillin or chloramphenicol. The effect of a combination of cinnamon and other EOs was reported, for example, Clemente et al. demonstrated that the combination of cinnamon with mustard EOs showed an additive effect against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> ATCC25922, 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, and some other bacteria species.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] Lu et al. showed that cinnamon combined with thyme or clove EOs displayed in most cases an additive or indifferent action against foodborne bacteria.[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] However, the mechanism that is responsible for the antimicrobial activity of cinnamon includes its chemical composition such as Cinnamaldehyde,[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] which is an electronegative molecule that could interfere with the cellular biological process, particularly nitrogen-containing substances such as proteins and nucleic acids.[
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] Furthermore, cinnamon EO has been reported to inhibit bacteria through antiquorum sensing effects; inhibiting cell division, ATPase, biofilm formation membrane porin, and mobility; altering the lipid profile[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and thereby acting cell membrane producing lumps and autoaggregation.[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] These properties could conduct the reduction of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, decrease the dose of the antibiotic required for treatment, and therefore will decrease the toxic side effects of the drugs.[
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] However, other studies are needed to explain the mechanism responsible for the antibacterial effect of the combination of cinnamon and antibiotics.
