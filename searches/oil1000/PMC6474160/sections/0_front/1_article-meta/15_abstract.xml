 <p class="p">The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> (cinnamon) essential oil (EO) alone and in combination with some classical antibiotics against three multidrug-resistant bacteria, 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, to search a possible synergy. The antibacterial activity of all tested compounds was determined by agar disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays. The checkerboard method was used to quantify the efficacy of cinnamon EO in combination with these antibiotics. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated and interpreted as synergy, addition, indifferent, or antagonism. A synergistic interaction was shown against 
  <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> with the combination cinnamon EO and ampicillin or chloramphenicol and against 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> when cinnamon EO was combined with chloramphenicol. However, the combination of cinnamon oil and streptomycin displayed additive effects against all bacteria stains. The combinations of cinnamon EO and antibiotics can be used as an alternative therapeutic application, which can decrease the minimum effective dose of the drugs, thus reducing their possible adverse effects and the costs of treatment.
