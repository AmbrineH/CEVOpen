<p class="p">We selected five electronic, evidence based DS resources at primarily two levels of representation: ingredient level (i.e., Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID), Natural Medicine (NM), Dietary Natural Health Products Ingredients Database (NHPID) and product level (i.e., Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) and Licensed Natural Health Products Database (LNHPD)). Each of these databases were built exclusively for DS representation and created/maintained by either government from USA (DSID, DSLD) or Canada (NHPID, LNHPD), and/or healthcare professionals (NM-USA). More standardized drug terminological systems with some representation of DS were excluded from our preliminary study to be evaluated as the next step.</p>
