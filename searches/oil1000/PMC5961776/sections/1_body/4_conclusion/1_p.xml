<p class="p">This pilot study evaluated and compared DS data elements coverage by five DS databases, both from the USA (NM, DSLD and DSID) and Canada (NHPID and LNHPD). A model based on LanguaL code and AHFS guidelines was generated and employed as a checklist. Across all five databases, we found fragmented and inconsistent distribution of DS representation with variability in data elements and as well as in the underlying content. This study unveils the gaps in existing DS supplement domain and provides us with an essential knowledge to be used as a platform to build more standardized DS terminology/ontology model.</p>
