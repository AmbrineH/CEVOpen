<p class="p">We observed varied levels of completeness in representation of DS across databases based on presence or absence of various data elements represented in the model. Several sections, such as title &amp; introductory information, dosage, purpose of use, cautions, have wider coverage across databases as compared to other sections, such as mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and packaging. These discrepancies have multiple possible causes. For one, ingredient and product level resources are meant for different purposes and users. For example, product level databases provide more packaging related information. Another possible cause is the fragmented and/or incomplete coverage across databases, e.g., NM is more comprehensive than DSID. Lexical variations were also observed in how data elements were referred to within a database, e.g., the terms “uses” and “purpose” employed interchangeably within NHPID. This variation was also observed across databases, e.g. use of term “adverse reactions” in NHPID/LNHPD vs. “adverse effects” in NM and use of word “purpose” in NHPID vs. “people use this for’ in NM. Some overlap was seen among content coverage especially under naming sections. For example, the Latin names Zingiber officinale and Panax ginseng are (Latin terms) labelled as scientific names under NM. Whereas, the term synonym or taxonomical synonym universally represents alternate names. Content pertaining to some of the above facets is often inferred from other data rather than mentioned implicitly and is therefore marked as available, e.g., under DSLD and DSID, route of administration (oral) could be inferred from dose form (tablet).</p>
