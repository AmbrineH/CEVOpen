<p id="Par32" class="p">For the sake of clarity, the present review has been structured in three main parts, covering the three fatty acids found in sea buckthorn oil: firstly, monounsaturated fatty acids omega-7 and omega-9 (palmitoleic acid, vaccenic acid and oleic acid), then, polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6 (linoleic acid and linolenic acid), and finally, the saturated fatty acids (stearic acid and palmitic acid). Each of these subheadings explains in more detail the characteristics of the relevant fatty acid: its chemical structure, its proportion (%) in the oil and its effects over human health in order of significance.</p>
