<p id="Par49" class="p">As mentioned above, a dietary deficiency in LA results in a characteristic scaly skin disorder and an excessive epidermal water loss. The physical structure of the epidermal water barrier is defined as a lipid bilayer, which fills the intracellular spaces of the upper-most layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum). This lipid bilayer contains sphingolipids; in turn, those sphingolipids rich in linoleate are called acylglucosylceramide, acylceramide and acylacid. Although the feeding of LA in fatty acid deficient animals is known to reverse the major coetaneous symptoms, the mechanisms by which this happened remain unknown. A possible mechanism is the transformation of LA into 13-hydroxioctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). This reaction may be produced by incubated LA with soybean 15-lipoxygenase or 15-lipoxygenase prepared from skin epidermis in vitro [

The same study also demonstrated that 13-HODE formed was incorporated into epidermal phosphatidylinsotiol 4, 5-biphosphate, resulting in epidermal phospholipasa C-catalyzed release of 13-HODE into a novel 13-HODE-containing diacylglycerol. These results were obtained thanks to an in vivo trial in which Guinea pigs were randomized in three groups depending on diet: safflower (control), essential fatty acid deficiency diet, and essential fatty acid diet followed by safflower oil during 2 weeks. The third group showed replenished tissue concentrations of 13-HODE after the introduction of safflower oil, which inversely correlated with the selective down-regulation of protein kinase Cβ. It is possible that this 13-HODE-containing-diacylglycerol could function to decrease the activity of epidermal protein kinase C and epidermal hyperproliferation and differentiation. These results suggest that the epidermal concentration of 13-HODE, which is derived from dietary LA, may play a role in modulating coetaneous hyperporliferation [
