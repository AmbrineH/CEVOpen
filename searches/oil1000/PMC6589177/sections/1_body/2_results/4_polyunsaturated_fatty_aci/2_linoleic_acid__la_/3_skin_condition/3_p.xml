<p id="Par50" class="p">Furthermore, LA seems to have an important role in the de novo biosynthesis of the major sebaceous fatty acids. An in vitro study of fatty acids from a biopsy punches from human facial skin rich in sebaceous glands was designed to try and elucidate the metabolisms of sebaceous lipids. Most fatty acids are esterified into triglycerides or polar lipids in sebaceous glands but LA is processed in a different way. It is hypothesized that LA is transformed into hydroxyperoxide by the lipoxygenase enzyme and this intermediate form is highly susceptible to Î²-oxidation. The results showed a correlation between the function and differentiation of sebaceous cells and the oxidation of LA. The study highlighted that the oxidation of LA is indispensable for the de novo biosynthesis of the major sebaceous fatty acids, such as palmitic and oleic acids [
