 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The lamellar granules of human skin produce lipids that maintain the protective barrier of the skin in order to avoid the epidermal loss of water. Zielsinska and colleagues (2014) affirm that the reproduction of lamellar granules slows down with aging, the skin becoming drier and weaker [

Omega-6 might reverse this process by accelerating the production of lipids in lamellar granules, strengthening the lipid barrier of the epidermis, protecting the skin against epidermal loss of water, and normalizing the metabolism of the skin [

In addition, it is thought that LA might improve sebaceous gland activity, unblocking pores and decreasing the number of comedos [
