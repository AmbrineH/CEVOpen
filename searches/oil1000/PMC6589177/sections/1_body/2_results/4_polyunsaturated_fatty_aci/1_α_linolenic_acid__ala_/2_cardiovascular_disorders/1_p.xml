<p id="Par42" class="p">The potent cardio protective activity of ALA has been researched in many studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. EFSA authorized a health claim which affirms the contribution of ALA to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. It is suggested that this effect is due to the ability of ALA to form precursors such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the human body. However, ALA may have an impact upon health independently to its precursor role. Its cardio protective effects may be due to various mechanisms, such as the reduction of plaque calcification and the number of lipids, the maintenance of endothelial function, the reduction of blood pressure and the exhibition of antithrombotic, anti arrhythmic and anti-inflammatory effects [
