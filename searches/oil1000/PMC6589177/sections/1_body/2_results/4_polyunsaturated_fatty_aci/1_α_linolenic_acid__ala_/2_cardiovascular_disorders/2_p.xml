<p id="Par43" class="p">Several clinical trials have tried to demonstrate all these effects. Djoussé and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] carried out a cohort study where there was associated an inverse and dose-dependent relation between dietary ALA (range, 0.17 to 3.48 g/d) and prevalent calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (CAC). The presence of CAC is directly associated with the total burden of atherosclerotic plaques and its vulnerability. Consequently, the reduction of the presence of CAC decreases the risk of atherosclerosis, and viceversa [

Furthermore, a cross-over study with moderate hypercholesterolemic subjects was conducted to prove the influence of the diet in the inflammation process in cardiovascular disease. The three diets designed in this study were: American diet (control diet), a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and ALA (ALA diet) and a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and LA (LA diet). The subjects were assigned to a sequence of these 3 test diets: they consumed a diet for 6 weeks and before starting the other diet they had a break period of 3 weeks. The results showed that ALA diet decreased C-reactive protein, a protein involved in the atherosclerotic process. Also, ALA diet decreased vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin compared to control diet. The 2 high-PUFA diets decreased serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and TAG. In addition, ALA diet decreased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI more than American diet and increased EPA levels in serum. The research concluded that a diet rich in ALA plays a role in reducing multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors such as decreasing pro inflammatory cytokines, changes in VCAM-1, lowering cholesterol levels or increasing EPA levels in serum [

Another cardio protective effect mentioned is the ability of ALA to reduce blood pressure. A study published in the 
 <italic class="italic">Journal of Olea Science</italic> evaluated the antihypertensive activity of ALA in subjects with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension. The subjects were divided in two groups: a group which consumed 14 g of common blended oil and a group that intake ALA-enriched oil. The results revealed a significant decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the ALA-enriched group compared to the control group. The study concluded that ALA had an antihypertensive effect on blood pressure with no adverse effect during the study.
