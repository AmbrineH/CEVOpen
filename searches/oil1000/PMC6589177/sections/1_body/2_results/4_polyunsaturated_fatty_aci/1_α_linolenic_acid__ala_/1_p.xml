<p id="Par41" class="p">ALA (18:3) is an unsaturated omega-3 fatty acid composed by 18 carbons and three 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> double bonds. It must be acquired through diet because it is an essential fatty acid and it is an isomer of GLA. It is found mostly in seed oil – 20-35% – and even though it is also present in the soft parts of the berries, the proportion is lower [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. As in the other cases of aforementioned fatty acids, the proportion of ALA is different according to the subspecies. ALA shows a variation, with a higher average proportion in 
 <italic class="italic">subsp. rhamnoides</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">subsp. sinnensis.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. ALA and GLA have an important role in the human organism (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). They are a physiological component of cell membranes and mitochondria membranes and they play a role in the mechanism of cell transportation and the transmission of neuronal signals [
