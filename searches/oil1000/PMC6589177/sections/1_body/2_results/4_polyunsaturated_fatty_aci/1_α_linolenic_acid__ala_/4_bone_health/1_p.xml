<p id="Par45" class="p">The potential effect of ALA regarding the protection of bone is being evaluated. A study assessed the relation of bone mineral density biomarker (N-telopeptides) and different diets. The results showed a significant decreased of N-telopeptids in the case of rich-ALA diet and rich-LA diet compared to the control diet. The study concluded that ALA and LA may play an important role in bone turnover and maintenance of bone formation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] also carried out a study among 1865 females to investigate the role of the diet in bone heath. Bone mineral density, Ward’s triangle, femoral trochanter, hip and lumbar were measured by X ray. The dietary intakes of total energy, calcium, vitamin D, ALA, EPA, DHA, LA and arachidonic acid were assessed by a food questionnaire. The authors found positive correlations between ALA, EPA and DHA with bone mineral density [
