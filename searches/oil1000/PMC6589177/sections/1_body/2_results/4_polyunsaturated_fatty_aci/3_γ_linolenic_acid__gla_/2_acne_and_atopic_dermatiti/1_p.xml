<p id="Par54" class="p">In relation to skin disorders, Jung and colleagues’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] study suggested that GLA could improve acne disease. Forty-five acne skin patients were divided in two different groups according to diet supplement. The supplements were omega-3 (group 1), GLA (group 2) and control group. The results obtained showed a significant reduction of the mean of inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesion in the groups 1 and 2 compared to the control group. Visual analogue scale was established at the beginning of the study, and it was also reduced in these two groups. Furthermore, interleukin 8, a type of interleukin presented in high levels in acne lesions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>], decreased significantly in the treatment groups. The study concluded by proposing two GLA possible mechanisms that may improve 
 <italic class="italic">acne vulgaris.</italic> The first one consists in modulating the inflammatory process. GLA is converted in dihome-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), a substrate of cyclo-oxygenase and 15-lypoxygenase. These two enzymes catalyze the production of prostaglandin E1 and 15-hydroxydihomo-γ-linolenic acid (15-OH-DGLA), which have anti-inflammatory properties. In the second one, 15-OH-DGLA can improve the hyper proliferative skin condition by the modulation of the protein kinase C [
