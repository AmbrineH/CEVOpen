<p id="Par55" class="p">The beneficial effects of PUFA on atopic dermatitis have been discussed for almost century. A double-blind, randomized-controlled trial investigated the effect of supplementation of borage oil (containing 100â€‰mg of GLA) in infants with a maternal history of atopic disease. In this case, the study was not based on trying to elucidate the therapeutic effects in relation to atopic disease; instead, it focused on a possible protective role of GLA in the development of atopic dermatitis in infants with atopic mothers. The results showed an increase of GLA and phospholipids concentration in plasma in the treatment group, which were negatively associated with the severity of atopic dermatitis when infants were 1-year-old. However, there were not significant differences in total serum IGE concentration between the two groups. The study concluded that the supplementation of GLA as a treatment seemed to be favorable but not significant. Instead, when GLA is used as a marker of compliance, the severity of AD is strongly negatively associated with increase of GLA in infants. Finally, the authors suggested that an early supplementation with GLA in children tend to alleviate the severity of atopic dermatitis in later infancy [
