<p id="Par56" class="p">In regard to dry eye disorders, a study researched the effect of ALA and GLA on meibomian gland dysfunction. The meibomian glands are situated inside the eyelids, and when a blockage of this gland exists, the oily part of the tears cannot be released, producing an acceleration of the drying of the eyes and generating irritation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>] designed a study where subjects were divided into 3 groups. A group consumed ALA (28,5 mg) and GLA (15 mg) tablets; B group was subjected to eyelid hygiene and C group received both treatments. All treatments were once daily for 180 days. Although the three treatments presented a significant improvement in symptoms, the C group was the most efficient. The administration of GLA and LA (A group) decreased the secretion turbidity and the meibomian gland obstruction. When it was combined with eyelid hygiene (C group) it showed, in addition, a reduction in eyelid edema, foam collection in the tear meniscus and corneal staining. The study suggested a dual effect of omega-6 fatty acids in the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction. On the one hand, the anti-inflammatory activity may contribute to reducing eyelid edema. On the other, it may produce a less dense and turbid meibomian secretion by modifying the lipid composition. Thus, it may increase the efficacy of eyelid hygiene [

Another study carried out with a dry eye rat model revealed that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids prevented the clinical signs of chronic corneal dryness and prevented the loss of musincs in the conjunctival epithelium. Only the rats treated with a combination of omega-6 and omega-3 decreased the expression of MHC II (inflammatory marker) on the conjunctival epithelium. The authors concluded that a combination of omega-3 and GLA fatty acids may be more successful in the treatment of dry eyes than the application of only one of them [
