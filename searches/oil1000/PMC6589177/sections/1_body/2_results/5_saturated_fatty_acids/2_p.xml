<p id="Par58" class="p">Saturated fatty acids (stearic and palmitic) are not known to reveal a beneficial effect in human health if they are taken orally. However, they may be interesting if they are administrated topically due to its molecular structure. Saturated fatty acids are characterized for not containing any double bond in its chain. This distinctive aspect affects in its form, tending to be more solid than unsaturated fatty acids, and consequently being more occlusive. Its occlusive properties may be beneficial in skin disorders that develop dehydrated skin. Thanks to this property, saturated fatty acids form a protective barrier in the skin valuable in clinical application for two different reasons. On one hand, the barrier formed prevents the skin loss of water and, on the other hand, it facilitates the absorption of other bioactive compounds of the oil, such as the rest of fatty acids.</p>
