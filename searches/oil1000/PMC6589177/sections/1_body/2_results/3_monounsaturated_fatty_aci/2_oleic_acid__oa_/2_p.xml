<p id="Par40" class="p">Although olive oil is the most well-known oil containing a high proportion of this fatty acid, there are other oils originating from plants such as sea buckthorn in which OA is also abundant. The Mediterranian diet is rich in OA due to the fact that one of the principal sources of fat is the olive oil, and there exist a strong association between a Mediterranean-style diet and protection for cardiovascular disease. Several studies show that OA decreases the expression of cell adhesion molecules in the endothelium [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Carluccio and colleagues (1998) research the effect of OA on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in an in vitro study. The results reveal that OA works as an inhibitor of endothelial activation reducing the atherosclerotic risk. A possible mechanism to explain these antiatherogenic properties is the effect of OA in the expression on monocyte adhesion accounted for by an inhibition of mRNA and, upstream, by inhibition of NF-kB activation after endothelial cell stimulation. In addition, other mechanisms related on the lipid profile or other cardiovascular risk factor may exist [
