Although an extensive range of treatments exist for this disorder –such as systemic and local estrogens, local testosterone, systemic and local corticoids, retinoid, anti-inflammatory ointment or surgery– these treatments are frequently inefficient. For this reason, alternative options such as the sea buckthorn application have been researched. For instance, a study published on Agro Food Industry Hi-Tech focuses on the oral administration of 3 capsules of omega-7 sea buckthorn to 5 patients twice a day during 12 weeks. The results of the study show a considerable improvement of chronic vaginal inflammatory atrophy in three cases. However, in the two least severe cases the improvement was less obvious. The mechanisms of omega-7 did not take place through an increase of circulating estrogen level, and it could therefore be an alternative to this treatment. Nonetheless, the number of patients recruited was small and more clinical trials are needed [
