<p id="Par38" class="p">Another effect of PA investigated in the study of Souza and colleagues (2016) is the possible relation between PA and hepatic insulin sensitivity. The design of the study consists in two groups of mice, one of them were fed a high-fat diet and the other a standard diet for 12 weeks. In the last 2 weeks, the high-fat diet mice were treated daily with oleic acid or palmitic acid. After 12 weeks, the mice were injected with insulin or vehicle and various parameters were analyzed. The study concluded that PA supplementation in mice fed with high-fat diet stimulated the uptake of glucose and impaired the lipogenesis in liver by activation of AMPk and FGF-21, dependent on PPAR-α. All these effects are essential to control insulin resistance and to reduce the ectopic deposition of lipids in the liver. The study also suggested that PA plays an important role as a non-pharmacological treatment for diabetes and liver dysfunctions. Moreover, it highlighted an increased lipolysis and a decreased lipogenesis in adipocytes. Additionally, the immunity system was seen to be affected by PA, which decreased NF-kB p65 phosphorylation and proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages [

This fatty acid promoted a suppressive effect in isolated human lymphocyte proliferation characterized by a decrease of Th1 and Th17 response, and co-stimulatory molecule (CD28) [
