<p id="Par35" class="p">Another study focusing on the vaginal inflammatory atrophy suggested a daily oral intake of 3â€‰g of sea buckthorn oil, where the main fatty acid was PA (24%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. A total of 116 postmenopausal women were randomized into two groups: in the first one they were administered sea buckthorn, while in the second one they were administered placebo. The results of the study indicate a positive increasing trend of the vaginal health index for the sea buckthorn group [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>] tried to determine the inhibition activity of the PA versus three melanogenic keys enzymes in murine B16 melanoma cells. These enzymes were tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2) and microphtalmina-associated transcription factor (MITF). The results showed an inhibition of tyrosinase, TRP-2 and MITF, and consequently PA is proposed as a potential anti-melanogenic agent and effective in hyperpigmentation disorders [
