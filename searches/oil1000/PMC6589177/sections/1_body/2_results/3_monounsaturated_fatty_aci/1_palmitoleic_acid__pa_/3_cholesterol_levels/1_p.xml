<p id="Par37" class="p">Moreover, PA seems to have an important role in lowering cholesterol levels. A study compares the effects of diet in regard to hypercholesterolemia in rats. The rats were distributed in six groups with different diets rich in either palmitate, stearate, palmitoleate, oleate, linoleate or α-linoleate. The palmitoleate was found to be as effective as linoleate in lowering the plasma cholesterol level. In addition, when it was compared to oleate and to other saturated acids, the palmitoleate was clearly more hypercholesterolemic. The mechanism of its activity remains unknown, but since there has been observed a high activity of lecitin cholesterol acil transferasa (LCAT) in rats fed with palmitoleate [

In addition, a controlled trial with PA associated PA to a significant decrease in TAG and LDL-cholesterol, as well as to a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol in subjects with hyperlipidemia compared to the control group over 30 days [
