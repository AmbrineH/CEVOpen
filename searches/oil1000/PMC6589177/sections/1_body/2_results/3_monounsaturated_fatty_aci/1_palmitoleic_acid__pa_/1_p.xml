<p id="Par33" class="p">PA (16:1) is an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid very uncommon within the plant kingdom. Consequently, it is very difficult to introduce it in the human diet through vegetable food sources. Sea buckthorn is one of the few plants that present this fatty acid. Specifically, PA is only found in the soft part of the berry [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>] the oil obtained from the pulp and peel of the sea buckthorn contains high levels of PA –up to 43%– [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. The composition of the fatty acid may be different according to its origin, subspecies or harvesting time. Some studies reveal that sea buckthorn originated in Central Asia and the Baltic region contained a higher proportion of PA in the TAG of the berry mescocarp than the ones originated in the Caucas. Another study compares the composition of omega-7 fatty acids in pulp/peel (palmitoleic and vaccenic acids) between the
