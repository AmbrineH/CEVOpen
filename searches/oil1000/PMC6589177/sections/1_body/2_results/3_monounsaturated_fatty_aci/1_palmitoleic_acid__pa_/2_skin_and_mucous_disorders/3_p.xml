<p id="Par36" class="p">Another effect of PA in skin and mucous is related to the human sebum. Human sebum consists mostly of triglycerides, wax esters and squalene, and its composition is characteristic of and unique to sebaceous cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Sebum does account for the self-disinfecting activity at the skin surface, and PA accounts for most of this activity. Wille &amp; Kydonieus (2002) carried out an in vitro study based on collected skin surface lipids and investigated its antimicrobial activity. The results revealed that the PA at concentrations below 0.5 mg/ml had little effect on the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> and at concentrations above 1.0 mg/ml were effective in preventing the attachment of pathogenic yeast cells to isolated sheets of mammalian stratum corneum. Due to its potential activity against the adhesion of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> to the skin, PA is included as a medical preventive treatment for wound infections and catheter coatings. However, this fatty acid is not effective in gram-negative bacteria. The authors highlight the possibility that PA may be a natural antimicrobial gram-positive bacteria of the skin [

 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</italic>. The selective bactericidal ability of PA calcium salt is a suitable property for an ingredient of cosmetic products because, in some cases, a higher bactericidal action affecting all types of bacteria is not always the best option for human skin [
