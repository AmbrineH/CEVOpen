<p id="Par26" class="p">From a nutritional standpoint, fatty acids have an important role in several metabolic and structural functions. They are indispensable compounds of the cell membranes, are responsible for the transport of vitamins, and regulate the concentration of lipids in plasma. Furthermore, fatty acids produce a number of precursors such as eicosanoides, decosanoides, steroid hormones and biliary acid, all of them fundamental for the adequate functioning of the metabolism. In addition, they are the most important energetic nutrient –it is currently recommended that at least 20% of the total energy intake should derive from lipids–.</p>
