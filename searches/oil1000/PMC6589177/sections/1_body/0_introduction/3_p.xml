<p id="Par27" class="p">As already mentioned, a number of studies have revealed that fatty acids are very diverse, each type of them having different effects over the organism. So far, the fatty acids found to be most beneficial are those presenting an even number of carbons (4 to 30) and instaurations, which are mainly found in marine species. However, lately it has also been highlighted that some plants, such as sea buckthorn, also contain abundant and valuable fatty acids (especially in their seeds) with high nutritional value, as well as useful for several clinical applications. In particular, sea buckthorn is a perfect natural vegetable source to obtain a wide range of fatty acids, especially essential and unsaturated fatty acids, both the most beneficial for human health. It is a plant that is composed of different bioactive compounds, which may also be found in other medicinal plants. The characteristic that makes sea buckthorn unique is the qualitative and quantitative composition of its fatty acids, particularly the presence of the fatty acid omega-7 group, higher than in any other plant.</p>
