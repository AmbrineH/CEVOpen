<p id="Par29" class="p">The aim of this review is to demonstrate the clinical application of fatty acids present in sea buckthorn oil. Sea buckthorn was the source selected to demonstrate these positive effects due to its variety and unusual fatty acids in its composition compared to other plants. In general, the studies focused on the fatty acid from sea buckthorn oil are limited and, for this reason, in most cases it has been necessary to classify the different fatty acids presents in the oil composition and reveal their benefits separately Hence, the review will show the clinical application of fatty acids that sea buckthorn oil composes independently of its origin.</p>
