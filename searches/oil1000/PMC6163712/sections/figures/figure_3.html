 <p> Concentration-dependent ((Âµg/mL(log)) effect curves for the larval migration test (%) using nematodes of sheep, with the interaction of ( a) ivermectin alone (triangle) or in combination with the IC 50 of OFIEOH (circle); and ( b) OFIEOH alone (triangle) or in combination with the IC 50 of ivermectin (circle), obtained from the peels of Opuntia ficus-indica. IC 50 = Inhibitory concentration of 50% of larvae. </p>
