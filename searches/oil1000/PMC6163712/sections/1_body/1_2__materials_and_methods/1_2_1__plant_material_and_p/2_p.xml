<p class="p">Initially, the cladodes of the plants were separated into distinct parts: peel and pulp. The peels (2.1 kg) were cut into different sizes and subsequently dried in an oven at 40 °C for 72 h. To prepare the hydroalcoholic extract, 191.5 g of peels, corresponding to the entire dried material and 1 L of 80% ethanol were conditioned in a glass flask protected from light. The mixture was kept under maceration at 4 °C for 21 days. During this period, extractive solvent exchanges were performed on days 7 and 14. On day 21, the extract was pooled, filtered and evaporated on a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. After that, the extract was freeze-dried, corresponding to the OFIEOH. OFIEOH presented a yield of 9% in relation to the dry plant material (dry cladode peels). OFIEOH was resuspended in water for the in vitro tests.</p>
