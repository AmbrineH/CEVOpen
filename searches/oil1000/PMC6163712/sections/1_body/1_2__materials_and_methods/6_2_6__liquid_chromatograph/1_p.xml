<p class="p">LC-MS/ESI was used to characterize the polyphenolic profile of the OFIEOH extract. The analysis was conducted using an Agilent 1200 series coupled with a triple quadrupole MS series 6400 (Santa Clara, CA, USA). Separation was performed using a C18 reverse-phase column (150 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) Shim-Pack CLC-ODS (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 25 °C. The mobile phase for the HPLC was prepared with acetonitrile (99.98% purity) from J.T. Baker (Xalostoc, Mexico), and Merck’s formic acid (≥99%). The mobile phase consisted of 0.5% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) using the following gradients: 0–10 min: 10% B; 10–20 min: 10–30% B; 20–30 min: 30–50% B; 30–32 min: 50% B; 32–38 min: 50–10% B; 38–48 min: 10% B [

Before the analysis with LC-MS/ESI, 1 mg/mL of OFIEOH extract was eluted through the C18 cartridges (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to remove low-molecular-weight compounds. The parameters for ESI were as follows: nebulizer at 50 psi, 4500 V, arrest gas (N2) flow at 11 L/min, and an ionization temperature of 350 °C. The ion trap mass spectrometer was operated in a negative ion mode with a full scanning range from
