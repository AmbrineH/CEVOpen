<p class="p">The dosage of condensed tannins was performed using sulfuric vanillin as a reagent, by a method described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B18-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Aliquots of 1 mL of OFIEOH at 5 mg/mL concentration in distilled water were mixed with 2 mL of 2% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) sulfuric vanillin solution. The mixture was kept in a water bath at 20 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of 200 μL were transferred to a 96-well microplate and the absorbance was measured at 500 nm. Commercial epicatechin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for the standard curve, and the concentrations ranged from 1.25 to 30 μg/mL (R
