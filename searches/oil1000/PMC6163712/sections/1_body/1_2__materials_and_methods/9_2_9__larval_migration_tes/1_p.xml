 <xref rid="B22-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], with adaptations. Initially, the sheath was removed from the infective third-stage larvae (L3) using 0.3% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) sodium hypochlorite for 1 h. Subsequently, L3 were washed three times by centrifugation (at 140× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min) with distilled water and then quantified to add in 24-well plates (approximately 200 larvae/well). The concentrations of OFIEOH were 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/mL. Each concentration was tested in triplicate. The first incubation was for 6 h at 27 °C. After that, all solutions containing the larvae, extract, positive, and negative control were transferred to previously prepared apparatus. These apparatuses were incubated for the second time, at 27 °C, under a 150 MHz light source to stimulate larval motility. After 18 h, the solution was transferred to 50 mL tubes and centrifuged at 140× 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 2 min. A 2 mL aliquot was transferred from the decantation of each well into a 24-well plate. Larval counts were performed under optical microscopy (10×). The average number of migrating L3 at each concentration was transformed into a percentage by the GraphPad Prism 7 program. We used IVM (114.3 µM) as a positive control and the negative control was prepared with distilled water.
