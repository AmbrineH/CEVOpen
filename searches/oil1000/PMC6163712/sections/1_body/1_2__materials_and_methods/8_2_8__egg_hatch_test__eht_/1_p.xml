 <xref rid="B20-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], with modifications. After washing, recovery, and quantification of the eggs, approximately 100 eggs in suspension were added per well into a 24-well plate and mixed with the OFIEOH prepared in distilled water at final concentrations of 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/mL, in a total volume of 1 mL. We performed the experiment using triplicate samples for each concentration. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 27 °C and egg counts were used to calculate the egg hatch percentage using the following formula: Egg hatchability (%) = L1/(eggs + L1) × 100, where L1 corresponds to first stage larvae. The larval count was done on an inverted microscope. The average number of hatched eggs at each concentration was transformed into a percentage by the GraphPad Prism 7 program. The positive control was made using IVM (114.3 µM), solubilized in hot water. The negative control was prepared with distilled water.
