<p class="p">Prior authorization for the use of animals was obtained from the Ethical Committee for the Use of Animals of the Federal University of Parana (UFPR), under the number 008/2016. Fecal samples were obtained from 10 naturally infected sheep of the Sheep and Goats Research Unit, located at the Canguiri Farm of UFPR. The feces were collected directly from the rectum of previously selected sheep, with fecal egg counts higher than 1600 eggs. The eggs were cleaned from the fecal material according to an adaptation of a method proposed by reference [
 <xref rid="B20-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], where 20 g of feces were initially weighed, macerated and homogenized in warm water at 28 °C. Then, the samples were washed and filtered through 400, 250, 150, 75 and 25 μm aperture sieves in order to recover the eggs. In the last sieve, the eggs were washed with distilled water and centrifuged in 50 mL Falcon tubes at 140×
