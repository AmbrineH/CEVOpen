 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-Glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to prepare a standard curve with concentrations from 4 to 40 µg/mL (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9958). OFIEOH was solubilized in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O at 1 mg/mL and 40 µL of this solution was transferred to 2 mL microtubes in triplicate. After that, 40 μL of 5% phenol (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was mixed with the solutions. Subsequently, 200 μL of concentrated sulfuric acid (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) was added. The solution was heated at 100 °C for 10 min and then cooled in ice-bath. After that, 200 μL of the solution was transferred to a 96-well reading plate and the absorbance was measured, at 490 nm, on a microplate reader spectrophotometer EPOCH-ELX800 (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). In this assay, carbohydrates react with sulfuric acid undergoing dehydration and complexation with phenol, generating a yellow-orange coloration. The assay was performed in triplicates.
