<p class="p">The protein content was determined using the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), as previously described [
 <xref rid="B16-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. First, the standard dose curve was set with bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with a sensitivity limit from 4 to 40 µg/mL (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9952). Subsequently, OFIEOH was solubilized in distilled H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O at 1 mg/mL concentration. Aliquots of 40 μL of OFIEOH were transferred to microtubes, then 400 μL of the Bradford reagent was added. After shaking, 200 μL was transferred to a 96-well microplate and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
