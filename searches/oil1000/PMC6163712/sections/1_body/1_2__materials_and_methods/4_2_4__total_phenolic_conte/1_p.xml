<p class="p">The total phenolic content was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B17-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The standard curve was prepared using solutions of gallic acid at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 µg/mL (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9516). Aliquots (250 µL) of OFIEOH at 1 mg/mL concentration in H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O were added to test tubes. Next, 1.5 mL of the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent [10% (

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) in distilled H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O] obtained from Chromato (São Paulo, Brazil) was added. The tubes were shaken, and then 1 mL of 7.5% (
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) was added to the solutions. After heating in a water bath at 50 °C for 5 min, aliquots of 200 μL were transferred to a 96-well microplate. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm. The principle of the method is that the reaction between the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and phenolic compounds results in the formation of a blue complex. This reaction was favored by an alkaline pH medium, obtained by the addition of carbonate. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
