<p class="p">Distinct biological activities of the cactus pear including hypoglycaemic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiulcer and anti-inflammatory have been described [

 <xref rid="B12-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. These biological properties usually have been related to the phenolic content profile present in the plant [

 <xref rid="B11-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. According to reference [
 <xref rid="B11-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], the anthelminthic activity expressed by this plant is attributed to the sum of the effects of phytochemicals such as saponins flavonoids, plant pigments, and tannins. However, as mentioned above, there is a need to further investigate some of these gaps to enable the use of
