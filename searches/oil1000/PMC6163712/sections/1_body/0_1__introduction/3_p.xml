 <xref rid="B8-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], the aim of this work was to perform a phytochemical characterization of the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ficus-indica</italic> cladode peels (OFIEOH), as well as to perform in vitro egg hatch and larval migration tests to determine its efficacy against gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep. The OFIEOH was also used in combination with ivermectin (IVM), a product from the macrocyclic lactone family, to determine potential drug-extract interaction.
