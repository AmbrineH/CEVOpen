<p class="p">Regarding the content of condensed tannins from the OFIEOH, it corresponded to 1.20 mg of epicatechin equivalent/g of dry extract concentration. Of note, it is important to mention that despite the significant phenolic content, other components that were not tannins were predominantly present in OFIEOH. Other studies with 
 <italic class="italic">O. ficus-indica</italic> extracts described variations of tannin contents from 1.2 to 3.2 mg of proanthocyanidins/g dry extract [
 <xref rid="B23-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. According to reference [
 <xref rid="B14-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], using extracts from fruit skin and seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Opuntia</italic> spp., the authors found that tannins were the main phenolic compounds, representing almost 50% of the total contents. Similarly, according to reference [
 <xref rid="B11-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], it was verified that large amounts of tannins, as well as alkaloids and flavonoids were present in extracts from crude cladodes and ethanolic extracts of fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">O. ficus-indica</italic>. This variation demonstrated that different portions of the plant could also affect the phytochemical composition. As mentioned before, different cultivation and climatic conditions can influence the composition of plant constituents [
 <xref rid="B23-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This information also underscores the importance of studies using different fractions of plants, with the objectives to improve their activity and to identify their major components.
