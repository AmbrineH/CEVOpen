<p class="p">Phenolic compounds fall into several categories such as simple phenols, phenolic acids (derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids), coumarins, flavonoids, stilbenes, condensed, and hydrolysates tannins and lignins [
 <xref rid="B31-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Flavonoids represent one of the major classes of plant phenols and are found as many variations such as flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavanols or catechins, anthocyanins, isoflavones, chalcones and dihydrochalcones [
 <xref rid="B32-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. From the subclass of the flavonols, quercetins (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) can be found in the aglycone forms or, more commonly, in the form of glycosides and/or as methylated or acylated derivatives [
 <xref rid="B32-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Quercetin is known for having a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and it has been associated with the prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases and cancer [
 <xref rid="B33-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Although polyphenolic compounds, such as tannins, have anthelmintic effects, the antiparasitic capacity of quercetins has been recently studied [

 <xref rid="B35-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. According to reference [
 <xref rid="B36-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia campestris</italic>, a plant rich in quercetin derivatives, was evaluated using in vitro tests and presented 100% inhibition of the egg hatch rate and larval motility of 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> at a dose of 2 mg/mL of the extract. Similarly, reference [
 <xref rid="B37-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] reported that quercetin and kaempferol present in the extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Bridelia ferruginea</italic> bark caused the mortality of 
 <italic class="italic">Fasciola gigantica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Taenia solium</italic> larvae in less than 62 min., demonstrating its use as an anthelmintic plant.
