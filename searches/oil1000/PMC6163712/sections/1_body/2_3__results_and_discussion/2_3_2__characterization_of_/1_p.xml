<p class="p">To characterize the contents of the phenolic compounds of OFIEOH extract, the sample was analyzed by LC-MS-ESI. Polyphenolic compounds were identified by comparing the resultant data with the available data [

The phenolic compounds identified corresponded to methyl, glycosylated and aglycone quercetin derivatives and aglycone and glycosylated kaempferol derivatives. The main compounds (peaks 17, 18, and 19) (molecular ion at 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>: 769), present in the OFIEOH, were identified as tri-glycosylated methyl quercetin derivatives, with a sugar portion consisting of two deoxyhexose and one hexose. According to the literature, these derivatives can be isorhamnetin-3-

 <xref rid="B30-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Tri-glycosylated quercetin (such as quercetin-3-neohesperidoside-7-rhamnoside) (with two deoxyhexose and one hexose) (peaks 20 and 21,

 <italic class="italic">z</italic> 593 was identified as kaempferol-3-
