<p class="p">Analyzing the interaction curves between IVM and OFIEOH, we observed that the inclusion of the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of OFIEOH (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 25.65 mg/mL) and the different doses of IVM (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 27.86 mg/mL) did not contribute to the efficacy of the extract, showing a neutral antagonist effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vetsci-05-00080-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a). The mechanism of interaction, in this case, was probably by limiting their independent intrinsic activity, with no addition of the individual efficacy (superimposed curves). The addition of the IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of IVM plus the different doses of OFIEOH (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 55.08 mg/mL) presented a statistically significant difference (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) additive effect, when compared to the effect of the extract alone (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> 82.79 mg/ml), increasing the efficacy of the extract on the larvae (

 <xref rid="B43-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], similar to our study, a synergistic effect was verified by reference [
 <xref rid="B44-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] that evaluated the effect of drug interactions between a natural product (dehydrated garlicâ€”
 <italic class="italic">Allium sativa</italic>) and two commercially available anthelmintics (levamisole and IVM), against sheep nematodes. Our results showed that OFIEOH plus IVM increased L3 inhibition by 1.5 times. A synergistic effect was also observed by reference [
 <xref rid="B22-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] when using IVM in combination with verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, with LMT and [
 <xref rid="B45-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] in vivo, against 
 <italic class="italic">H. contortus</italic> naturally infected sheep. The effect of the combination of phenolic compounds and/or flavonoids with commercial drugs to control gastrointestinal parasites of livestock still has to be extensively tested to secure maximum animal safety.
