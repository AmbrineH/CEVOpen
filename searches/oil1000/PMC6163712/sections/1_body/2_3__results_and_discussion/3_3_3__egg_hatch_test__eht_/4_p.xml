<p class="p">Tannin-rich plants have been used against gastrointestinal parasites and have highlighted the direct effects of tannins by promoting structural alterations in the parasites, reducing the development of the larval stages and by compromising the fertility of females and egg integrity (hatchability) [

Thus, the findings of the present work suggest that other phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, may also exert antiparasitic activity, alone or in combination. According to reference [

 <xref rid="B36-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], there is a possibility of synergistic effects among compounds, such as quercetin derivatives, which was verified by the high concentration used in our study. The synergistic effect among plant ingredients was also verified by reference [
