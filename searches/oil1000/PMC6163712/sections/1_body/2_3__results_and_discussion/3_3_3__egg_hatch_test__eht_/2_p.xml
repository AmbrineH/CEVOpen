<p class="p">Positive inhibition of the egg hatch rate was also verified by reference [

 <italic class="italic">O. ficus-indica</italic>. In their study, the authors found an efficacy of 93% using 100 mg/mL of the extract. The value was very similar to the present study (90%). In the same study, the authors found the cladode extract to be even more effective using the LMT. We found very different results (IC

 <xref rid="B11-vetsci-05-00080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] using the larval inhibition assay (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 0.74 mg/mL) but using twice as much of the extract. This may have some therapeutic implications but we want to perform new experiments to improve the present data.
