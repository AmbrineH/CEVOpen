<p class="p">The OFIEOH from cladode peels is composed mostly of phenolic compounds belonging to the flavonoid class, including aglycone, methyl and glycosylated quercetin derivatives, aglycone, and glycosylated kaempferol derivatives. The tri-glycosylated methyl quercetin derivative was the main compound identified in the OFIEOH. The extract had a concentration-dependent effect, in which a clear gradual reduction of the egg hatch rate and larval motility was observed. The interaction effects between OFIEOH alone and when it was used in different concentrations with the addition of LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of IVM was antagonistic neutral. The results of IVM alone or in association with LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of OFIEOH showed an additive effect, improving the absolute efficacy by 1.5 times. Although the extract itself demonstrated to have a promising chance as a biofriendly antiparasiticide, new studies should be carried out to maximize its effectiveness, including the positive outcome of drug combinations, with the objective to reduce the amount of product that would be given to the final host.
