<p class="p">Walnut oil also maintained the histological architecture of the testes, increased the proliferative activity of spermatogonia, and maintained cells of the spermatogenic series when compared to controls. Walnut has been reported to contain reasonable amounts of zinc and vitamin E (

This protective nature of walnut is enhanced by some of its phytochemical constituents, namely zinc and vitamin E, known for protecting cell membranes and for their scavenging effects on free radicals. In clinical trials, vitamin E supplementation has been found to increase fertilization rates possibly by improving membrane integrity and decreasing oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation potential (
