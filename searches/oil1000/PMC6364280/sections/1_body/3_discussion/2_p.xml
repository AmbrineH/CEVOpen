<p class="p">The link between ROS and reduced motility may be due to a cascade of events that result in rapid loss of intracellular ATP leading to axonemal damage and sperm immobilization (

Our investigation also demonstrated that exposure to nitrite decreased testosterone concentrations, indicating interference with steroidogenesis. Administration of walnut oil increased testosterone levels and indicated the positive effect of walnut oil on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. The hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis can be affected by various negative and positive feedback mechanisms. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the factors affecting this axis. High levels of arginine in walnut can be converted to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide increases the release of GnRH, which in turn increases gonadotropin secretion by activating the production of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the pituitary gland (

The competitive mechanism of interaction is a plausible mechanism of protection offered by walnut oil against nitrite toxicity.
