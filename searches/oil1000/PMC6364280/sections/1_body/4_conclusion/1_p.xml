<p class="p">In conclusion, we found that walnut oil effectively lowered nitrite-induced oxidative stress by reducing MDA levels and ameliorated the deleterious effects of nitrite on serum testosterone levels; however, it had no effect on serum FSH and LH levels, depleted the germinal epithelium, and caused hypocellularity and widening of the interstitium. Walnut oil did not only promote germinal epithelial growth, but also protected the cytoarchitecture of the testes from the damaging effects of nitrite. Walnut oil thus augmented spermatogenesis and defeated nitrite-induced oxidative stress through an antioxidant system of activities.</p>
