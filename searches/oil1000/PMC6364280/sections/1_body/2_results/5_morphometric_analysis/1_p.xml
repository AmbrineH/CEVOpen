<p class="p">After the 28 days of the study, the volume density of germinal epithelium of controls (64.90±0.89) was significantly different from that of the rats given nitrite (58.08±0.33) (

However, there was a significant increase in the walnut oil (69.18±0.37) and nitrite + walnut oil (70.66±0.22) groups when compared to controls (64.90±0.89) and rats given nitrite alone (58.08±0.33). Lumen density significantly decreased in the nitrite group (9.60±0.23) compared to the control group (15.42±0.20). The interstitium had a significant increase in the nitrite group (26.73±0.21) when compared to controls (21.06±0.26). Significant decreases were also seen in the interstitium of the rats in the walnut oil (16.91±0.27) and nitrite + walnut oil (20.39±0.17) groups compared to the nitrite group (26.73±0.21) (
