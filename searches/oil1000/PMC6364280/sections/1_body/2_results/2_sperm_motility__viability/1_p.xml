<p class="p">Nitrite treatment significantly decreased sperm count, motility, and viability in the nitrite group compared with controls and other experimental groups. Sperm count, motility, and vitality were 34.39±2.85, 28.19±3.28 and 51.86±3.36, respectively, in the nitrite treated group. The corresponding values in the walnut oil group were 72.69±3.17, 73.41±4.75, and 82.63±3.12, and the corresponding values in the nitrite + walnut oil group were 66.54±3.53, 65.69±4.06, and 68.11±2.26. However, sperm count, motility, and vitality in controls were 75.58±3.56, 70.04±4.95, 80.33±2.86. There were no significant changes in the proportions of sperm abnormalities in the experimental groups compared with controls (
