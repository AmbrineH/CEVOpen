<p class="p">Sections of the seminiferous tubules of control rats had moderately circular or oval outlines with normal stratified seminiferous epithelium showing cells of the spermatogenic series and spermatozoa within the lumen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). The rats in the walnut oil group showed normal cellular composition in their germinal epithelium with sperm cells in the lumen and a normal interstitium and prominent Leydig cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). The seminiferous tubules of the rats treated with nitrite alone showed severe reduction of cells of the spermatogenic series, hypocellularity in the interstitium, widening of the tubular lumen, tubular atrophy, and fewer spermatozoa in the tubular lumen (
