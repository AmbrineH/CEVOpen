<p class="p">The rats treated with 0.08mg/kg body weight of nitrite suffered with decreased fertility potential, as more than 90% of the female rats they mated with did not get pregnant. By their turn, the group given 0.08mg/kg body weight of nitrite and 50mg/kg body weight of walnut oil did not suffer such negative effects, since all the female rats they mated with got pregnant and had at least six fetuses. There was a decrease in the number of fetuses produced in group B treated with 50mg/kg body weight of walnut oil and 0.08mg/kg body weight of nitrite + 50mg/kg body weight of walnut oil when compared to controls. The number of pregnancies and fetuses was significantly decreased in group C rats given nitrite when compared with controls and rats in groups B and D (
