<p class="p">Nitrate is one of the most common contaminants in rural and suburban areas due to its high solubility in water; the contamination of ground water by nitrate originates primarily from fertilizers, septic systems, and manure storage or spreading operations. (

Spinach and lettuce may contain as much as 2500 mg/kg of the compound, followed by 302.0mg/kg in curly kale, 61.0mg/kg in green cauliflower, and 13mg/kg in asparagus. Nitrite levels in 34 vegetable samples including different varieties of cabbage, lettuce, spinach, parsley, and turnips ranged between 1.1 and 57mg/kg (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), can cause methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome (
