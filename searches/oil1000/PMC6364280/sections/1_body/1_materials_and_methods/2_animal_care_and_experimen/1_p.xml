<p class="p">A total of 24 male and 24 female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats of the first filial generation were randomly assigned to three treatment groups identified as B, C and D or the control group A (n=6 in each group). Orogastric tubes were used to administer the following to the animals in treatment groups B, C and D, respectively: 0.08 mg/kg body weight nitrite; 50mg/kg body weight walnut oil and 0.08mg/kg body weight of nitrite; and 50mg/kg body weight of walnut oil for 28 days. The animals in the control group (group A) were administered equal amounts of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). All the animals were housed in clean, well-ventilated cages measuring 34.0x20.5x20.0cm (temperature: 28-31°C; humidity: 50-55%) (

All experimental procedures followed the recommendations provided in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institute of Health (
