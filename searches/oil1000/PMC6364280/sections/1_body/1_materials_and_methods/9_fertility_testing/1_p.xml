 </xref>. Each male rat was isolated, placed in a cage and paired with a pro-estrous female rat in the first hours of the estrous cycle as determined by vaginal smear examination. On the following day, the female rats were checked after mating to detect spermatozoa in their vagina by microscopic examination of the vaginal fluid. Females in which sperm plugs were detected the following morning after mating were assumed to be on day one of gestation. The fetuses were removed by ventral laparotomy on the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> day of gestation and counted.
