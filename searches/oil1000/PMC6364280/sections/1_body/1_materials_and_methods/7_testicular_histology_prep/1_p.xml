<p class="p">The testes were harvested and fixed in Bouin‘s fluid for 24h and were then transferred to 70% alcohol for dehydration. The tissues were passed through 90% and absolute alcohol and xylene for different durations before they were transferred into two changes of molten paraffin wax for 1 hour each in an oven at 65◦C for infiltration. They were subsequently embedded and serial sections cut on a rotary microtome set at 5 microns. The tissues were picked up with albumenized slides and allowed to dry on hot plates for 2 min. The slides were dewaxed with xylene and passed through absolute alcohol (two changes), 70% alcohol, 50% alcohol, and then water for 5 min. The slides were then stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. The slides were mounted in DPX. Photomicrographs were taken at a magnification of 100x on a Leica DM750 microscope.</p>
