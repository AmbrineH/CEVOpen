 </xref>. The primary aim was to estimate the volumes of seminiferous tubule epithelium (seminiferous epithelium) and interstitium in the testes. This was done in accordance with 
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Howard &amp; Reed (2005)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baines 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2008)
 </xref>. Four sections per testis and six microscope fields per section were randomly chosen for analysis. Fields were sampled as images captured on a Leica DM750 bright field microscope (Germany) via LAZ software. Volume densities of testicular ingredients were determined by randomly superimposing a transparent grid comprising 35 test points arranged in a quadratic array. Test points falling on a given testis and its ingredients were summed over all fields from all sections. The total number of points hitting on a given ingredient (lumen (EL), epithelium (EE), interstitium (EI)), divided by the total number of points hitting on the testis sections (ET) multiplied by 100, provided an unbiased estimate of its percent volume density/volume fraction.
