<p class="p">Walnuts were collected from Igbara oke, Ondo State, Nigeria and were identified and authenticated in the Department of Agronomy, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria; a voucher specimen of the plant was deposited for future reference. After cleaning and drying in the shade, the air-dried walnut kernels were weighed using a CAMRY (EK5055, Indian) electronic scale and milled in an automatic electrical blender (model FS-323, China) to powdered form. Then, a portion of powdered walnut was kept in solvent n-hexane in the laboratory; after 24 hours in the solvent, the sample was strained and the solution obtained was poured into a rotary device (Rotavapor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> model ED-100) at 40-50ºC to let the solvent evaporate. To ensure the removal of moisture, the samples were kept in a vacuum desiccator (GCD-064X, KIKO, Japan) for an additional 24 hours. At the end of the process, a bright yellow oily substance with a density of 1.1485 gr/ml was obtained.
