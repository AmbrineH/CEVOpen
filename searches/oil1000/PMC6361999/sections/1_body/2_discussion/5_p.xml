<p id="Par12" class="p">The liver is the first organ to receive and metabolise fatty acids after lipid digestion and absorption. As with previously reported studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup> who found that supplementation of ewes with 3% Ca soap FA in fish oil based diets dramatically reduced 18:0 content in milk. Shingfield

 </sup> also observed that increased fish oil percentage in the diet linearly decreased 18:0 contents in the duodenum. The highest MUFA in CO (mainly 18:1n-9 contents) can be explained by the high MUFA (45.7%) input of CO into the diet. Similarly, the high LA and ALA contents (128.1 mg/100 g) in the liver of FSO fed lambs indicates that despite rumen biohydrogenation, a significant amount of ALA had escaped and was absorbed in the intestines and metabolised in the liver. Demirel

 </sup> reported that feeding linseed more than doubled the concentration of ALA in the liver compared to Megalac diet. Out of all the PUFA of plant oil origin in this study, only FSO treatment had an n-3 LC-PUFA content that was significantly higher than the control. This could be explained in part, by the high ALA content in FSO being converted to n-3 LC-PUFA. Our result was in line with the findings of Alhazzaa 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup> who reported that the gradual increase in ALA concentration led to a proportional increase in EPA in hepatocytes. The liver EPA and DHA contents of PUFA fed lambs ranged from 162.2 to 414.0 mg/100 g which was similar to EPA and DHA contents of wild Australian seafoods such as fish (containing 350 mg/150 g (~233 mg/100 g), shellfish (containing 225 mg/150 g (~150 mg/100 g) (see the review by Nichols 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>). Furthermore, the n-6/n-3 ratio in the liver is within desirable level
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, the n-3 LC-PUFA content in the liver of PUFA fed lambs can be labelled as reaching the claimable ‘good source’ based on EPA + DHA threshold of the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand guidelines

 </sup> reported that supplementation of lambs with Spirulina at the medium-level increased both n-3 and n-6 PUFA compositions. The results from our study showed that total PUFA, n-3 LC-PUFA and n-6 PUFA contents of heart were all enhanced by supplementation with various PUFA enriched pellets. Furthermore, n-3 LC-PUFA contents in the heart of supplemented lambs ranged from 70.1 to 147.5 mg/100 g; indicating that the heart could be a ‘good source’ of n-3 LC-PUFA
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. However, the n-6/n-3 ratio of the heart in all lambs with the exception of RPO, was much higher than the minimum desirable level of 4.0
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>

 </sup>. Specifically, our current findings showed that the contents of n-3 LC-PUFA ranged from 121.4 to 300.4 mg/100 g which is equal to the n-3 LC-PUFA content in Australian wild fish or shellfish (see details in the review by Nichols 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
