<p id="Par8" class="p">Past studies had used raw oil or oilseeds as supplements in ruminant feeding trials. In order to minimise oxidative rancidity, improve stability and shelf life of both feeds and meat products, we chose to use oil-infused pellets as an innovative means of delivering n-3 LC-PUFA to lambs. Besides, available information on the effect of oil-infused pellets on the fatty acid profile of lamb is scanty in the published literature. Furthermore, the use of oil-infused pellets is less bulky than raw oil or oilseeds, hence our strategy minimises transportation and storage issues in commercial lamb feed production. The fatty acid profile of lucerne hay was similar to that reported by Nguyen
