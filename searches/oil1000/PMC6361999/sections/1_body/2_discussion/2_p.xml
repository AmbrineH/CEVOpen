<p id="Par9" class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle, the higher contents of n-3 LC-PUFA in the supplemented treatments can be explained by the higher levels of by-pass lipids and protection from excessive lipolysis and extensive biohydrogenation in the rumen

 </sup>. On the other hand, it would seem that the levels and extent of biohydrogenation and conversion of stearate (18:0) into Oleate (18:1n-9) were similar, hence the observed result where no difference was found in the 18:1n-9 content of the 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle between the supplemented and control treatments. This observation could also be indicative of similar delta-nine desaturase enzyme activities among treatment groups since it is the primary enzyme responsible for the conversion of stearate to oleate in the biochemical pathway of 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> lipid synthesis. One of the biohydrogenation intermediates of ALA and LA is 18:1n-7t

 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle of lambs in the FSO treatment was 1.9 times that of the control but similar EPA and DHA contents, could be due to the low elongase enzyme activity for the elongation of C18 to ≥C20 FA and subsequent desaturation of ALA into more potent n-3 LC-PUFA, and the capacity of muscle lipids to incorporate ALA into n-3 LC-PUFA
