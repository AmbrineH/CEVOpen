<p id="Par13" class="p">Supplementation of lambs with PUFA enhanced pellets in a feedlot system is needed to boost the contents of n-3 LC-PUFA in the 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle. Lambs in CO, FSO, SO and RPO treatments had contents of EPA + DHA in 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle that were over the claimable ‘source’ level of omega-3 as stipulated by the Foods Standards of Australia and New Zealand guidelines. Supplementation of lambs with oils of plant origin including canola, rice bran, flaxseed and safflower had similar effects on the contents of n-3 LC-PUFA in lamb 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle. FSO had the highest contents of ALA in the muscle, liver and heart tissues. Liver and kidney of PUFA fed lambs can be utilised as omega-3 rich foods on the basis of their high n-3 LC-PUFA contents and desirable n-3/n-6 ratios. In line with the tested hypothesis in this study, it is proven that canola, flaxseed, safflower and rumen protected oil infused pellets can be used in feedlot systems for producing healthy lamb meat as a source of omega-3 food. The cost-efficacy of supplementing lambs with these oil-infused pellets has been presented in detail in a separate stand-alone manuscript (currently under review) and details will not be duplicated herein. Suffice it to say that the feed cost per unit gain in Australian dollars/kg (AU$/kg) for RBO and CO supplements were 3.0 AU$/kg each, 4.1, 4.2 and 6.3 AU$/kg for RPO, FO and SO supplements, respectively.
