<p id="Par15" class="p">Seventy-two White Suffolk x Corriedale first-cross prime lambs with an average liveweight (LWT) of 35.7 ± 0.9 kg weaned at 6 months were randomly allocated into six treatments: (1) Control: lucerne hay only; wheat-based pellet infused with 50 ml/kg dry matter (DM) of oil from (2) rice bran (RBO); (3) canola (CO); (4) rumen-protected (RPO), (5) flaxseed (FSO) and (6) safflower (SO) sources in a completely randomized design balanced by equal number of ewe and wether lambs. The animals were kept in individual pens and had 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> access to clean fresh water and lucerne hay throughout the duration of the feeding trial. The lambs were sheltered in a roofed experimental shed with adequate ventilation and individual lamb pen dimension was 6 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (1.2 m in width and 5 m in length). The average minimum and maximum temperatures during the experimental period were 6.5 °C and 19.7 °C in April and 3.4 °C and 12.6 °C in June, respectively. Average rainfall figures during the experimental period were 21.4 mm and 147 mm in April and June, respectively. Each lamb in the supplemented treatments was fed 1 kg pellets/day. The feeding trial lasted 10 weeks including a 3-week adaptation period and followed by 7 weeks of full supplementation. Freshly offered feed was given every day at 9.00 h after residual feed had been collected and weighed. The level of refusal of the concentrate supplement ranged from 0.14–0.18 kg DM/head/day. The chemical composition of the experimental and basal diets is presented in Table
