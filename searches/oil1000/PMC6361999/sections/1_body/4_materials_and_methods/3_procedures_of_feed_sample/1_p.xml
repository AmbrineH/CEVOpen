 </sup> for DM and ash. Neutral Detergent (NDF) and Acid Detergent (ADF) fibre contents were determined using an Ankom Fibre Analyzer (ANKOM2000; ANKOM Technology, USA). Nitrogen content was quantified using a Thermo Finnigan EA 1112 Series Flash Elemental Analyzer and the values multiplied by 6.25 to give the estimated crude protein (CP) percentage. Ether extract (EE) was analysed using an ANKOM
