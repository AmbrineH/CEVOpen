<p id="Par18" class="p">FA analyses of meat, organs and feed samples were conducted at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Food Nutrition &amp; Bio-based Products, Oceans &amp; Atmosphere Laboratory in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The procedure of FA analysis was described in detail previously by Malau-Aduli,

 </sup>. The first step of the process was a single-phase overnight extraction using CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (1:2:0.8 v/v). The second step involved phase separation with the addition of CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>:saline Milli-Q H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (1:1 v/v) and followed by rotary evaporation of the lower chloroform phase at 40 °C to obtain total lipids. An aliquot from each total lipid extract was used in transmethylation process with MeOH:CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>:HCl (10:1:1 v/v) for 2 h at 80 °C and then fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were extracted three times using hexane:CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (4:1 v/v). A known concentration of an internal standard (19:0) was added in 1500 µL vial containing the extracted FAME. The FAME was analysed on a 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with an Equity
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup>-1 fused 15 m silica capillary column with 0.1 mm internal diameter and 0.1-μm film thickness (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA), a flame ionisation detector, a split/splitless injector and an Agilent Technologies 7683 B Series autosampler. The gas chromatograph conditions were: splitless mode injection; carrier gas He; initial oven temperature 120 °C and then increased to 270 °C at 10 °C/min and to 310 °C at 5 °C/min. The Agilent Technologies ChemStation software (Palo Alto, California USA) was used to quantify fatty acid peaks. The fatty acid identities were confirmed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis using a Finnigan Thermoquest GCQ GC/MS fitted with an on-column injector and Thermoquest Xcalibur software (Austin, Texas USA). The gas chromatograph (GC) was equipped with an HP-5 cross-linked methyl silicone-fused silica capillary column (50 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter) which was of similar polarity to the column described above. The carrier gas was helium and GC conditions were according to the description of Miller,

 </sup>. FA percentages were computed as follows: FA% = (individual fatty acid area) ∗ (100)/(sum total area of fatty acids). FA contents were calculated as follows: FA mg/100 g = (Total lipid) ∗ (LCF [0.916]) ∗ ([%FA]/100) ∗ 1000
