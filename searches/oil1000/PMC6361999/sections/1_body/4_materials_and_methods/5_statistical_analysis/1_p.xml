<p id="Par19" class="p">Fatty acid data were initially transformed into fatty acid contents (mg/ 100 g). These data were then analysed using the General Linear Model procedure (PROC GLM) of Statistical Analysis System

 </sup>. The fixed effects of treatment and gender and their second order interaction effects on fatty acid contents were tested. The initial full statistical model used for the analysis was: Y = μ + O
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> + G
 <sub class="sub">j</sub> + (OG)
 <sub class="sub">ij</sub> + (OG)
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>
 <sub class="sub">ij</sub> + (OG)
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>
 <sub class="sub">ij</sub> + e
 <sub class="sub">ijk</sub> where Y = dependent variable, μ = overall mean, O
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> = oil supplementation treatment, G
 <sub class="sub">j</sub> = gender, brackets and superscripts represent linear and cubic second-order interactions and e
 <sub class="sub">ijk</sub> = residual error. Linear and cubic orthogonal contrasts indicated that gender was not a significant factor, hence it was removed from the final model that assessed the impact of treatment only. Duncan’s multiple range tests were used to determine the differences amongst treatments at a minimum threshold of p &lt; 0.05 level.
