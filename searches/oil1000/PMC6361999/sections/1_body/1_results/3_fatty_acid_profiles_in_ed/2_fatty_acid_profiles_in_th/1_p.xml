 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> depicts fatty acid contents (mg/100 g) of the heart. There was no difference in total FA, SFA and MUFA; similar to the same trend observed in the 
 <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle. PUFA and 18:1n-7t in all supplemented treatments were significantly higher than in the control treatment. The control had the lowest contents of n-6 PUFA and LA. The RPO treatment had the highest n-3 LC-PUFA and n-3 PUFA, whilst the lowest contents of these FA were in the control treatment. FSO had the highest ALA content (51.3 mg/100 g). SO and rice bran infused pellets (RBO) treatments had the highest n-6/n-3 ratio and RPO had the lowest. Generally, the n-6/n-3 ration in all treatments ranged from 2.7 to 6.6.
