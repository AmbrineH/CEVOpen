The means of all fatty acid components in the liver were markedly higher than those in the muscle and significant differences were evident in both saturated and unsaturated FA. The CO treatment had the highest total FA (3775.0 mg/100 g) and MUFA (1018.0 mg/100 g) contents. The lowest SFA and 18:0 contents were found in the RPO group (1086.0 mg/100 g and 595.5 mg/100 g, respectively). Contents of n-6 PUFA and LA in all supplemented treatments, except for RPO, were significantly higher than in the control. RPO had the highest n-3 PUFA and n-3 LC-PUFA which mainly consisted of EPA, DPA and DHA. The ratio of n-6/n-3 in all treatments ranged from 0.6 to 1.9. The highest value of ALA was found in the FSO treatment (128.1 mg/100 g).
