All supplemented treatments had significantly higher PUFA and LA contents than the control. RPO treatment had the highest n-3 LC-PUFA and n-3 PUFA contents. The highest total FA, n-6 PUFA and LA contents were in the SO treatment (2305.0; 752.6 and 375.8 mg/100 g, respectively). The observed trend of n-3 LC-PUFA content was similar to the pattern observed in the liver where only FSO treatment had greater n-3 LC-PUFA content than the control. The range in n-6/n-3 ratio in all treatments was from 1.3 to 4.0 in which the SO treatment had the highest ratio.
