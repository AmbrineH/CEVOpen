 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. There was no difference among treatments in total fatty acids (FA), saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). The PUFA, n-3 LC-PUFA, n-3 PUFA and 18:1n-7t of supplemented treatments were significantly higher than that of control. The RPO treatment had the highest contents of n-3 LC-PUFA (66 mg/100 g); mainly EPA, DPA and DHA. The highest mean of ALA was found in the FSO treatment (45.6 mg/100 g) and the lowest value was in the control. All supplemented treatments, except for RPO, had significantly higher values of LA than that of control. The SO treatment contained the highest contents of n-6 PUFA and n-6/n-3 ratios of all treatments varied from 1.8 to 3.5.
