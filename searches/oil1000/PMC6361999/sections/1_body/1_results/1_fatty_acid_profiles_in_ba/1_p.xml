<p id="Par3" class="p">Fatty acid composition (as % total fatty acids) of both basal and supplementary feeds are presented in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Lucerne hay contained high proportions of PUFA and n-3 PUFA (48.7 and 28.2%, respectively). The major fatty acids in lucerne hay were 18:2n-6 (LA) and 18:3n-3 (ALA), with relatively high levels of 19.0 and 27.5%, respectively. Similarly, flaxseed oil infused pellets (FSO) contained relatively high levels of PUFA and n-3 PUFA (62.2 and 20.7%, respectively) and the major fatty acids in FSO were LA (41.0%), ALA (20.5%) and 18:1n-9 (18.8%). The remaining treatments were rich in PUFA and n-6 PUFA with relatively high levels ranging from 39 to 59 (%) and 34 to 57(%), respectively, in which the major fatty acids were LA and 18:1n-9. The highest n-6 PUFA level was found in safflower oil infused pellets (SO) (mainly LA: 56.5%). The rumen protected oil infused pellets (RPO) had the highest proportions of n-3 LC-PUFA comprising 4.8% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3).
