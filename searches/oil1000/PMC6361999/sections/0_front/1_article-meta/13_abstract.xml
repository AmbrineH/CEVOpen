 <p id="Par1" class="p">We investigated the effect of various dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) sources on the fatty acid profiles of muscle, liver, heart and kidney of Australian prime lambs. Seventy-two White Suffolk x Corriedale first-cross lambs weaned at 6 months of age were randomly allocated to the following six treatments: (1) Control: Lucerne hay only; wheat-based pellets infused with 50 ml/kg dry matter (DM) of oil from (2) rice bran (RBO); (3) canola (CO); (4) rumen-protected (RPO), (5) flaxseed (FSO) and (6) safflower (SO) sources in a completely randomized experimental design. Lambs in CO, FSO, SO and RPO treatments achieved contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 22:5n-3) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in the 
  <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle ranging from 31.1 to 57.1 mg/135 g, over and above the 30 mg per standard serve (135 g) threshold for “source” claim under the Australian guidelines. There was no difference in n-3 LC-PUFA contents in 
  <italic class="italic">longissimus dorsi</italic> muscle of lambs fed dietary oils of plant origin. The highest 18:3n-3 (ALA) contents achieved with FSO diet in the muscle, liver and heart were 45.6, 128.1 and 51.3 mg/100 g, respectively. Liver and kidney contained high contents of n-3 LC-PUFA (ranging from 306.7 to 598.2 mg/100 g and 134.0 to 300.4 mg/100 g, respectively), with all values readily exceeding the ‘good source’ status (60 mg per serve under Australian guidelines). The liver and kidney of PUFA fed lambs can be labelled as ‘good source’ of n-3 LC-PUFA based on EPA and DHA contents stipulated by the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand guidelines. Therefore, if lamb consumers consider eating the liver and kidney as their dietary protein sources, they can adequately obtain the associated health benefits of n-3 LC-PUFA.
