After cooling the samples, 2.5 ml phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) was added to each tube. UV-Visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance at 660 nm. The control represents 100% protein denaturation. For test control solution (0.5 ml) 0.05 ml distilled water was used instead of oil sample while for product control (0.5 ml) 0.45 ml distilled water and test solution (0.05 ml) were used. The percentage inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated by the following formula:
