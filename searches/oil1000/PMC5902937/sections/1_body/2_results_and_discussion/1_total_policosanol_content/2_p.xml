<p id="Par36" class="p">The content of policosanol in milk thistle oil was affected by seed maturity stages (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). It was higher in the immature seeds (987.68 mg/kg oil) and then decreased during seed maturation. Also, a decreasing trend was observed for the policosanol content during the early stages of corn kernel development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. In contrast, during 
 <italic class="italic">Tilia tomentosa</italic> leaf development, total primary alcohol content was found to increase from 0.031% to 0.197% of dry weight [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. These quantitative differences observed in the policosanol content during seed development could be linked to change in the activity of fatty acyl-coA reductase which converts fatty acyl-coA into fatty alcohol.
