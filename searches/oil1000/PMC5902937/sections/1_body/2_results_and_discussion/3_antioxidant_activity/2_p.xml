<p id="Par40" class="p">Our results showed that the antiradical action of oil samples was affected by the seed maturity stage (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The immature seed oil that contained the highest policosanol amount showed the maximum antiradical activity (96.42% and 90.35% for DPPH test and ABTS assay, respectively). A decline in the antioxidant activity was also observed for carob, pepper and guava throughout fruit ripening [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. The stronger antioxidant capacity of immature seed oil compared to mature seed oil may be due to the differences in their content and composition of unsaponifiable matter. In our previous study, we found that the amount of total unsaponifiable matter decreased during milk thistle seed maturation, while the total lipid content increased [
