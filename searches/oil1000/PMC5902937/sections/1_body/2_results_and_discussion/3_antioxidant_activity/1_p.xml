<p id="Par39" class="p">The antioxidant activity of the milk thistle oil samples was evaluated using the two most common radical scavenging assays DPPH and ABTS. The DPPH test has been widely used for the estimation of the antioxidant capacity of plant and health food extracts due to its simplicity, stability and reproducibility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. All the tested oil samples showed strong radical scavenging activity which varied from 70.25 to 96.42% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The difference between DPPH and ABTS values obtained for the same sample might be due to the fact that ABTS assay is applicable to both hydropholic and lipopholic antioxidants systems, however DDPH assay is applicable to hydrophobic system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. Milk thistle seed oil had a higher DPPH value compared with other vegetables oils such as unheated sesame oil which had DPPH value of 69.2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. This result is in agreement with previous studies that showed a high free radical scavenging capacity for cold-pressed milk thistle oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] and ethanolic extracts of milk thistle seeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Kiralan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] reported that olive oil was able to quench 52.31–94.91% of DPPH radicals, depending in olive cultivar. Using toluene to dissolve the DPPH and the oil samples, the order of effectiveness of some vegetable oils in inhibiting free radicals was as follows: coriander &gt;black cumin&gt; cottonseed&gt; peanut&gt; sunflower&gt; walnut&gt; hemp seed&gt; linseed &gt;olive &gt;niger seed [
