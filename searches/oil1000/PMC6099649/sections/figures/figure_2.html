 <p> Scheme of the structure of α-syn. ( a) The three major domains of the protein are indicated: the N-terminal region involved in lipid and membrane binding (1–60), the NAC domain (61–95) responsible for aggregation properties of the protein and the acidic C-terminal region, able to transiently interact with the N-terminal and the NAC domains, modulating the aggregation propensity of the protein (96–140). The 11-amino acid imperfect repeats are indicated by grey lines. The highly conserved amino acid motifs are colored in orange. The 12 residues (71–82) essential for amyloid aggregation are also highlighted. The main pathological missense mutations are located in the N-terminal region. The post-translational modifications are indicated by symbols: blue square, oxidation; red inverse triangle, phosphorylation; orange stars, nitration; ( b) In the presence of vesicles, micelles and oil droplets, the N-terminal domain of α-syn acquires an α-helical secondary structure. The unbound protein is unfolded (curved lines); ( c) Schematic mechanism of amyloid aggregation of α-syn. The process is presumably a step-wise formation of larger multimeric protein species, starting from the monomeric unfolded protein. </p>
