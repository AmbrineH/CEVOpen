 <p> Conformational transition and aggregation of α-syn in the presence of DHA. The DHA self-assembly process as a function of the critical aggregative concentration (CAC) in the presence of the protein is shown. DHA m and DHA od represent the fatty acid monomer and the oil droplet containing DHA, respectively; U, the unfolded free protein; I m, the protein in the presence of non-saturating concentration of DHA; F od, the protein in the presence of oil droplets; I od, the species in equilibrium with the lipid-bound protein. The early and subsequent proteolytic events by proteinase K (PK) are shown. In the absence of DHA, α-syn, unfolded in solution (U), undergoes structural transition and forms amyloid-like fibrils. In the presence of DHA (P/DHA ≥ 10), free α-syn molecules are in equilibrium with the bound ones. Under this condition, transient intermediates form (I m), and these species evolve in amyloid-like fibrils, as free α-syn molecules are available. The aggregation occurs in a shorter time than in the absence of the fatty acid. In the presence of DHA (P/DHA ≥ 50), all α-syn molecules are bound to the fatty acid (F od), acquiring an α-helical conformation, and the formation of stable oligomers occurs. </p>
