<p class="p">Our data suggested that the physiological and pathological effects of α-syn are determined by distinct regions of the primary structure. For its role as a scavenger of oxygen radicals, lysine, methionine and histidine residues are involved, as well as the structural interaction with PUFAs is an essential requisite [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In fact, we have interpreted the covalent modifications occurring on α-syn after DHA exposure as a protective response to PUFAs’ peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], according to the recent hypothesis that α-syn may act as scavenger of ROS in healthy cells [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. The presence of α-syn in synaptic terminals and its ability to bind to plasma membranes, lipid rafts, inner nuclear membrane and mitochondrial membrane are correlated with the physiological function of the protein [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. In a simplified scheme, α-syn might interact with free PUFAs, released from neuronal membranes, before their turn-over processes would be activated. Indeed, in human brain, DHA and AA, as repeatedly underlined, are the main fatty acids in membrane phospholipids [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>], which are essential for the maintenance of the fluidity and permeability of neuronal membranes. PUFAs and their mediators regulate several processes within the brain, such as neurotransmission, cell survival and neuroinflammation, and thereby mood and cognition [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. They are released from membrane phospholipids in the cytosol by PLA-2. Then, PUFAs follow their natural destiny of recycling or degradation [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Changes in the activity of PLA-2 enzymes, altered PUFA metabolism and/or associated phenomena could induce an increase of the DHA level, with a series of consequences, which ultimately lead to neuronal damage [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. However, it seems that DHA levels depend on the age, diet, gender and genotype of genes involved in the endogenous synthesis of DHA and are in relation to the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative disorders [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>,
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. It was also observed that levels of DHA in the non-esterified form are elevated in patients affected by PD or LB dementia [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, the question is still debated, since it has also been reported that deficits in DHA are associated with cognitive decline during aging and in neurodegenerative disease [
