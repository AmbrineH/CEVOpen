<p class="p">On the other hand, it could be possible that under certain pathogenic conditions mediated by either increasing oxidative stress (aging, PD) and changing DHA/AA concentration, α-syn/PUFA interaction may have negative prerogatives, and the same protein-lipid interaction causes α-syn to form toxic oligomers upon incubation. The formation of stable toxic oligomers is observed when α-syn is incubated in the presence of a high concentration of DHA and AA [

It could be possible that lipid oxidative species increase to an extent that does not allow the normal biological turnover of α-syn, leading to the accumulation of modified protein and increasing the propensity of its oligomerization. Since oligomers seem to be the toxic species rather than fibrils, we believe that the increasing DHA concentration in the cell could worsen toxicity rather than having a protective role.
