<p class="p">Despite the progresses made in the knowledge of the structure and function of α-syn, its role in the onset of PD and more in general in neurodegeneration is far from being understood. The interplay between α-syn and PUFAs could provide a key link, since the ability of monomeric α-syn to interact with free and aggregated PUFAs has different consequences both in physiological and pathological conditions.</p>
