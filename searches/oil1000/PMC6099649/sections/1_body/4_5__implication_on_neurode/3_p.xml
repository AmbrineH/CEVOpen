<p class="p">In this picture, we considered the protein/DHA ratio as a discriminant factor between the biological function and the pathological consequences. As seen so far, on the one hand, α-syn might have a protective role due to its scavenging activity on lipid oxidation [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This occurs in physiological conditions, in which the normal amount of oxidized DHA can be scavenged by α-syn, together with other concurring protective cellular mechanisms. An increase in the PUFA/α-syn ratio could lead to an increase in α-syn aggregation as a result of enhanced α-syn binding to PUFA oil droplets, but increased binding could also interfere with the formation of β-sheet-rich oligomers of α-syn by favoring α-helix formation and by diluting α-syn molecules on the oil droplet surface.
