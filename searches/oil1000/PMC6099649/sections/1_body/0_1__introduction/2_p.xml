<p class="p">Despite the intense investigations on the structure and putative function of α-syn, the detailed relationship between the protein and the onset of PD is not clarified yet [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The ability of α-syn to interact with membranes and more in general with lipids has made this topic the target of numerous studies. The key event in neurons that leads to PD and neurodegeneration is not defined, and several pathways that underlie both genetic and sporadic forms of the disorder are possible. Fatty acids, especially brain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their relationship with α-syn, are stimulating considerable attention. PUFAs serve as an energy reservoir, contribute to signaling pathways and regulate many processes in the brain such as neurotransmission, cell survival, mood and cognition. However, in conditions of oxidative stress, as well as in patients affected by PD, the neuronal levels of PUFAs in a non-esterified form were found higher than normal [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and, anyway, altered in various neurological disorder [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In particular, the levels of those PUFA-derived substances, representing the markers of oxidized lipids, were found to be ten-fold higher than normal in the
