<p class="p">In this review, the molecular features of the interaction between α-syn and brain PUFAs, especially arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are discussed in the context of PD. We and other hypothesize that the protein/PUFA molecular ratio in neurons is a discriminant factor, and increases in the levels of either certain PUFAs or α-syn monomers in the cytoplasm can produce different effects in physiological and pathological conditions [

Under physiological conditions, α-syn can actively participate in the control of oxidative homeostasis of the intracellular environment, protecting the free fatty acids from oxidation and maintaining their correct level. Environmental factors can affect this equilibrium, by either increasing oxidative stress or changing DHA concentration. Since protein oligomerization has been observed upon exposure to PUFAs and because oligomers might represent the most toxic species, the increased DHA concentration in the cell could exacerbate toxicity rather than having a protective role [
