<p class="p">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by severe motor symptoms, such as tremor, difficulty in movements and rigidity. PD has a multifactorial etiology and constitutes the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of dopamine-producer neurons in the 
 <italic class="italic">substantia nigra</italic> are some of the most common disease hallmarks. The pathological distinctive elements of PD are represented by the Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neuritis (LN), ubiquinated protein inclusions mainly composed of the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) [

Both in familial and in sporadic PD, the protein is present as an insoluble filamentous aggregate, known as a fibril, with specific morphology and structure, and α-syn dysfunction appears a critical determinant for the development of the disease [
