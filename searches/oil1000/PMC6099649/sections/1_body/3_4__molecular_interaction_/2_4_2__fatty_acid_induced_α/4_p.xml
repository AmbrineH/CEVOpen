<p class="p">In vitro studies have shown to be very useful to rationalize the effects of PUFA on α-syn oligomerization. Both the structure of fatty acids and the PUFA/protein ratio affect the kinetics and the type of aggregation, as well as the morphology of the grown aggregates. Indeed, PUFAs, but not saturated FA, can induce the oligomerization and aggregation of α-syn [

 <xref rid="B132-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>], suggesting that this phenomenon is correlated with the specific property of PUFA to form micelles, vesicles or other aggregated species as a function of their concentration. Moreover, it was shown that in the presence of an excess of lipid in which all protein molecules are bound to the fatty acid, the protein undergoes oligomerization [

 <xref rid="B124-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. At low PUFA/protein ratios, when free monomer is present in solution, the bound ones serve as starting nuclei for further aggregation, leading to fibril formation [

 <xref rid="B122-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. The rate of the nucleation reaction is at least three orders of magnitude greater than that occurring in bulk solution, due to the high local concentration of protein molecules at the surface of the vesicle/micelle/droplet and to their likely ability to explore conformations that may favor primary nucleation [
