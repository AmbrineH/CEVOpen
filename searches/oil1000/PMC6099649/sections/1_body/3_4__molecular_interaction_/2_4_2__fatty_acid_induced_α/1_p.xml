 <xref rid="B100-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>] have shown that also the PD-associated variants A30P and A53T of α-syn oligomerize in vitro upon exposure to vesicles containing PUFA at physiological concentrations of protein and phospholipids. The protein aggregation is a subsequent event, but strictly correlated with PUFA binding. A mutant deleted of the N-terminus, essential for binding, is not able to oligomerize, when transfected in HEK293 cells [
