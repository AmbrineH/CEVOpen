<p class="p">Recently, Iljina et al. [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>] have proposed that AA-induced α-syn oligomers could potentially form in vivo, and this could represent a species in which the protein has acquired an α-helical structure, in equilibrium with the unfolded monomer protein, prone to aggregation. The potential function of this AA-protein complex could be protective, leading to the stabilization of the protein in a structured form resistant to further aggregation. In the context of PD, this may contribute to the reduction in cytotoxicity associated with PUFAs [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>]. In conclusion, the accumulation of α-syn, including as soluble oligomers, is associated with alterations in brain PUFA composition. Specifically, such protein accumulation occurs especially in those fractions of brains with PD and DLB, where also certain long-chain PUFAs (especially DHA) are found at more than normal levels. This raises the possibility that brain PUFA content could be therapeutically downregulated, reducing the natural tendency of oligomerization of α-syn, losing its deleterious effects [
