<p class="p">The effects of PUFAs on α-syn aggregation in vivo are quite complex, but in the majority of studies, a strong correlation between α-syn oligomers’ appearance and increase in PUFA levels in the brain was found. In particular, PUFA levels have been found elevated in PD and LB disease (DLB) brain-soluble fractions and in neuronal cells overexpressing α-syn or its pathological mutants. An increased PUFA content induces an increase in membrane fluidity in neurons overexpressing α-syn, while in α-syn, genetically deleted mice, both PUFA content and membrane fluidity seem to be decreased. On the basis of these observations, Sharon et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] concluded that α-syn and PUFAs’ interaction could physiologically contribute to regulating the neuronal PUFA levels. Moreover, exposure of neuronal cell lines to PUFAs increases the levels of α-syn oligomers, suggesting that PUFAs in vivo could promote the formation of α-syn-soluble oligomers as precursors of the insoluble aggregates associated with neurodegeneration [

In oligodendroglia (OLN) cell lines, overexpressing the α-syn A53T mutant, the formation of α-syn aggregates resembling the inclusion observed in neurodegeneration upon exposure to DHA was observed, which was incorporated into cell membranes, as well as oxidative stress [
