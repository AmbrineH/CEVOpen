<p class="p">Around 5–10% of PD cases are linked to genetic mutations [
 <xref rid="B135-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">135</xref>], among which at least four known missense mutations are on the SNCA gene coding for α-syn [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>]. The most common variants are A30P, E46K, H50Q and A53T [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and interestingly, the mutations fall in the region, which plays a role in the interaction with lipids [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. α-Syn seems to interact with phospholipids through two different binding mode, called SL1 and SL2 [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. These states differ for the length of the interacting sequence, involving residues 3–25 for SL1 and up to residue 100 for SL2 state. All the studied variants populate the SL1 state, which anchors the protein to the lipid while causing the hydrophobic NAC region to remain unfolded and thus more prone to aggregation. These differences may be linked to specific variations of the amino acid properties, as for example the presence of a proline for A30P that may disrupt the secondary structure. From a pathological point of view, the loss of α-syn-lipid interaction impairs α-syn scavenger function, while on the other side, it favors the protein oligomerization [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Data about how these variants interact with PUFAs are lacking. We observed a similar aggregation propensity of variants A30P, E46K and A53T upon interaction with DHA, acquiring an α-helix in a lipid dose-dependent manner and forming stable oligomers as those observed for the wild-type protein with a protein-lipid ratio of 1:50 [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. However, considering the demonstrated protein-PUFAs interplay and the suggested scavenger role of α-syn, it would be interesting to deepen these aspects in the presence of natural gene mutations, since structure-determined differences similar to those observed for phospholipids are likely to emerge.
