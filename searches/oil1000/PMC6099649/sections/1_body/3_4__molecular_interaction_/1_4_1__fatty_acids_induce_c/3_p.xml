<p class="p">Interestingly, the association of α-syn with MUFAs and PUFAs in the form of vesicles, micelles or oil droplets affects their stability and integrity, leading to a destabilization of these self-aggregation products (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01531-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b,c). Generally, a variation in both PUFA aggregates’ size and surface properties has been observed, generating species with a smaller diameter and lowering the FA concentration necessary to form aggregates [

 <xref rid="B117-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. This phenomenon is correlated with the availability of the protein since, when all the protein molecules are bound to the FA, the free FA molecules are not prevented from forming aggregates of various sizes, corroborating the opinion that the protein/PUFAs’ interaction is a mutual and dynamic process. This ability to disperse PUFA aggregates leads one to speculate a putative protective function of α-syn in the cellular environment [
