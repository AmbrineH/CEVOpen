<p class="p">In conclusion, the molecular interaction between α-syn and PUFA seems to be mediated by two biophysical criteria, of electrostatic and hydrophobic nature. The positively-charged N-terminal domain of α-syn, which is essential for the cooperative formation of helical domains in the protein, is able to recognize the net negative lipid surface charge of PUFA [
