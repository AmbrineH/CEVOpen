<p class="p">The molecular ratio between α-syn and PUFA (P/PUFA) seems to play a key role in their dynamic interplay, affecting the equilibrium between the bound and free forms of the protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01531-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Employing a non-saturating DHA concentration (i.e., P/DHA molar ratio of 1:10), about 65% of the free protein molecules are in equilibrium with the bound fraction. Circular dichroism studies show that, under these conditions, the protein adopts a partly-folded state, substantially α-helical. At a P/DHA molar ratio of 1:50, almost all protein molecules are bound to DHA; the fraction of free molecules is negligible; and the protein conformation is completely converted into an α-helical structure [

 <xref rid="B124-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>] have shown that a high lipid: α-syn ratio implies that essentially all the protein molecules are bound to the vesicle surface and are in helical conformation. The presence of free protein molecules in equilibrium with the aggregated FA can have variable consequences on protein aggregation and oligomerization, as discussed below.
