<p class="p">The topic about the α-syn secondary structure in vivo is still debated. α-Syn, expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, was found to be monomeric and natively unfolded [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], but it can acquire an α-helical structure upon interaction with membranes and lipids [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], or β-sheet conformation, when it is embedded in amyloid fibrils [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, α-syn was reported to be in equilibrium between membrane-bound and unbound states (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01531-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b). The binding of α-syn to membranes is related to their chemical properties and preferentially occurs with membranes rich in acidic lipids [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>], with highly curved and with small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Moreover, α-syn binds membranes mainly composed of long PUFA tails and inositol as the head group [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. Upon lipid binding, α-syn can adopt different types of α-helical structure, as seen by using different biophysical techniques. Ulmer et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>] found that, as a result of SDS-micelle binding, α-syn can form two anti-parallel curved α-helices (Val3-Val37 and Lys45-Thr92) connected by a well-ordered linker, whereas the ending C-terminal tail remains highly mobile. By using a site-directed spin labeling and electronic paramagnetic resonance EPR-based approach, it was demonstrated that in the presence of lipid bilayers, the first 90 amino acids of α-syn adopt an extended curved α-helix, with a periodicity of 11/3, parallel to the membrane, where lysine and glutamic residues interact with the zwitterionic headgroups, while the uncharged residues interact with the hydrophobic region [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. Other studies report the formation of a unique helical structure upon α-syn binding to SUVs, rod-like SDS micelles and lipid bicelles [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. Ferreon et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>] showed a model of interaction of α-syn with SUVs and SDS micelles in which an interplay exists between a broken and an extended α-helix. However, the structure of α-syn unbound states is still not clarified. Recently, endogenous α-syn was isolated from neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines by non-denaturing techniques, and it was shown that the protein was physiologically present in a tetrameric form rich in α-helical structure [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. This was previously observed also for α-syn expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. This tetramer was shown to have low propensity to aggregate into amyloid fibrils. In contrast, other studies confirm the natively unfolded nature of α-syn [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. Nonetheless, an ensemble of conformers of α-syn has been shown to exist in vivo [
