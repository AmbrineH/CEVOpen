 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01531-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a), the amino-terminal (1–60), the central region (61–95) and the carboxy-terminal (96–140). The amphipathic lysine-rich amino terminus, containing four of the seven 11-amino acid imperfect sequence repeats, with a highly conserved hexameric motif (KTKEGV), has a crucial role in modulating the interaction with membranes and lipids and resembles the amphipathic helices present in apolipoproteins [

The carboxyl-terminal region (residues 96–140) is enriched in acidic and proline residues, and it is suggested to play an important role in modulating the aggregation properties of the protein, its localization and interaction with metals, small molecules and proteins [
