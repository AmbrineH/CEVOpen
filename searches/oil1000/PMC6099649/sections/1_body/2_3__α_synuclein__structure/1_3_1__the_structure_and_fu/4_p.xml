<p class="p">The association of α-syn to membrane and lipid has been widely studied, since several pieces of evidence correlate the protein’s physiological function, still poorly understood, with lipids. Indeed, α-syn seems to be implicated in processes correlated with synaptic vesicle homeostasis, contributing to synaptic vesicles formation, fusion, regulation, plasticity and recycling [

 <xref rid="B87-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Other evidence links α-syn to the modulation of dopamine biosynthesis and dopamine release from pre-synaptic vesicles [

 <xref rid="B89-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. A role for α-syn was proposed in the assembly and disassembly of the SNARE complex, reporting that α-syn seems to act as a chaperone, necessary for vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmission [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Furthermore, as specified above, the interaction between α-syn and cell membrane phospholipids and its sequence similarity with apolipoprotein have led to the hypothesis of a role for the protein as a lipid transporter. In fact, α-syn does not simply interact with membranes, but is able to remodel them [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Further, it was shown that α-syn and PUFAs’ interaction affects endocytosis and vesicle recycling in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and specifically activates synaptic vesicle recycling after neuronal stimulation by enhancing clathrin-mediated endocytosis [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. A role for α-syn in brain lipid metabolism has also been suggested, since fatty acid uptake and metabolism appear affected in the absence of the protein [

In particular, these authors have shown that the deletion of the SNCA gene induces the opposite effects on DHA and AA brain metabolism and suggested that the increase in incorporation and turnover of DHA in specific brain phospholipids is the result of metabolic compensation for the reduced incorporation and turnover of AA [
