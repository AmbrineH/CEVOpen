<p class="p">Beyond the genetic mutations, α-syn is subjected to posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that are mainly implicated in prompting or decreasing the rate of fibril formation and in modulating membrane interaction [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Some of these modifications are represented by phosphorylation, occurring mostly at serine 87 and 129 and tyrosine 125, 133 and 135 residues [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], acetylation at the N-terminal [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], oxidation of the methionine (Met) residues and nitration at the tyrosine, especially the 39 and 125 residues [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. SUMOylation, glycation, glycosylation and proteolysis were also reported for α-syn, even if the position or the biological and physiological implications are not well clarified yet [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Of interest, Met oxidations (especially Met1 and Met5) seem to play an important role in modulating α-syn membrane binding [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Moreover, in vivo, these Met can be reduced by methionine sulfoxide reductase. Exploiting this physiological reversibility, α-syn can contribute to the protection of membranes from oxidative damage [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Further, α-syn containing oxidized Met forms stable oligomers and inhibits α-syn fibrillation [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. By using a combined approach of proteolysis and mass spectrometry, we showed that in the presence of PUFAs (AA and DHA), α-syn can be chemically modified. In particular, the early radical products of DHA and AA autoxidation can react with α-syn, producing a covalent modification on the protein. The histidine at position 50 seems to be the major target of this reaction. These data suggested a possible physiological role for the protein, that is a sequestering ability to capture free radicals. On this basis, we proposed that the protein may play a neuroprotective role in neurons in response to oxidative stress, eventually preventing oxidation of PUFAs [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Consistently, Zhu et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] have previously found that α-syn can prevent lipid oxidation also when bound to membranes.
