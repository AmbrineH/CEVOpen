<p class="p">The correlation of PUFA composition with brain health is suggested by the fact that it is altered in an age-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]: specifically, a decrease in n-6 PUFAs has been reported, while n-3 PUFAs tend to increase [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. During aging, intensified lipid clearance and catabolism are required, due to neuron death and decrease in brain volume [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Above all, the main factor with aging resides in the increase of lipid peroxidation, promoting neurodegenerative diseases such as AD or PD [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The brain is the main oxygen consumer organ in the body, accounting for around 23% of the total in adulthood [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Moreover, the brain has a high-energy demand to ensure neuronal transmission, transport and protein synthesis, and it mainly relies on glycolysis [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. These facts make the brain vulnerable to oxidative damage, considering the elevated presence of easily-oxidizable PUFAs and strong need for glucose metabolism. Notably, all PUFAs are subject to attack by oxygen because of the presence of double bonds, but DHA is especially at risk due to its five bis-allylic sites that make it highly prone to oxidation [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Due to the high concentration of DHA in the brain, high metabolic rates and high levels of reactive oxygen species, efficient antioxidant mechanisms are mandatory, and indeed a considerable amount of energy within the brain is devoted to this goal [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], with different systems developed to protect DHA from oxidation and to scavenge and replace damaged DHA [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Recycling of FAs within membrane phospholipids is probably the most efficient mechanism to remove damaged lipids, with PLA-2 and ACSL enzymes able, in rodents, to recycle each day up to 100% of membranes. This great effort requires a highly-dedicated energy expenditure, which has been calculated to be around 5% of ATP consumption in the brain [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. This precarious equilibrium has been reported to be altered in aging [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], when the normal protective systems may fail to counteract the oxidative damage, as well as in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, where it may represent a major triggering factor [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In a recent work, we suggested that also Î±-syn may have a role in protecting neurons from oxidized DHA products, as will be discussed below [
