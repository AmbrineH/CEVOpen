<p class="p">Very long FAs are synthesized in liver and reach brain through circulation [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Different mechanisms have been reported to describe FAs crossing of the brain blood barrier, including FA/albumin complexes, circulating lipoproteins or diffusion without dedicated transporters [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. FAs can then pass the plasma membrane by a flip-flop mechanism, whereas their diffusion outside the cells is prevented by acyl-CoA derivatization. Acyl-CoA synthetases are the first enzymes, among several, which are implicated in FAs metabolism and regulation [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Long-chain-fatty-acyl-CoA synthases (ACSLs) specifically activate DHA and AA, of which the majority will then be esterified to phospholipids immediately upon lipids entering the cell [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. PUFAs, such as AA and DHA, usually occupy the 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 position of the glycerol backbone, while saturated FAs normally are in 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1 [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This specificity is conserved also in the dedicated enzymes for their de-esterification, since phospholipase A-1 (PLA-1) acts on fatty acids in 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-1 and phospholipase A-2 (PLA-2) is specific for 
 <italic class="italic">sn</italic>-2 lipids, such as DHA and AA [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that DHA turnover can be modulated without affecting AA metabolism, indicating a selective regulation among these two FAs. In particular, calcium-independent PLA-2 is selective for DHA release [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Upon PLA-2-induced release, around 90% of PUFAs are esterified back to phospholipids, while the remaining portion may be metabolized to active derivatives through the action of different enzymes such as cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LOX) and cytochrome P450 [
