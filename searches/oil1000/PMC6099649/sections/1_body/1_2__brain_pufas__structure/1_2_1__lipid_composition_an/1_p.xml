<p class="p">The brain contains a high concentration and variety of lipids, especially fatty acids (FAs), second only to adipose tissue. The composition of FAs in the brain is very complex, and AA and DHA represent the most abundant polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In particular, DHA reaches 10% of total FAs in the brain [

Generally, phospholipids are present in the membrane as glycerophospholipids composed of mixed saturated and unsaturated FAs, with one and up to six double bonds. PUFAs are classified as omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) on the basis of the location of the last double bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule (
