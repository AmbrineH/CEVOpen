<p class="p">Finally, a major role in brain health involves the pro- or anti-inflammatory effect of molecules deriving from the catabolism of n-6 or n-3 PUFAs, respectively [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Several actions derived from PUFA metabolites have opposite effects depending on their n-3 or n-6 FA derivation [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. DHA and AA, de-esterified by PLA-2 enzymes, can be metabolized through different pathways, but generally, metabolites of n-3, such as DHA or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), show anti-inflammatory properties, while those deriving from AA show opposite effects [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Notably, COX2, which facilitates the formation of prostaglandin E2 from AA, is expressed at a higher level in neurons than in any other tissue. AA may also be converted to other metabolites, usually conducible to pro-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. On the contrary, DHA metabolites are less clearly identified, but the main known products include 17S-hydroxy-DHA, 14-hydroxy-DHA and LOX-induced resolvin D5, maresin 1 and neuroprotectin D1 [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. These molecules, at variance with AA products, are reported to act as “pro-resolving” mediators [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], since they are involved in an active mechanism of inflammation resolution. The discovery of mediators with anti-inflammatory or “pro-resolving” effects derived from n-3 PUFAs highlighted the presence of active pathways for inflammation resolution other than a “dilution effect”, able to actively compete with AA metabolites [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], underlining the importance of such protective mechanisms in the brain.
