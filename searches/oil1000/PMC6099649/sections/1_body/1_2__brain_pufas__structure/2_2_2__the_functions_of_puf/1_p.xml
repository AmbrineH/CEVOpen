<p class="p">Among the different FAs present in the brain, omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) are essential; therefore, they must be obtained from food [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-23-01531" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. These PUFAs are abundant in neuronal membranes and exert several important effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-01531-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, DHA and AA deficiencies lead to severe problems in the brains, since n-3 such as DHA is required for brain development and function, while n-6 such as AA yields essentials metabolic products. Increasing evidence suggests that a balanced dietary intake of these PUFAs has beneficial effects in maintaining the health state of the brain [
