<p class="p">Chinma et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) studied the addition of germinated 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour to wheat flour for cake production. Increase in Moringa level up to 40% increased the protein content from 13.14% to 23.10%. In addition, the fiber, iron, zinc, calcium, lipid, and ash contents also increased significantly with increase in Moringa level in the blend. In contrast, the increase in the level of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> reduced gradually the pasting properties in general, and particularly peak, final, and breakdown viscosities. The cake made from the blend showed significant decrease in acceptability. The bitter and astringent tastes were more pronounced on 40% substitution, while up to 30% substitution, the cake were rated favorably (Chinma et al.,
