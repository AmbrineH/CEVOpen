<p class="p">Ogunsina, Radha, and Indrani (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) evaluated the effect of wheat flour replacement with debittered 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> flour for cookies and bread formulation. 
 <italic class="italic">Moringa oleifera</italic> seeds were debittered by cooking at 100°C for 35 min. Breads were more accepted at mixture wheat/Moringa ratio 90/10, while cookies were accepted at ratio 80/20. The bread had an acceptable characteristic taste of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed, while cookies had a hazelnut after‐taste in the mouth. The products were rich in protein and other essential nutrients such as iron and calcium which are seldom found in daily diets. Thus, the substitution rate of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour depends on the treatment applied with 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed germination favoring a high substitution rate compared to seeds boiling (Ogunsina et al.,
