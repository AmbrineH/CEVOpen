They found that supplementation increased nutritional potential (protein, ash, and lipid) but reduced functional and pasting properties and moisture content of product, leading to increased shelf life. This favors the use of Moringa flour as a protein source to supplement local/traditional cereals such as maize, sorghum, millet (Jude‐Ojei et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) evaluated the sensory attributes of the incorporation (2%, 5%, and 7.5%) of Moringa seed flour in the preparation of the maize snack (maize/Moringa snack). They found that increasing the Moringa rate increased the nutrient composition (protein, ash, lipid, fiber) and reduced some functional properties (swelling capacity, bulk density). The general acceptability of the snacks of the four different blends showed that snacks containing 7.5% Moringa flour were very well accepted by panelists in terms of color, crispness, taste, aroma, and general acceptability.
