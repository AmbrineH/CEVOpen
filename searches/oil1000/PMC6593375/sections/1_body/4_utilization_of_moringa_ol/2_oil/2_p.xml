<p class="p">Moringa seed oil gathered good thermal, oxidative, and frying stabilities. Ogunsina et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) studied the effect of extraction method and temperature, and storage time on the physicochemical properties of Moringa oil. The peroxide index of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> oil Var 
 <italic class="italic">Jaffina</italic> during 42 days of storage varied from 1.2 to 5.6 meq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg. This variation was significantly lower than that of groundnut oil which was 3–26.93 meq O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/kg in the same condition of extraction and storage. The higher stability of Moringa oil when compared to groundnut oil may be attributed to their lower polyunsaturated fatty acid level. Although unsaturation in fatty acid generally increases the susceptibility of oil to oxidation, polyunsaturated fatty acids are the most incriminated in the oxidative stability of oil (Bhatnagar, Prasanthkumar, Hemavathy, &amp; Gopalakrishna, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Abdulkarim , Long, Lai, Muhammad, and Ghazali (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) assay the use of Moringa oil in comparison with groundnut oil in potato frying. They observed that the free fatty acids increased for 28.6% in Moringa oil and 48.6% in groundnut oil. The increase in free fatty acid during frying is a normal reaction which starts with water liberation from the product being fried followed by thermal hydrolysis of the acylglyceride into fatty acid and glyceride. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of the ester bond of acylglycerol by water (Choe &amp; Min, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Whatever the case, Moringa oil is less likely to hydrolysis than groundnut oil. In this respect, cold‐pressed oils from 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds are better than the raw commercial oils and refined groundnut oils. In the same vein, Khattab and Shakak (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) showed that during frying of potato chips, 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> oil was more stable to oxidation (based on peroxide, free fatty acid, density, viscosity, and refraction index) compared to groundnut oil and the mixture (1/1 ratio) of both. In addition, the acceptability (taste, color, odor, texture, and general acceptability) of potato chips analyzed by a panel of seventeen students was higher as compared to those made from groundnut oil, but lower than that obtained from the mixture of Moringa and groundnut oils (Khattab and Shakak, (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Based on the current results, 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed oil showed enough promises to be regarded as a more stable and healthy oil in cooking and frying.
