 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) studied the composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> as affected by cooking time (10, 20 and 30 min), and they observed 20% reduction of the lipids and ashes due to the leaching during cooking, and an increase in proteins from 26.7% to 32.0%. Heating 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds at temperatures 100, 130, and 150°C during 30 min induced an increase in oil content from 28.9% to 33.7%, 32.2%, and 30.9%, respectively (Adejumo, Alakowe, &amp; Obi, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In addition, the physicochemical parameters of oil were also significantly affected. In particular, oil density diminished from 1.05 to 0.99, 0.97, and 0.95 kg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>; the saponification index diminished from 252.3 to 230.8, 218.8, and 177.7; the free fatty acids diminished from 5.80 to 2.74, 2.70, and 2.71 mg/KOH/g; the acid value diminished from 2.73 to 1.37, 1.36, and 1.35 mmol/kg; and the iodine index changed from 72.4 to 69.3, 66.7, and 66.6. In conclusion, heating had no significant influence on the specific gravity and density of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds oil while it reduced the physicochemical characteristics (Adejumo et al.,
