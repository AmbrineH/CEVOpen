 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds increased the calcium, zinc, iron, lipids, carbohydrate, fiber, and ash contents, the percentage change being higher as the roasting time increased. The increase was assigned to the loss of water during roasting. Besides, vitamin A and B1 levels significantly decreased, while an increase in protein content was observed after 20 min of roasting. Significant reduction in tannins and increase in saponin and phytate contents were observed after roasting. On the other hand, the oxalate content increased initially (3.58% at 10 min) before dropping gradually to reach the value of raw seeds (2.87% at 30 min and raw seeds). In addition, this treatment (roasting at 70°C during 15 min) was also used by Compaoré, Nikièma, Bassolé, Savadogo, Hounhouigan, et al.
