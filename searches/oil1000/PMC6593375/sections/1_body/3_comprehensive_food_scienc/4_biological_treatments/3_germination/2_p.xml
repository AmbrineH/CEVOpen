<p class="p">Germination is a normal biological process of plants by which the seeds leave the latency stage (Sangronis &amp; Machado, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). During germination, some changes occur in terms of quantity and type of nutrients in seed. These changes could be due to the type and variety of seed and germination conditions (Dhaliwal &amp; Aggarwal, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). An increase of minerals, increase of protein bioavailability, and a reduction of secondary metabolites of foodstuffs are observed during germination (Hassan, Babiker, &amp; Tinay, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Kouakou, Alexis, Adjehi, Marcelin, &amp; Dago, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Several studies reported the effect of germination on the nutritional properties of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds. Germination had no significant effect on ash (4.8%–4.3%), fiber (5.0%–5.5%), and carbohydrate (53.4%–53.0%) contents. However, the protein (18.9%–23.7%) and lipid (13.4%–14.6%) contents significantly increased with germination (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Significant reduction in the tannin (247.6%–181.7%), phytate (78.33%–40%), polyphenol (40%–34.3%), alkaloid (17.3%–15.3%), and saponin (9.8%–8%) contents was equally reported (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). According to Chinma, Gbadamosi, Ogunsina, Oloyede, and Salami, (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), germination of 12h with changing of water all the 2 hr in order to avoid any spontaneous fermentation reduced the bitterness and astringency caused by antinutrients.
