<p class="p">Most of the secondary metabolites equally diminished during fermentation of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds. Thus, phytates (78.33%–28.33%), tannins (241.67%–146.67%), polyphenols (40%–23%), alkaloids (17.33%–12.33%), flavonoids (5.50%–5%), and saponins (9.83%–7.50%) drop under the effect of fermentation except terpenoids (20%–27.50%) (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The low palatability of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds was attributed to its high tannin content in which the decrease during fermentation might improve its acceptability when incorporated into food (Mehansho, Buttler, &amp; Carbon, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1987</xref>). Comparatively, alkaloid content of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds was lower compared to recommended level of 60 mg/100 g for healthy food (McDonald, Edwards, Greenhalgh, &amp; Morgan,
