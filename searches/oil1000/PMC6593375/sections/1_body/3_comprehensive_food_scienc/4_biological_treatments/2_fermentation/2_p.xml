<p class="p">Ijarotimi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) studied the effect of natural fermentation on the proximate composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds. The protein content increased from 18.9% to 21.2%. Similarly, the carbohydrate content increased from 53% to 61%, while no significant change was observed on the lipid content (13.4%–14.0%), the crude fiber content (5.0%–6.2%), and ash content (4.8%–4.5%). In accordance with the decrease in ash content, significant reductions of almost all the minerals (mg/100 g) of seed were observed (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>): calcium (128.33–121.67), phosphorus (103.33–91.67), iron (7.33–5.63), sodium (295.1–280.3), potassium (52.33–43.67), magnesium (26.33–25.13), copper (0.63–0.57), and iodine (0.11–0.10). This also affected some mineral ratios such as sodium/potassium ratio (5.65 to 6.42) and calcium/phosphorus (1.24–1.33) which are indicators of body balance and bone formations (Nieman et al.,

 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds should be prohibited in people with risk of hypertension (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The Ca/P ratio higher than 1, along with the contents in Ca and P (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), gives 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds advantage to support growth of children (Nieman et al.,
