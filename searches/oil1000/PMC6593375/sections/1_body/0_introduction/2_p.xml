 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1980</xref>). This plant is now cultivated in all tropical and subtropical regions such as Pakistan, Arabia, Central America, North and the South Philippines, Cambodia, Caribbean Islands, and Africa (Morton,

 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). This is due to its resistance to different climates, poor and averagely dry soils, and the multiple properties which abound to this plant (Morton,
