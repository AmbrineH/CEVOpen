 <italic class="italic">Moringa oleifera</italic> seeds have been the subject of many research activities. Moringa seeds are sources of proteins, lipids, fats, soluble vitamins, and antioxidants. The proteins are particularly poor in lysine, sulfur amino acids, and tryptophan. The principal component of the oil is oleic acid, and the oil is perfectly tested in frying and seasoning. Based on their level in antioxidant in general, and in particular tocopherol, phytosterol, and carotenoids, the whole 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> flour (2%–6%) also demonstrates preservative role in meat products. The seed is bitter and astringent; the untreated and soaked seeds are equally toxic when consumed. A process for debittering the seeds completely and used in some food preparation has been documented. Some research addressed the functional properties of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour with some technological applications in biscuits and infant flour formulations. However, the bitterness and toxicity of the flour are still a limit for their utilization. Furthermore, the oil is not only free of toxicant, but it also exhibited high biological value as compared to commercial oil.
