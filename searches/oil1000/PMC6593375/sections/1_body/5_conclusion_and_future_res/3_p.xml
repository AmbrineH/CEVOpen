<p class="p">With the global shortage of food grains and ever increasing human population, 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> will certainly offer good alternative to food shortage. In particular, it easily grows under dry climates of the sub‐Saharan areas which generally future food crisis. For 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds to play that role, more research in the effect of treatments on the functionality and the nutritional and physicochemical properties of the oil and defatted seed flour should be addressed. For instance, the combined effect of roasting, germination, and cooking on the in vivo nutritional quality and toxicity of the flour and fat could be tested. Formulation of value‐added products from 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> oils and flour, such as ingredients for preservation, nutraceutical with immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory actions, may also offer good perspectives to the seeds. Investigations of the effect of consumption of Moringa seeds and products enriched with Moringa seeds on some markers of toxicity in humans are also envisaged.
