<p class="p">Globally, studies on the functional properties revealed that defatted Moringa flour exhibited higher foaming capacity and stability, higher emulsifying capacity, and lower WAC and viscosity. In addition, the fat absorption capacity was significantly higher than the WAC, making Moringa flour a potential stabilizer for food emulsion and foaming systems.</p>
