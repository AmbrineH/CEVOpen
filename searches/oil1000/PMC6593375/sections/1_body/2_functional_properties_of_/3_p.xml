<p class="p">The foaming capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour significantly increase with fermentation (25.93%–29.63%) and germination (25.93%–37.70%) (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Ijarotimi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) equally reported increased swelling capacity following fermentation (from 1.27 to 1.50), while germination had no significant effect on it (1.27%–1.33%). The water absorption capacity (WAC) of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour was 80.3 g/ml lower than that of most cereal and legume flours. Fermentation increased the WAC to 141 g/ml, while germination had no significant effect (Ijarotimi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Besides, Ogunsina, Radha, and Sign (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) compared the functional properties of full‐fat and defatted 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour. The nitrogen solubility was lowest, that is, 27.8% and 29.2% at pH of 4.0 and 9.0 respectively for full‐fat and defatted 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour, while maximum solubility occurred at pH 6.0. Defatting increased the water absorption (115.7–130.5 g H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O/100 g) and fat absorption (129.8–208 g oil/100 g) capacities of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour. The foaming capacity and foam stability of the defatted flour were 86.0% and 82.0 ml, whereas those of full‐fat flour were 20.6% and 18.5 ml, respectively. The defatted flour showed better emulsification (97.2 ml/g) than full‐fat flour (66.0 ml/g). The least gelation concentrations of the defatted and full‐fat flours were 14% and 16% (w/ v), respectively.
