 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) showed that 71‐hr natural fermentation of defatted 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed flour increased significantly the WAC (0.86–2.31 g/ml), oil absorption capacity (0.87–1.91 g/ml), foaming capacity (9.76%–16.31%), and emulsifying capacity (50.71%–68.75%). Concomitantly, natural fermentation induced a significant decrease in bulk density (0.53–0.32 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and dispersibility (36.00%–20.50%). Significant increases in pasting properties of the flour with fermentation were also reported: peak viscosity (15–34 RVU), true viscosity (11–21.5 RVU), breakdown viscosity (4–14.5 RVU), final viscosity (16–36 RVU), and setback (5–17.5 RVU).
