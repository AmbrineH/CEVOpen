 <italic class="italic">Moringa oleifera</italic> seeds are a protein source, and they represent the second major component of these seeds after lipids. Recent studies reported protein content varying between 18.6% (Kawo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and 37.2% (Bridgemohan, Bridgemohan, &amp; Mohamed,

 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, the protein composition of the seeds can cover only the requirements in some essential and semiessential amino acids for humans (histidine, threonine, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine) except methionine, lysine, valine, and tryptophan, considered as limiting amino acids (Table
