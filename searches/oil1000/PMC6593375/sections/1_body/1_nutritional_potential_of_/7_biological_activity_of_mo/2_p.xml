<p class="p">Very few studies are reported on 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seed as proteins sources. Oliveira, Silveira, Vasconcelos, Cavada, and Moreira (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) reported that consumption of crude seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> induced deleterious effects in Wistar rats. They associated the toxicity of the seeds to lectin (hemagglutinin) previously reported in 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds (Santos, Argolo, Coelho, &amp; Paiva, 
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Ben Salem and Makkar (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) observed that defatted Moringa seed, incorporated in meal at levels up to 4 g/day, had positive effects on rumen fermentation, digestion and performance of lambs. The authors equally observed a reduction in the overall performance of the lambs at a feeding level of only 6 g/day, and this was associated with the presence of glucosinolates. Besides, Igwilo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31057-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) showed that 30 min soaked 
 <italic class="italic">M. oleifera</italic> seeds did not support growth, and induced threat for the liver of Wistar albinos rats fed for 21 days. No study reported the utilization of Moringa seeds.
