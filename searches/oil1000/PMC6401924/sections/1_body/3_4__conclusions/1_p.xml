<p class="p">A novel method was developed to synthesize PTOP and PTOSi, which were proved to be effective flame-retardant polyols used in the formation of RPUF with excellent flame retardancy. Different PTOP and PTOSi contents affect the thermal stability, flame retardancy, and mechanical properties of RPUF. Results from FTIR, TG, DSC, and LOI revealed that DOPO and DPSD are linked to EGTO by a covalent bond, and the thermal stability of PTOP was higher than that for PTOSi. The thermal stability and flame retardancy of RPUF increased, with the LOI value of RPUFs with 80% PTOP and PTOSi reaching 24.0% and 23.4%, respectively. PTOP and PTOSi could be acted as the soft segment and hard segment in RPUF, respectively. The compressive strength of RPUF was reduced to 0.75 MPa with 80 wt % PTOP, while the compressive strength of RPUF increased to 0.25 MPa with 80 wt % PTOSi. A comparison of the flame-retardant mechanism of RPUF prepared by PTOP and PTOSi showed that RPUF with PTOP released an acid source and polyphosphate compound while RPUF with PTOSi burned out silicon dioxide on the surface. Based on the LOI value of RPUF, PTOP showed better flame-retardant performance than that of PTOSi.</p>
