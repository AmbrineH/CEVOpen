 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> presents the FTIR spectra of EGTO, PTOP, and PTOSi. Hydroxyl absorption in EGTO appeared at 3440 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, while the –CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>– stretching vibration peaks appeared at 2930 and 2850 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The stretching vibration at 900 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> belonged to the epoxy group in EGTO [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The characteristic peak for P(O)–H stretching of DOPO in PTOP at 2428 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> disappeared, while a broad peak appeared at 3340 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, indicating that the epoxy ring in EGTO opened and a hydroxyl group was formed. Simultaneously, the characteristic –OH peak in PTOP occurred around 3440 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, while the absorption peak at 1590 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was attributed to P–Ph, and the absorbing peaks of P=O appeared at 1232 and 1198 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The absorption peaks around 1043 and 918 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> corresponded to P–O–C and P–O–Ph vibrations, which are characteristics of EGTO and DOPO, respectively [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The absorption peaks on the FTIR spectrum of PTOSi were consistent with observations from the literature [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The presence of a pronounced peak at 1450 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> characteristic of benzene was significant. Peaks at 1070–1130 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> corresponded to C–O and Si–O bonding [
 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], and the stretching vibration of two peaks at 880 and 730 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were assigned to the Si–C and C–H bonds of benzene. All the above changes confirmed that PTOP and PTOSi were formed via the ring opening reaction.
