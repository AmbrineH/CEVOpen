 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a presents peaks at 0.9 ppm and 2.5 ppm, which were attributed to methyl protons (peak 1) and fatty acid protons [(–CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) –CO–] (peak 5), respectively. While protons in –CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>– (peak 6) from glycerol appeared from 4.0 to 4.1 ppm, the peak at 5.3 to 5.4 ppm was attributed to the carbon–carbon double bond. The peak at 3.3 ppm in the EGTO spectra indicates that the epoxy group (peak 3) was formed after epoxidation. The peak at 1.9 ppm corresponded to the hydrogen (peak 8) attached to the carbon adjacent to –OH and the peak that appeared at 2.0 ppm represented the hydrogen atoms adjacent to the ester bond [–O–CO–] (peak 7). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>b, the chemical shifts at 7.2–8.2 ppm (peak 10) indicated the Ar–H of PTOP, while the absorption peaks at 8.65 ppm (peak 11) and 3.60 ppm (peak 12) represented the P–C–H and –OH of PTOP, respectively. All of these characteristic 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR bands matched the PTOP structure. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c, the peaks at 7.2–8.2 ppm (peak 14) were associated with the Ar–H of PTOSi, while the peak at 3.4 ppm (peak 17) was characteristic of the –OH of DPSD that formed from the epoxy group via a ring opening reaction. The peak at 2.8 ppm (peak 16) was assigned to Si–O–CH–, while the –Si–OH peak appeared at 2.66 ppm (peak 15). Furthermore, PTOP exhibits a single peak at 35.50 ppm while there is no peak at 14.90 ppm in the 
 <sup class="sup">31</sup>PNMR spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The chemical shift at 14.90 ppm was attributed to DOPO, which reveals that the reaction between DOPO and EGTO was completed.
