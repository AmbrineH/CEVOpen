<p class="p">To confirm that P-containing compounds and Si-containing compounds were retained in the residue and acted as the flame retardant barrier. The microstructure of the residue after combustion was examined by SEM, RPUF/P60, RPUF/P80, RPUF/Si60, and RPUF/Si80 had the compacted and smooth char. EDAX (energy dispersive spectroscopy) associated with SEM was used to get the elemental composition of residues of RPUF. 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00045-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> shows the surface composition of the residues obtained by EDAX. As can be observed from 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00045-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>, C and O were the main remaining elements. The char layer of RPUF/P60 and RPUF/P80 can compress well to form a protective phosphatic barrier to resist the transfer of heat and mass during fire. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>, a number of flaws were found on the surface of RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80, which may be the result of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forming and moving onto the surface during burning. PTOP and PTOSi have the effect of promoting the char layers, as compacted char layers may prevent the internal products of pyrolysis from transferring to the flame zone.
