<p class="p">THR curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref> illustrate that the value of THR decreases in the order of RPUF/P60&gt;RPUF/Si60&gt;RPUF/Si80&gt;RPUF/P80. For example, the THR of RPUF/P80 is 18.40 MJ·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, a 19.30% reduction compared to that of RPUF/P60. There are two reasons for this result. On the one hand, heat is taken away by the condensed-phase and gas-phase actions of the volatile aromatic phosphates in RPUF/P60 and RPUF/P80. On the other hand, the barrier layer produced by PTOP and PTOSi can prevent heat, oxygen and flammable substance from transferring. Moreover, non-flammable gas in the gas phase system can also effectively reduce the heat released from RPUF/P80 [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In comparing to RPUF/Si60, RPUF/Si80 has the preferable flame-retardant property indicated by both the LOI value and CTT. The excellent flame-retardant behavior of PTOSi was illustrated by its better dispersion within the RPUF and movement towards the RPUF surface during the burning process. A highly flame-retardant char generated from the combustion of PTOSi can reduce the total heat released.
