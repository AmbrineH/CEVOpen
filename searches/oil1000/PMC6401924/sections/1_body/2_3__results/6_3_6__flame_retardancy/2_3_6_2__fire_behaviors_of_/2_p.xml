RPUF ignited within the first few seconds (about 2â€“3 s) of exposure to heat burned steadily for 175 to 230 s. The first sharp peaks for RPUF were turned up at 35, 40, 30, and 40 s, respectively. Then, narrow peaks for each RPUF appeared at 75, 60, 60, and 65 s. The protective char layer formed from the first peak in the HRR curves, then the protective char layer was degraded, which is represented by the second peak was [

The HRR peaks for RPUF/P80 and RPUF/Si80 were slightly smaller and thinner, while the peak times were lengthened with an increase in the amount of PTOP and PTOSi. This may be attributed to the introduction of PTOP and PTOSi into the soft segments, contributing to the formation of the protective and continuous char layer.
