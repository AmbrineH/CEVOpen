<p class="p">Based on related parameters such as PHRR and THR presented in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00045-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>, the flame-retardant efficiency of PTOP is higher than that of PTOSi. This result accounts for the fact that PTOP can migrate to the surface of the RPUF during combustion and allow for the formation of the condensed-phase and gas-phase of volatile aromatic phosphates. This indicates that the addition of PTOP and PTOSi can boost the fire-inhibition activity during combustion.
