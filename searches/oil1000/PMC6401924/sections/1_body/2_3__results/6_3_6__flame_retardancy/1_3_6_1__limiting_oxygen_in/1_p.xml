 <xref rid="polymers-11-00045-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>, where it can be seen that they are higher than that of neat RPUF, which is 19.0%. With increasing amounts of PTOP and PTOSi, the LOI value increased from 21.3% for RPUF/P60 to 24.0% for RPUF/P80, while a lower increase in the LOI value was observed for RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80 from 21.0% to 23.4%. This result was attributed to the large number of PO
