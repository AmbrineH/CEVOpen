<p class="p">Thermal property of RPUF was also studied by DSC, the corresponding heating thermograms are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>. The molecular chain of polyurethane foam was generally composed of the soft segment and hard segment. At the room temperature, soft segment was in an elastomeric state, which has an effect on low temperature performance, flexibility, organic solvent resistance and the weather-ability on RPUF. While the hard segment was in a glassy or crystalline state, which affects the melting point, thermal stability, hardness and modulus of RPUF. The temperature range of glassy transition of RPUF was from 29 to 102 °C, the
