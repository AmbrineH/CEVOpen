<p class="p">Thermal degradation of RPUF/P60 and RPUF/P80 showed four stages at 100 to 200 °C, 200 to 350 °C, 350 to 450 °C, and 450 to 600 °C, respectively. The first stage was attributed to the entrapment of volatile compounds in closed cells, while the other stages were attributed to the hard and soft segments of polyurethane. With an increase in the PTOP content of RPUF, the residue rate at 600 °C after complete decomposition becomes smaller, indicating that the degradation products of DOPO have mainly decomposed to form volatile products. The initial decomposition temperature of RPUF/P80 was lower than that of RPUF/P60, and the decreased

The condensation, chain scission, and cross-linking reactions of PTOP and the decomposition mechanism of PTOP in RPUF were summarized in that acid source, and polyphosphate compound could be produced via degradation in the step III.
