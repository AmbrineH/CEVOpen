<p class="p">The initial thermal decomposition and residue rates of RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80 were similar to those for RPUF/P60 and RPUF/P80, while the change in following characteristic parameters such as 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> were contrary. The degradation of RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80 was divided into two steps. The original degradation was ascribed to the urethane unit in the cross-linking network. Substances containing benzene structures and Si-containing groups in the RPUF were degraded when the temperature was raised.
