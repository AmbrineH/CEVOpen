 <xref rid="polymers-11-00045-t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref> shows that the trend in RPUF density is opposite to the trend noted for compressive strength. With large amounts of PTOP and PTOSi added into the blended polyols component, the PTOP and PTOSi may disperse poorly, which can interfere with the development of the cell and make the cell size larger and the number of closed cells lower (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). PTOP can reduce the compressive strength of RPUF, while the higher content of PTOSi incorporated into RPUF can increase the compressive strength. A similar result was obtained for Ïƒ
 <sub class="sub">sp</sub>. When the PTOP content was below 60%, PTOP dispersed well in the blended polyols component, and almost no agglomeration appeared. PTOSi with its self-crosslinking function can make the RPUF matrix easily collapsible due to the wall fragility of the foam cell, resulting in the worse value of compressive strength.
