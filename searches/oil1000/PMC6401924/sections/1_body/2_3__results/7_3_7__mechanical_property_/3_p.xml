<p class="p">RPUF is also used as the thermal insulation material in building insulation. The best method for improving the sustainability of building insulation is to diminish the thermal conductivity of RPUF. With an increase in the PTOP and PTOSi content, the thermal conductivity of RPUF decreased as the thermal conductivity is mainly affected by the average cell size. The thermal conductivity of RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80 were higher than that of RPUF/P60 and RPUF/P80 due to the lower closed cell content, which is influenced by the degree of cross-linking, the equivalent weight of blended polyols and the content of various agents. Therefore, the molecular weight of polyurethane in RPUF/P60 and RPUF/P80 was lower than that for RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80.</p>
