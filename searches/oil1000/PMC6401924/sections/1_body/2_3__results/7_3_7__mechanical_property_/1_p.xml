<p class="p">Mechanical property is an essential issue for the practical application of RPUF, which was further investigated, such as density, compressive strength and thermal conductivity. In order to eliminate the effect of RPUF density on the compressive strength, the specific compressive strength (compressive strength/density) was used to for comparison. </p>
