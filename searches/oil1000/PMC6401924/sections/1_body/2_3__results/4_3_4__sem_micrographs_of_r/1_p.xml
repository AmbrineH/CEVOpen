<p class="p">The SEM micrographs of RPUF are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, where the main structural areas noted are the cells, cell walls, and wall joints [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The size range of the cells increased with an increase in PTOP content. This phenomenon was also observed for RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80 with an increase in PTOSi content. It was noted that a number of foam cell orifices and the size of regular cells in RPUF/P60 were consistent with those in RPUF/Si60. However, for RPUF/P80 and RPUF/Si80, the number of cell windows is decreased. The insufficient cross-linking action of PTOP and PTOSi with low functionality leads to a decrease in the number of closed foam cells, and the collapse of the newly formed foam structure due to the decrease in the number of closed foam cells.
