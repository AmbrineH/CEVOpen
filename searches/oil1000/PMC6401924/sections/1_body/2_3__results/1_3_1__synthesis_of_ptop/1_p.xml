<p class="p">The reaction progress of PTOP was monitored by GPC at different times. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a, the peak at 17.25 min was attributed to DOPO, and the broad peak from 10 min to 15.40 min was assigned to PTOP, while the narrow peak from 15.40 min to 16.50 min was assigned to EGTO. Due to the excessive amount of EGTO, the peak representing EGTO was evident during the PTOP reaction process. The DOPO peak almost disappeared at 2 h, which implies that the reaction between DOPO and EGTO was completed. It can be seen from the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00045-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>e,d that no DOPO remained after 2 h at 130 °C and 140 °C. High temperatures may cause other side reactions to occur. Thus, the synthesis of PTOP was conducted for 2 h at a temperature below 130 °C.
