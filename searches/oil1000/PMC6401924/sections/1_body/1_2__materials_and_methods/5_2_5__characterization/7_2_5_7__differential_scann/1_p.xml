<p class="p">The thermal property of RPUF was analyzed by DSC on a NETZSCH DSC 200F3 (Gebruder-Netzsch-Straße, Germany). Samples of about 10 mg were weighed and sealed in the aluminum DSC pans and placed in the DSC cell. They were first cooled for 0.5 min at −60 °C, and then heated from −60 to 200 °C at the rate of 20 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. They were kept at 200 °C for 0.5 min to eliminate the previous heat history and subsequently cooled to −60 °C at 20 °C/min. Lastly, they were heated again to 200 °C at 20 °C/min.</p>
