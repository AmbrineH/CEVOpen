<p class="p">The synthesis of the tung oil monoglyceride (GTO) was carried out as described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The epoxidized monoglyceride of tung oil (EGTO) was prepared as follows: 100 g of GTO (0.46 mol carbon-carbon double bond), CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>COOH (0.92 mol) and TsOH·H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O (0.046 mol) were added to a round-bottom flask. Hydrogen peroxide solution (0.69 mol H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) was added dropwise over a period of 1 h and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 to 5 h at a temperature of 55 °C. The EGTO product was neutralized with 1 mol/L sodium hydrocarbonate solution and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate solvent was removed by reduced pressure distillation. EGTO was obtained and its epoxy value was 3%. The synthesis of GTO and EGTO is illustrated in
