<p class="p">RPUF was prepared using a one-step method. The raw materials and formulations used in the preparation of RPUF are listed in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00045-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Firstly, Part A was made up of AK8804, DBTDL, blowing agent, water, PPG4110 and flame-retardant polyols. Then, the mixture of PAPI (Part B) and Part A was stirred for 2 min at approximately 2000–2500 rpm to ensure homogeneous mixing. At the end, the mixture was poured into a mold and allowed to cure at 80 °C for 24 h. The P content of blended polyols of RPUF/P60 and RPUF/P80 were 1.11% and 1.48%, respectively, and the Si content of blended polyols of RPUF/Si60 and RPUF/Si80 were 1.14% and 1.52%, respectively.
