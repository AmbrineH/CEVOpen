<p class="p">The reaction equations for PTOP and PTOSi are shown in

 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="polymers-11-00045-sch003" class="xref">Scheme 3</xref> and the parameters for PTOP and PTOSi are summarized in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00045-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The reaction temperature and time of PTOP were 130 °C and 120 min, respectively. After the reaction, the product was allowed to cool to room temperature and to stand for 48 h, after which a small amount of unreacted DOPO precipitated as a white solid. The brown clear transparent liquid at the top was washed to neutral with distilled water, which was distilled by vacuum distillation. The conversion rate of DOPO was obtained by comparing the change in the epoxy value of PTOP with that of EGTO. EGTO and DPSD were blended and heated to 140 °C for 2 h. After the product was cooled down to room temperature and allowed to stand for 48 h, a small amount of the white solid of the unreacted DPSD subsided, the top brown clear transparent liquid was washed to neutral with distilled water and water was removed by reduced pressure distillation. The conversion rate of PTOSi was obtained by comparing the change in the epoxy value of PTOSi with that of EGTO.
