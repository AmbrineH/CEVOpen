<p class="p">The compound 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene (DOPO) [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] is an environmentally friendly reactive flame retardant that has attracted considerable attention because of its outstanding thermal stability and ability to resist oxidation and hydrolysis [
 <xref rid="B14-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Due to its aromatic and phenanthrene ring structure, DOPO is more thermally and chemically stable than standard organic phosphate, and little toxic gas is released during its combustion [
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The flame-retardant ability of DOPO has been attributed to the formation of a reactive substance such as PO
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>, which is released to the gas phase where it engages with H· and OH· groups and disrupts the combustion process [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. DOPO exhibits prominent gas-phase flame retardant properties during RPUF combustion [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Modification of RPUF through the incorporation of silicon-containing flame retardants is also recognized as an environmentally friendly method that reduces flammability [
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Silicone materials show good flame-retardant properties through the formation of char barriers (Si–C, Si–O) at the surface of the polymer at high temperatures [
 <xref rid="B20-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. There are two ways to enhance the flame retardancy of RPUF, one of which is the addition of the inorganic silicon such as nano-silica and whisker silicon oxide [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and the other of which is the introduction of silicon into the structure of polyols using 3-aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane (APTES),

 <xref rid="B22-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This has resulted in the development of novel reactive flame retardants for RPUF. Tung oil-based flame-retardant polyols have not been reported previously.
