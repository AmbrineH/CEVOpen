<p class="p">The depletion of petroleum reserves is driving the development of polymers and polymer additives from sustainable bio-materials. Polymer materials made from renewable sources have attracted attention around the world [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Vegetable oils are particularly promising renewable chemicals for the preparation of polyols and rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) due to their renewability, universal availability, and environmental compatibility. Vegetable oils have double bonds, ester groups and other reactive sites that can be modified to form new polyol structures [

 <xref rid="B6-polymers-11-00045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] have been used to produce RPUF. RPUF has been widely used in materials for building insulation due to its excellent mechanical performance. However, a limitation to the use of RPUF is flammability, which is related to its cellular structure and low density [
