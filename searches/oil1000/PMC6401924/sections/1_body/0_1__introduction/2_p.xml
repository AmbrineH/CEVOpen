<p class="p">In recent years, much effort has been devoted to increasing the flame-retardant properties of RPUF. Conventional methods of flame-retardant treatment for RPUF include the incorporation of flame-retardant additives based on phosphorus, silicone, nitrogen, and halogen compounds. While these flame-retardant additives impart excellent flame retardancy to RPUF, the introduction of larger amounts of flame retardants may have an adverse effect on the mechanical and physical characteristics of RPUF [

When burning, flame retardants that contain halogens release a lot of harmful gases and bring about environmental pollution. More importantly, organohalogen compounds fragmenting from the polymers are stable and able to persist and bioaccumulate in the environment, and thus may pose a risk to human health [

The main benefit of reactive flame retardants compared to other flame-retardant additives is that the flame-retardant molecule is linked to the RPUF structure with a covalent bond [
