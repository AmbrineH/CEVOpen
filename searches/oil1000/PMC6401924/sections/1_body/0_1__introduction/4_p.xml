<p class="p">The goal of this work was to develop an innovative RPUF based on the incorporation of a phosphorus-containing tung oil-based polyol (PTOP) and a silicon-containing tung oil-based polyol (PTOSi). The molecular structure of the compounds and the thermal properties of the two new tung oil-based flame-retardant polyols were characterized using FTIR, 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup class="sup">31</sup>P NMR, and TG. RPUFs were characterized for their thermal and flame-retardant behaviors using several analytical techniques.
