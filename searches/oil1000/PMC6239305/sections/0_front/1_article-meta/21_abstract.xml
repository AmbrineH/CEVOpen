 <p class="p">The use of plant essential oils has been shown to efficiently control insect pests of stored beans, significantly reducing the threats associated with synthetic insecticides. Here, we evaluated the potential of applications of essential oils of clove, 
  <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> L., and cinnamon, 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> L., to control 
  <italic class="italic">Callosobruchus maculatus</italic>, considered as one of the most cosmopolitan pests of stored beans. Using four combinations of couples (i.e., unexposed couples, exposed females, exposed males, and exposed couples), we also evaluated how sublethal exposure to these essential oils impacted 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> oviposition. Bioassays results revealed that both essential oils exhibited insecticidal activities similar to the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin. Furthermore, oil dosage increments proportionately decreased the growth rate and reduced the losses in bean weight caused by cowpea weevils, and offspring emergence was almost abolished when parents were exposed to the LD
  <sub class="sub">20</sub> of each essential oil. Finally, significant oviposition impairments were perceived only in couples where females were exposed (i.e., females exposed and exposed couples) to the LD
  <sub class="sub">20</sub> of cinnamon and clove essential oils. Thus, by exhibiting similar insecticidal activities as synthetic insecticides and by significantly affecting the oviposition of sublethally exposed 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> females, the cinnamon and clove essential oils represent valuable tools with potential of integration into the management of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> infestations.
