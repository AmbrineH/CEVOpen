 <p> Effects of sublethal exposure to essential oils on C. maculatus oviposition. Number of eggs of C. maculatus females that were sublethally exposed to clove ( A) or cinnamon ( B) essential oils and coupled with essential oil-treated or essential oil-untreated partners. The symbols represent the means of 20 replicates (Â± SD) for the number of eggs laid by females of C. maculatus at three-day intervals (left panels) and the cumulative number of eggs (right panels) laid on cowpea bean masses during the first 9 days of adulthood. On the right panels, the treatments grouped by the same horizontal line did not differ according to a Tukey HSD test ( P &lt; 0.05). </p>
