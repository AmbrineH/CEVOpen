<p class="p">Thus, it is urgently needed to develop alternatives to the chemical control of

 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> that not only can reduce the concerns outlined above but also can be prone of embracing the actual trend in developing new botanical-derived insecticides based on the inclusion of the active ingredient (i.e. EOs) in stable delivery systems (nanoparticles, nanoemulsion, etc) [
