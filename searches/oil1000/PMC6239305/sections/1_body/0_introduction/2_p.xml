<p class="p">It has been well recognized that stored product pests when sublethally exposed to synthetic insecticides can exhibit not only detrimental (what is somehow expected), but under certain circumstances also positive responses on their physiology and behavior [

Although the mechanisms explaining such sublethal responses (i.e., positive or detrimental) are still not well understood, it has been described that individuals sublethally exposed to synthetic insecticides show alterations in relevant life traits (e.g., the development time, longevity, fertility, fecundity, immune capacities, locomotion, navigation, sexual communication, oviposition and feeding) [
 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. It is worthy to note, however, that similar life trait alterations seem to be elicited by sublethal exposure to botanical insecticides, which in their turn can trigger insect responses that either increase [
