 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. However, our oviposition results (i.e., females sublethally exposed to these essential oils decreased their ability to lay eggs even when they were offered to mate with untreated sexual partners in untreated bean masses) revealed an even more complex scenario and potential effects on sexual fitness (e.g., locomotory activities, mating behavior) or on the physiological basis of oviposition (e.g., respiratory activities, oogenesis or hormonal disruption) may also contribute to the reduced performance of essential oil sublethally exposed insects. For instance, similar physiological impairments (e.g., repellence, emergence inhibition, altered respiratory activities and transgenerational behavior changes) have been reported in stored product pests (e.g.,
