 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> and demonstrated that, even at sublethal doses, these botanical compounds impaired the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> to damage cowpea bean masses, which make them suitable tools that can be integrated into management programs of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic>, especially for storage facilities. Further work is also needed to test the applicability and efficacy of nanofomulations of these essential oils under broader stored products conditions.
