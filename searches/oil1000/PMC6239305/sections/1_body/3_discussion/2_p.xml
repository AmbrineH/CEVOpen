<p class="p">Essential oils, such as clove and cinnamon oils, are very complex natural mixtures and can contain various compounds at different concentrations with two or three major components that will determine the biological properties of the essential oil [
 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, synergistic effects between the components of essential oils have been frequently reported in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Our chemical analyses of cinnamon and clove essential oils revealed that their primarily components were eugenol (&gt;70.0%), followed by the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene (between 7.0 and 12%). These results are in concordance with previous studies that reported similar compositions [

 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. It is worth noting that cinnamon essential oil, despite its major components, also contained a range of other compounds, including acetyleugenol, benzyl benzoate, linalool, cinnamyl acetate and cinnamaldehyde (between 2 and 4%), lending more evidence to the hypothesis that essential oil biological activities may be shaped by the potential synergistic and antagonistic interactions among all these molecules and not only by major essential oil compounds [
