<p class="p">The results of repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant interaction (Wilksâ€™ lambda = 11.77;

 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> oviposition, resulting in significant (

 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 3; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) differences in the total number of eggs among the four combinations of treatments. When only females were exposed (i.e., exposed females or exposed couples) or when both females and males were exposed (i.e., exposed couples), the total number of laid eggs decreased dramatically in comparison with both the untreated couples and the couples where only males were treated. The two essential oils showed significantly (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 4.19; 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 1; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.04) different inhibiting effects on oviposition, and this difference was more evident in the oviposition of couples where only females were treated, as the decrease was more important for cinnamon compared to clove and untreated couples. Moreover, the differences between the effects of sublethal exposure to both essential oils were significantly (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 136.2; 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 2; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) higher during the first 3 days of the oviposition period.
