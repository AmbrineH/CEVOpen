<p class="p">The instantaneous rate of population increase (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) essential oils significantly reduced grain loss when applied as a contact treatment (

 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> insects in the absence of essential oils, to less than 6%, when the bean was treated with clove and cinnamon essential oils.
