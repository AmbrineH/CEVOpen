<p class="p">The original population of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> was field-collected from small farms in the Viçosa region (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) during the year 2015, and the population was maintained on pest- and insecticide-free cowpea beans under laboratory conditions (27 ± 2°C, 75 ± 5% RH, 12 h scotophase). The bean grains had a water content of 12% and were offered 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic>. The farm-owners gave permission to collect samples of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> from their fields and since 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> is not an endangered or protected species in Brazil, no specific permissions were required for such collection.
