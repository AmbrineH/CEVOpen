<p class="p">Newly emerged (&lt; 48 h old) groups of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> adult males and females were exposed separately to clove- and cinnamon-essential-oil-treated beans at the LD
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> values for clove (i.e., 48.6 μL kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> of beans) and for cinnamon (i.e., 106.2 μL kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> of beans) essential oils. After a 24-h exposure period, we paired 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> couples in four combinations (i.e., unexposed couple, exposed female, exposed male, and exposed couple) and allowed each couple to oviposit in 20 g of untreated beans. At 3-day intervals, the couples were moved to new 20-g bean masses, and this process was repeated for a total period of 9 days. The number of oviposited eggs was assessed under microscope after 3, 6 and 9 days. Twenty couples were used for each treatment combination.
