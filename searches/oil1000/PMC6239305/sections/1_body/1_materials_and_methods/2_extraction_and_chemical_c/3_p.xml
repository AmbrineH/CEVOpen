Data acquisition was made in full-scan mode, with a scanning range between 29 and 400 m/z. Experimental mass spectra were compared with known mass spectra (The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 14) Mass Spectra Library, 2017). The arithmetic index (AI) was calculated according to [
