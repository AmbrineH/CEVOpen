<p class="p">The components of the cinnamon and clove essential oils were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010, Shimadzu). The separation was done on a capillary column of fused silica (30 m × 0.22 mm) with stationary phase RTX5 (0.25-μm-thick film). The initial column temperature was 60°C for 2 min, followed by increase of 3°C min
