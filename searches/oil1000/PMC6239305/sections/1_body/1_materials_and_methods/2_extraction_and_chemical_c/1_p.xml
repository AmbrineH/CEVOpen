 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Briefly, the primary material was ground and sieved to obtain a fine powder (less than 1 mm) that was extracted at room temperature by constant percolation with hexane, followed by hydrodistillation for 6 h. Then, the distillate was extracted twice with dichloromethane and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The distilled oils were stored in airtight screw-capped vials at -10Â°C until use.
