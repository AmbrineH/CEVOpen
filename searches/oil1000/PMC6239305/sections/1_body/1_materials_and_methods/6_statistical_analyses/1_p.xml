<p class="p">Dose-mortality data were subjected to probit analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], and 95% confidence intervals for toxicity ratios were estimated following [
 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]; the values were considered significant if the range did not include the value 1. Regression analyses were performed to detect trends in cumulative and average emergence that resulted in each treatment over time. Regression analysis was performed using the curve-fitting procedure of Sigma Plot 12.0. The regression model was chosen based on parsimony, lower standard errors, and steep increases in R

The regression models for each treatment were considered different from each other if the confidence limits of their parameters did not overlap. We also conducted linear regression to assess the effects of increasing lethal exposure to essential oils on the

The assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were tested for all parameters, and no data transformations were necessary (PROC UNIVARIATE, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
