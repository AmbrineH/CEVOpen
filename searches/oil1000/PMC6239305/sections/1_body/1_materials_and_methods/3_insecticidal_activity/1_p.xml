<p class="p">We conducted dose-mortality bioassays to determine the lethal doses of the cinnamon and clove essential oils to adult 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic>. These bioassays followed procedures previously described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0207618.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Briefly, each essential oil was pure (i.e., without diluents) and was applied using a 25-μL microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) to 50 g of beans that were placed in 0.8-L glass jars. After the application, the jars were manually shaken for 60 s to ensure a complete distribution of the essential oils. Twenty unsexed 1-2-day-old 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maculatus</italic> adults were placed in each jar, and the jars were sealed with a fine porous cloth to allow ventilation; jars were kept under controlled conditions (27 ± 2°C, 75 ± 5% relative humidity, 12 h scotophase). The insect mortality was recorded after a 24-h exposure period. Insects were considered dead if they did not respond to fine paintbrush stimuli (i.e, two subsequent touches in 2 min intervals). Five doses of each essential oil were tested in the bioassays (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamon</italic>: 20, 60, 120, 160 and 200 μl kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. 
 <italic class="italic">Clove</italic>: 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 μl kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). Five replications were used per dose, and the control treatment did not receive any oil application. As a positive control, we used the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin (25 g L
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>; EC; Bayer Crop Science, SP, Brazil) diluted in distilled water to obtain the desired doses (e.g., 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104 μl a.i kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). The application and the conditions of bioassays were similar to those described for the essential oils.
