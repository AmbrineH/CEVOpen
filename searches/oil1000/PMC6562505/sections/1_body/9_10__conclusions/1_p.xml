<p class="p">Whole microalgal biomass and extracted high-value co-products are currently used in nutraceuticals and as ingredients in functional foods. It is widely recognized that compounds from microalgal extracts have greater biological and economical value than dried biomass. Additionally, purified compounds are preferable given that there are many undefined biochemicals, potential toxins, and heavy metals in whole microalgal biomass that could be unsafe for consumption and cause serious health conditions. Moreover, literature is needed to inform consumers about the content and acceptability of microalgal products.</p>
