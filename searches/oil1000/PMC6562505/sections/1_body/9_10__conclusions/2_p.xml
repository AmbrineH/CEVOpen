<p class="p">The supply of high-value algal products is challenged by the overall costs of production, including cultivation systems and maintenance, limited culture productivity, and the biorefining processes. While open ponds are the most economical choice for large-scale cultivation, they are more prone to contamination, thus closed PBRs are preferred if the selected strains synthesize valuable products that can justify the cost of the system. Harvesting and refining the biomass can also be very expensive, and the costs are largely dependent on the selected processes. Traditional methods for the extraction of high-value metabolites often rely on the use of organic solvents, and residual solvents in the products can compromise health. Thus, greener technologies, like supercritical fluid extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis, are presented as emerging techniques for the isolation of high-value algal products.</p>
