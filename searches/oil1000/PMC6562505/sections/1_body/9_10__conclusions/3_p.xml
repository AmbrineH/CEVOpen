<p class="p">Despite the challenges of large-scale cultivation, there is a clear demand for microalgal ingredients in foods, supplements, and potential pharmaceuticals. However, much more research is needed in this field to characterize the biochemical content of candidate microalgae to fully understand their benefits and possible concerns. Research on microalgal protein hydrolysates and purified peptides have demonstrated potential as antioxidants and antihypertensive compounds. Furthermore, given that only a few production strains of microalgae have been investigated (out of more than hundreds of thousands of predicted strains), there are immense opportunities for the discovery of novel bioactive metabolites, including the identification of compounds with potential antimicrobial, antifungal, antitumorigenic, and related activities.</p>
