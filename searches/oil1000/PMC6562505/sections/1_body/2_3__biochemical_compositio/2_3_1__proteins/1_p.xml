<p class="p">Proteins play an important role in the structure and metabolism of microalgal cells. They are an integral component of the membrane and light-harvesting complex, including numerous catalytic enzymes involved in photosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B57-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The protein content of many microalgal species can compete, quantitatively and qualitatively, with conventional protein sources [

 <xref rid="B59-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In terms of quantity, several species of microalgae are reported to possess very high concentrations of protein; this can range from 42% to over 70% in certain cyanobacteria [

 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In terms of quality, microalgae contain all of the essential amino acids that mammals are unable to synthesize. Moreover, the amino acid profiles are well-balanced and similar to high-quality protein sources, such as lactoglobulin, egg albumin, and soy [
 <xref rid="B57-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The application of microalgal proteins has been limited in foods thus far. This is mainly due to the presence of non-protein components (e.g., chlorophyll) that can affect the color and taste of the microalgae-based products [
 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Moreover, the rigid cell wall of some strains, mainly green microalgae (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Tetraselmis</italic>), can lower the extraction efficiency of intracellular proteins and whole biomass applications can result in low digestibility in humans (see later) [
