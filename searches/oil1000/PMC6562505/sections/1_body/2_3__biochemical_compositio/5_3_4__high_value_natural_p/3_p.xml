<p class="p">Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from microalgae are also considered among the major commercial high-value products with an estimated market value of $140 USD/kg [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The interest in fatty acids from microalgae is mainly attributed to their lower levels of contamination (e.g., methyl mercury, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls) when compared to fish oils [
