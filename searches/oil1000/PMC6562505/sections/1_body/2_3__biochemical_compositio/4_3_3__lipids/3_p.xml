<p class="p">The lipid content of many microalgal species is well documented, and this fraction can represent anywhere from 20% to 50% of the dry biomass (w/w). However, other values ranging from 1% to 70% have also been reported [
 <xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The production of lipids depends on the microalgal species, and the synthesis of different types of lipids is greatly affected by cultivation conditions, i.e., growth phase, nutrient availability, salinity, light intensity, temperature, and pH [

It is well known that the intracellular lipid content increases significantly during nitrogen limitation, and cultures in the stationary phase have been shown to double their neutral lipid content and synthesize polysaccharides at the expense of proteins [
