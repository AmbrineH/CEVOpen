<p class="p">Lipids provide the structural components of plasma membranes and neutral lipid bodies function as energy reservoirs secondary to polysaccharide stores. The lipid fraction of microalgae is mainly composed of (i) neutral lipids that include acylglycerols, free fatty acids, and carotenoids (e.g., Î²-carotene), and (ii) polar lipids, such as various phospholipids and galactolipids. Generally speaking, most microalgae are rich in polar lipids in the exponential phase of growth, and they accumulate triacylglycerols under stress conditions, which is typically during the stationary phase when nutrients are limited [

 <xref rid="B72-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The fatty acid profile of microalgae is generally characterized by a mixture of C16 and C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as well as longer carbon-chain lengths, including many omega fatty acids. Saturated fats are usually stored in neutral lipid bodies, whereas unsaturated fatty acids are mostly associated with polar lipids in the various membranes that serve to maintain membrane fluidity under varying cultivation conditions [
