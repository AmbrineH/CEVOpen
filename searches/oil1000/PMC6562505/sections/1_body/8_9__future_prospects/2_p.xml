<p class="p">There has been a growing demand for functional foods and nutraceuticals with targeted health benefits. In this context, the use of protein hydrolysates and bioactive peptides has gained interest for the prevention of illness and the improvement of symptoms from several diseases. Available studies on peptides of microalgal origin, although not very abundant, have provided evidence of promising in vitro biological properties. However, more in vivo and clinical trials are needed to determine the bioavailability of peptides after oral administration, especially since loss of bioactivity may occur due to hydrolysis and/or absorption of peptides in the gastrointestinal tract. In order to maintain the bioactivity of peptides, several strategies are being used, such as microencapsulation, nanoencapsulation, or chemical modification. A better understanding of the structureâ€“activity relationship using bioinformatics should enable the development of peptides with an enhanced bioactivity and help to predict non-desirable effects, such as hemolysis.</p>
