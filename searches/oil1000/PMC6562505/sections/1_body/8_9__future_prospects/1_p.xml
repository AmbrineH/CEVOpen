<p class="p">Within the context of global population growth and the availability of terrestrial food products, microalgae may present reliable and sustainable substitutes to commonly used commodities from animal or plant origins. However, to date, only a limited number of strains, mainly the cyanobacterium, 
 <italic class="italic">Arthrospira</italic>, and some green microalgae (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella, Dunaliella</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Haematococcus</italic>), have been utilized for the commercial production of a rather limited number of products. The shift from a niche market to the widespread use of algal products as food commodities will require extensive research and development. This would include the screening of new species or the improvement of existing strains by genetic engineering and modifications towards the development of microalgae with enhanced production of targeted metabolites. In the end, it is essential that microalgal cultivation and processing can be performed economically to ensure low-cost production that can compete with synthetic or biological production from other organisms.
