<p class="p">Hypertension is a major health concern worldwide. It is recognized to be the main cause of death and a leading risk factor of several chronic ailments, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and diabetes [

The regulation of blood pressure in the body involves a multitude of complex systems that are governed by ACE in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ACE catalyzes the conversion of inactive Angiotensin-I (Ag I) to Angiotensin-II (Ag II), a potent vasoconstrictor peptide that binds directly to Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor in the vascular smooth muscle cells to induce a potent hypertensive effect [
 <xref rid="B211-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>]. Furthermore, Ag II stimulates the secretion of aldosterone in the adrenal cortex, which promotes sodium and thus, water reabsorption in the distal tubules [
 <xref rid="B212-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. As a result, the volume of fluid in the body increases, implying an increase in blood pressure. On the other hand, Ag II stimulates the production of the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide in the polymorphonuclear leucocytes, which elicits an endothelium-dependent vasocontraction effect through the inactivation of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin [
