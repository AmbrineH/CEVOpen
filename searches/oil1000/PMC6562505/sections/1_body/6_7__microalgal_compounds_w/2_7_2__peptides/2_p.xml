<p class="p">Various sources of plant and animal proteins, mainly from dairy products and fish, have been used to produce ACE-inhibitory peptides (for a review, see Monroe and Fitzgerald [
 <xref rid="B221-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">221</xref>]), but the use of microalgal proteins has been very limited. Thus far, 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. ellipsiodea, Arthrospira platensis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Nannochloropsis oculata</italic> have been used to produce ACE-inhibitory peptides [
 <xref rid="B193-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">193</xref>]. Their effectiveness in lowering blood pressure has been reported extensively using both in vitro and animal studies. A purified peptide isolated from the pepsin hydrolysate of algae protein waste from 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, with the amino acid sequence Val-Glu-Cys-Tyr-Gly-Pro-Asn-Arg-Pro-Gln-Phe, was found to possess ACE-inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 29.6 μM [
 <xref rid="B222-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">222</xref>]. Two purified peptides, Gly-Met-Asn-Asn-Leu-Thr-Pro and Leu-Glu-Gln, from the cultured marine microalga, 
 <italic class="italic">Nannochloropsis oculata,</italic> showed ACE inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 123 μM and 173 μM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B119-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. Similarly, a potent ACE inhibitory peptide from the marine 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella ellipsoidea</italic> composed of only four amino acids, Val–Glu–Gly–Tyr, was reported to have ACE inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value = 128.4 μM) as well as an antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) when administrated orally [
