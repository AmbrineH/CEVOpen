<p class="p">Food-derived bioactive peptides have demonstrated their antihypertensive properties through the inhibition of enzymes involved in the regulation of mammalian blood pressure, e.g., ACE and renin [

 <xref rid="B218-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">218</xref>]. In addition, certain peptides have demonstrated the ability to enhance the endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway, leading to an increase in nitric oxide levels within the vascular walls, thus promoting vasodilation [
 <xref rid="B219-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">219</xref>]. Other peptides were reported to block the interactions between Ag II, a vasoconstrictor, and angiotensin receptors, which contributes to reducing blood pressure [
 <xref rid="B220-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>]. However, ACE-inhibitory activity is the most-studied metabolic pathway for the development of antihypertensive peptides.
