Moreover, it was suggested that substrates containing amino acids with cyclic or aromatic rings (e.g., Pro, Phe, Tyr, Trp) at their C-terminus and hydrophobic amino acids, especially those with aliphatic chains (e.g., Gly, Ile, Leu, Val), at their N-terminus were thought to enhance ACE-inhibition [

Despite evidence citing the importance of the C-terminal domain in the role of blood pressure regulation, the N-terminal domain was deemed the most important for ACE inhibition; the benefits consisted mainly of higher blockage of Angiotensin II production and better prevention of organ damage [
