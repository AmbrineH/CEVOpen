<p class="p">Despite the reported benefits, there are also numerous studies indicating that the ingestion of high amounts of 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Arthrospira</italic> may result in severe side effects. For example, the excessive intake of 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> was documented as causing allergies, nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal problems [
 <xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Some of these effects were reported with the 2016 recall of Soylent products that contained 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> algal flour as an ingredient. In other cases, 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> was found to induce acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, which can cause renal failure [

 <italic class="italic">Arthrospira</italic>, possible side effects included diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [

 <italic class="italic">Arthrospira</italic> biomass may contain significant amounts of heavy metals (e.g., mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and lead) or toxins, like microcystins, from co-occurring cyanobacteria, wherein prolonged consumption of
