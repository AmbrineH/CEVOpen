<p class="p">The potentially serious side effects of commercially-accepted microalgae, like 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Arthrospira</italic>, have raised serious doubts about the suitability of other strains of microalgae for human consumption [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Moreover, there are many more bioactive compounds yet to be discovered. Thus, there is an immediate need to detect potentially harmful metabolites, as well as to develop methods to extract targeted compounds from microalgae instead of using the whole biomass.
