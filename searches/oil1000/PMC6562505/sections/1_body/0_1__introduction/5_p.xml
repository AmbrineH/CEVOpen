Recent economic viability studies have shown that, due to limited biomass productivity and the costs of commercial algal production, the production of biofuels is not cost-effective unless the process is coupled with the commercialization of higher-value co-products [
 <xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. By comparison, the use of microalgae biomass for the development of products with health benefits, such as nutraceuticals and functional foods, is a rapidly growing market [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. For example, the worldwide carotenoid market is expected to increase from $1.24 billion USD in 2016 to more than $1.53 billion USD by 2021 [
