<p class="p">The pigments found in the algae are diagnostic for each major group [
 <xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll-a, -d, and -f, as well as the phycobiliproteins, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, and phycoerythrin. Glaucophytes contain chlorophyll-a and harvest light via phycobiliproteins. The Chlorophyta contain chlorophyll-a and -b, as well as a suite of carotenoids, including Î²-carotene and various xanthophylls (e.g., astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, etc.). The primary pigments of the Rhodophyte algae are phycoerythrin and phycocyanin, which can mask chlorophyll-a. There are no accessory chlorophylls; although, red algae do produce a broad spectrum of carotenes and xanthophyll light-harvesting pigments.
