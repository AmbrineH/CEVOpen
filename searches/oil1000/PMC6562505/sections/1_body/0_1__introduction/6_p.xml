<p class="p">A lot of funding has been invested over the last few decades to screen microalgal bioactive metabolites [
 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Several bioactive compounds have been discovered and purified from marine microalgae, including sulfated polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], marennine [
 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], various carotenoids (e.g., astaxanthin, fucoxanthin, Î²-carotene [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]), omega-3 fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Some of these metabolites have demonstrated biological activities, including potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Thus, microalgae and microalgae-derived compounds have great potential as supplements in the human diet for the prevention, management, and treatment of physiological aberrations, in addition to providing sustainable natural resources in lieu of synthetic dietary supplements [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, there are emergent biological and economic challenges associated with the large-scale cultivation of microalgae and the biorefinery process that must be addressed to ensure the sustainable production of high-value products with nutritional and health benefits.
