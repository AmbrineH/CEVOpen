<p class="p">Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae also synthesize numerous secondary metabolites, including potentially beneficial bioactives, such as antioxidants, as well as many compounds that are broadly characterized as toxins. These bioactive compounds are produced via the shikimic acid, mevalonic/non-mevalonic acid, and acetate pathways, e.g., anatoxins, brevetoxins, cylindrospermopsin, microcystins, and prymnesins, among many more (see [
 <xref rid="B6-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]). There are greater than 200 bioactive metabolites predicted from cyanobacteria [
 <xref rid="B7-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and thousands more are predicted from eukaryotic microalgae. However, there are very few assays or reference standards available for the detection of microalgal metabolites, indicating a major gap and a need for more research in this area. Examples of microalgal pigments and bioactive compounds discussed in this review are illustrated in
