<p class="p">The major groups of eukaryotic algae arose through multiple endosymbiotic events, resulting in broadly-distributed and highly-diverse lineages. The Glaucophyta, Rhodophyta, and Chlorophyta evolved via the primary endosymbiosis of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (Cyanophyta), which gave rise to the chloroplast. Secondary endosymbiosis of green algae led to two major groups, the Euglenophyta and photosynthetic Rhizaria, the Chlorarachniophyta [

Similarly, the secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga gave rise to the Cryptophyta, Heterokontophyta, Haptophyta, and Dinophyta. There are tertiary (and possibly quaternary) endosymbiotic events between the Dinophyta and Haptophyta, resulting in genomes greater than 500 Gbps [
