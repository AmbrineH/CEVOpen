<p class="p">Algae are a complex, polyphyletic assemblage of (mostly) photosynthetic organisms. Organisms in the algae include diverse micro- and macroscopic forms that are distributed across the tree of life, including eukaryotic and prokaryotic members [
 <xref rid="B1-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], making algae the most genetically-diverse set of organisms on the planet. While the phylogenetic relationships continue to be resolved among groups, algae can be broadly assigned to eleven major phyla: Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, Glaucophyta, Euglenophyta, Chlorarachniophyta, Charophyta, Cryptophyta, Haptophyta, Heterokontophyta, and Dinophyta.
