<p class="p">The extraction of polysaccharides is commonly performed using hot water [
 <xref rid="B137-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. This method has the advantage of simplicity and ease of scalability, but it is also time-consuming and has a low extraction efficiency [
 <xref rid="B138-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. Therefore, several novel extraction techniques have been applied to increase the yield of polysaccharides from cell culture. Among these novel techniques, microwave-, ultrasonic-, and enzyme-assisted extractions have recently gained increasing popularity. Microwave-assisted extraction was reported to have a shorter extraction time and higher extraction efficiency when compared to the conventional method [
 <xref rid="B139-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>]. However, this process can induce considerable changes in the chemical structure of polysaccharides and it has been shown to decrease the viscosity of starch solutions [
 <xref rid="B140-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. Ultrasonic-assisted extraction is another advanced method with higher extraction efficiency than the conventional hot water extraction [
 <xref rid="B141-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. Unlike microwave-assisted extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction did not significantly change the structure or molecular weight of polysaccharides, such as alginates and carrageenans [
