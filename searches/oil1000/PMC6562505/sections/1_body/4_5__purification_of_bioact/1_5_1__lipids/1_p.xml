<p class="p">Various extraction and purification methods are used to recover targeted bioactive compounds from microalgal biomass. The extraction of carotenoids, including carotenes and xanthophylls, typically involves biomass pretreatment steps (e.g., acid-base treatment, enzyme lysis, mechanical disruption) to breakdown the cell wall and membranes [

[
 <xref rid="B130-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>]). Finally, depending on the intended applications, additional purification steps (e.g., preparative chromatography) may be needed to concentrate and purify targeted fractions and remove contaminating residues.
