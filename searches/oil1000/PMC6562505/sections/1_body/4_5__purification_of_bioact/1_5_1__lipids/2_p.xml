Following extraction, additional processing steps, including fractional distillation or winterization, are used to separate PUFAs from the total lipids. However, this fraction is still not suitable for human consumption due to the presence of impurities, odor, taste, and cloudy appearance. Thus, further purification, i.e., filtration, bleaching, deodorization, polishing, and antioxidant addition, is needed to enhance the quality and shelf-life of PUFAs [
