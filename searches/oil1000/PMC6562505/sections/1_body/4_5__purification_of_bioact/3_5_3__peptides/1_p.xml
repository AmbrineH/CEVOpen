<p class="p">Numerous methods have been utilized to generate bioactive peptides from food proteins (e.g., chemical hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis). While fermentation systems are relatively low cost and easily scalable, this process has the disadvantage of low product yields because the microorganisms used for hydrolysis can also consume the released peptides or amino acids as substrate for their own growth [
