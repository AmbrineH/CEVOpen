<p class="p">Following the purification steps, peptides can be lyophilized for storage and applications. At the industrial scale of peptide manufacturing for pharmaceutical purposes, commercial-scale tray lyophilizers are used to increase batch volumes and provide better control over the freeze-drying parameters [

Despite recent advances in peptide purification, commercial-scale production is still challenged by costly manufacturing processes, which may introduce modifications in the structure of peptides, resulting in alterations or loss of bioactivity [
