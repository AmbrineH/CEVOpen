<p class="p">The success of enzymatic hydrolysis relies on several parameters, such as substrate specificity and hydrolysis conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, enzyme/substrate ratio, reaction time, etc.; see [
 <xref rid="B138-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>] for a review). Different strategies have been employed to enhance the yield of bioactive peptides from protein sources. One approach consists of the optimization of the proteolytic enzymes or the form of their use (single or in combination with other proteases) [
