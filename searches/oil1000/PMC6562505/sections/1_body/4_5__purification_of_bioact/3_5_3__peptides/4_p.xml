<p class="p">RP-HPLC is seen as the most powerful method for peptide purification. This technique uses a stationary phase and an aqueous mobile phase containing an organic solvent to rapidly separate peptides from a complex mixture [
 <xref rid="B153-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">153</xref>]. It is also easily scalable, especially since the development of dynamic axial compression (DAC) technology for preparative columns and the availability of excellent and relatively affordable reversed-phase adsorbent materials [
 <xref rid="B154-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>]. Membrane-based separation processes, such as ultrafiltration, are based on the fractionation of peptides according to their molecular weight. Molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) membranes are commonly employed and come in a wide range of sizes (e.g., 10, 5, 3, and 1 kDa MWCO) [
