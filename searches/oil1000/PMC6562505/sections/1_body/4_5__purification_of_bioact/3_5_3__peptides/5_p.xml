<p class="p">Other purification technologies exploit the chemical properties of the targeted peptides. Electromembrane filtration is more selective than membrane filtration because it enables the isolation of bioactive peptides according to both the charge and molecular weight, and it does not require the application of pressure [
 <xref rid="B155-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>]. More recently, affinity chromatography has been demonstrated to be very effective for the purification of bioactive peptides. The principle of this method consists of the formation of specific reversible complexes between the peptides being purified and an immobilized ligand. For example, immobilized copper or nickel on solid supports have been successfully used for the purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides [
