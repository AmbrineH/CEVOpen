<p class="p">The purification of bioactive peptides is necessary to enhance their concentration and bioactivity. Pre-treatment procedures are often applied to increase the extraction efficiency of bioactive peptides. These steps consist of concentrating proteins in mixtures by removing fats, carbohydrates, and other components from the biomass using ammonium sulphate (i.e., salting out) or solvent extraction [

Bioactive peptides can then be separated by a number of techniques according to their physicochemical parameters, e.g., size, hydrophobicity, and charge. Methods used for peptide isolation involve size-exclusion chromatography, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and ion-exchange chromatography.
