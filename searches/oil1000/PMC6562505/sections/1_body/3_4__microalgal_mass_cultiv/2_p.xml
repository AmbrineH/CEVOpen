<p class="p">While open ponds are deemed the only economically-viable cultivation system for producing lower-cost microalgal biomass, they are prone to emergent challenges, including lower productivity and biomass yields coupled with contamination [

As a rule, microalgae cultivated in open raceway ponds have much lower biomass productivities when compared to laboratory cultures and closed PBR systems.
