<p class="p">Paradoxically, in nature, large blooms of microalgae occur in complex environments with varying temperatures and nutrient conditions in highly-diverse biological communities. During a bloom, microalgal species temporarily outcompete others by rapidly dividing to reach dense cell concentrations, nearing the theoretical maximum level of growth rates (Î¼ &gt; 1) [

While it may be advantageous to mimic natural conditions and grow several strains of microalgae together (polyculture), commercial growth schemes have generally focused on the cultivation of one strain, unialgal monoculture [
