<p class="p">Algae synthesize many structurally-diverse carbohydrates with different types of glycosidic bonds. They can be classified as homo- and hetero-polysaccharides, sulfated polysaccharides (SPS), glyco-proteins/peptides, and pectins [

However, the relationship between the structures of polysaccharides and their biological functions are not well characterized because of the diversity and complexity of these polymers, namely the absence of monomeric and structural information [
