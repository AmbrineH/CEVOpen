<p class="p">Sulfated polysaccharides (SPS) from micro- and macro-algae are the most studied bioactive group of carbohydrates with anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B255-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">255</xref>]. These compounds can vary widely in their composition, i.e., types of monosaccharides, and their degree of sulfation. Several microalgal genera have been explored for their anti-inflammatory properties, including 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyridium</italic> (Rhodophyta), 
 <italic class="italic">Phaeodactylum</italic> (Heterokonts), and 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella</italic> (Chlorophyta). Guzman et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>] reported that crude polysaccharide extracts from 
 <italic class="italic">Chlorella stigmatophora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> demonstrated an anti-inflammatory response in a paw edema test. Of note, SPS from 
 <italic class="italic">P. tricornutum</italic> showed a direct stimulatory effect on the immune cells as shown with in vitro and in vivo assays. Similarly, Matsui et al. [
 <xref rid="B256-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">256</xref>] found that SPS from 
 <italic class="italic">Porphyridium</italic> inhibited the migration of leukocytes to the sites of inflammation in vitro, and inhibited the development of erythema in vivo.
