<p class="p">Besides microalgae, extensive research exists on the bioactive carbohydrates from seaweeds. Albuquerque et al. [
 <xref rid="B257-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">257</xref>] showed that heterofucan (sulfated L-fucose) from the brown algae, 
 <italic class="italic">Dictyota menstrualis</italic>, decreased inflammation by binding to the cell surface of polymorphonuclear cells, which completely inhibits the migration of the leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity of injured tissue in mice without the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In another study, Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B258-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">258</xref>], found that fucoidan (sulfated alpha-L-glucan) from 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia cava</italic> possessed inhibitory effects on the inducible NOS and COX-2 enzymes, which limited the production of NO and PGL2 in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Furthermore, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B259-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">259</xref>] reported that a fucoidan from 
 <italic class="italic">Lamanaria japonica</italic> reduced inflammation of damaged myocardium cells in rats by inactivating the secretion of the cytokines, HMGB1 and NF-ÎºB, two immunoproteins that are secreted during inflammatory responses and necrosis.
