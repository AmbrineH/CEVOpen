<p class="p">Results gathered from animal studies were in accordance with those of in vitro trials. Bennedsen et al. [
 <xref rid="B251-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">251</xref>] reported that astaxanthin from 
 <italic class="italic">H. pluvialis</italic> at 200 mg/kg reduced the levels of gastric inflammation in 
 <italic class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</italic>-infected mice following a treatment period of 10 days. The decrease in inflammation and the reduction of mucosa-related bacterial loads in the stomachs of infected mice were attributed to the action of astaxanthin to block the release of interferons, which boosts IL-4 release in splenocytes. A clinical study was also conducted on healthy young women, where it was demonstrated that the ingestion of 2 mg of astaxanthin daily for 8 weeks lowered the C-reactive protein in blood levels [
