<p class="p">Inflammation is a natural defense mechanism against pathogens. Although, chronic episodes of inflammation may cause renal, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases, and it is a leading cause of cancer, diabetes, and obesity [

There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress is the common factor underlying several inflammatory pathways, e.g., an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been suggested to be directly involved in Alzheimer’s disease. This is supported by the overproduction of ROS in early-stage patients that results in cleaving and misfolding of the amyloid precursor protein to amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ), which induces mitochondrial dysfunction and facilitates the formation of amyloid plaques [
 <xref rid="B230-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">230</xref>]. The disease pathology upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radical generation, which subsequently stimulates the production of Aβ peptide and other inflammatory pathways [

Additionally, ROS generated in brain tissues can modulate synaptic and non-synaptic communication between neurons that may result in neuroinflammation and cellular death, and subsequently in neurodegeneration and memory loss [
