<p class="p">Algal extracts have exhibited anti-inflammatory activities, notably through the inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids and the reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes [
 <xref rid="B237-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">237</xref>]. The mechanisms of action from these algal metabolites are very diverse and include the modulation of enzyme activities (e.g., phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), nitric oxide synthase (NOS)), regulation of cellular activities, and the interference of two major signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B238-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">238</xref>]. These include the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which play a key role in the production of various proinflammatory mediators. Algal compounds in extracts may also have anti-inflammatory properties combined with their antioxidant properties [
