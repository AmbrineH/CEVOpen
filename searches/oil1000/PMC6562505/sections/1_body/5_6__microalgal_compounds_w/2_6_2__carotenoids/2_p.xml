<p class="p">The antioxidant activity of carotenoids is attributed to the numerous conjugated double bonds in their structure or the presence of specific groups, such as epoxy, acetyl, allene (C=C=C), or acetylene (Câ‰¡C) groups [

 <xref rid="B173-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>]. These chemical groups act by scavenging free radicals and singlet oxygen from reactive species, thus neutralizing them into less harmful molecules [
 <xref rid="B174-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>]. In other cases, the antioxidant activity has been reported to be independent of structure. In such cases, carotenoids can activate the transcription factor, Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2), which triggers antioxidant gene expression in particular cells and tissues [
