They can also be introduced by pollution, unhealthy eating habits, smoking, lack of sleep, and irradiation by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, X-rays, or gamma rays. If ROS are not effectively neutralized by cellular constituents, they can stimulate free-radical chain reactions that are responsible for cell, tissue, and gene damage [
