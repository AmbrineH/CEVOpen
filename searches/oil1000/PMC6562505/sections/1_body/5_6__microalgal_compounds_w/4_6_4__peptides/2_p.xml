<p class="p">The antioxidant properties of bioactive peptides from microalgae have been examined in vitro, but also using cell-based assays. In vitro methods consist of assessing the capacity of bioactive peptides to scavenge reactive oxygen species and free radicals (e.g., 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals), to reduce ferric ions or inhibit lipid peroxidation [

It should be noted that the measurement of antioxidant activity in vitro has very little similarity to the physiological antioxidant capacity, which has made it challenging to conduct in vivo studies. As a result, it was proposed that the assessment of lipid and protein peroxidation as well as DNA damage are the most appropriate biomarkers to monitor changes in antioxidant activity in vivo [
