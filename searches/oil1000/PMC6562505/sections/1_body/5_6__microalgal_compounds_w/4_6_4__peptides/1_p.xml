<p class="p">Research in the area of bioactive peptides has increased significantly in the last decade. Natural peptides have reduced side effects when compared to synthetic supplements that may interfere with immune system activity and defense mechanisms, resulting in prooxidant effects [
 <xref rid="B192-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">192</xref>]. The global interest in bioactive peptides has been accelerated by their wide range of applications as potential treatments for a diverse array of pathological conditions, including hypertension, inflammation, diabetes, and oxidative stress [
