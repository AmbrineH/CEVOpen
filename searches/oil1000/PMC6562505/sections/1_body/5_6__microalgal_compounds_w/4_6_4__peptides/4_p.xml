<p class="p">The exact mechanisms of the antioxidant action of protein hydrolysates have not yet been clearly elucidated. However, it was recognized that the antioxidant activity of peptides was positively influenced by various characteristics of their chemical structure, namely small molecular weight, the composition and sequence of amino acids, the degree of hydrophobicity, the presence of an indole/imidazole/pyrrolidine ring, along with the steric structure at the C- and N-terminal region [

The use of quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship (QSAR) modeling of antioxidative peptides for scavenging radicals has provided additional evidence on the importance of the C-terminal region over the N-terminal for antioxidant potency [
