<p class="p">Generally, the use of polar solvents or a mixture of water and organic solvents allows for better extraction of broad groups of phenolics. While Hajimahmoodi et al. [

 <xref rid="B185-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>] found that hot water was the best solvent for the extraction of phenolic compounds, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B183-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>] found that hexane (a very non-polar solvent) had the highest extraction yield of phenolics. However, it is likely that intermediate solvent mixtures would yield many more phenolic compounds. Furthermore, little is known about the nature of polyphenolic compounds that are present in microalgae, since only a few articles have assessed the complete profile of phenolic compounds using chromatography methods [
 <xref rid="B185-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>,
 <xref rid="B190-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">190</xref>,
 <xref rid="B191-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">191</xref>]. Thus, further identification of phenolic compounds from microalgae is needed to better understand their roles as potential antioxidants.
