<p class="p">It has been demonstrated that the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds is highly dependent on their chemical structure, characterized by an aromatic ring bearing one or more hydroxyl substituents [
 <xref rid="B181-marinedrugs-17-00304" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>]. The hydroxyl groups contribute to the antioxidant activity through their metal-chelating capability as well as electron/hydrogen donation capacity, generating radical intermediates of greater chemical stability than the initial radicals [

Moreover, the combined action of hydrophobic benzenoid rings and hydroxyl groups makes phenolics capable of inhibiting different enzymes involved in ROS generation, such as lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenase, and xanthine oxidase [
