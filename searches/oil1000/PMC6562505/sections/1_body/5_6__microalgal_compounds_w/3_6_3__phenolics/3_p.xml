<p class="p">The contribution of phenolic compounds from microalgae to antioxidant activity is not very well established, like that of carotenoids. While some of the available research reported a positive correlation between the total antioxidant capacity and the whole phenolic fraction [

This has been attributed to several factors, such as the quality and the quantity of the phenolic compounds as well as the type of solvent used for the extraction process.
