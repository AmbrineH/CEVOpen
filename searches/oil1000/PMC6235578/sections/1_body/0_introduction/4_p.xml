<p class="p">In this protocol, we apply the automated 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> contact angle method developed by AlRatrout
 <italic class="italic"> et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref> that removes voxelization artefacts by applying Gaussian smoothing to the fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces. Then, a uniform curvature smoothing is applied only to the fluid-fluid interface, which is consistent with the capillary equilibrium. Hundreds of thousands of contact angle points are measured rapidly in combination with their 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>-, 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>-, and 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>-coordinates. The approach of AlRatrout

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref> has been applied to water-wet and mixed-wet quarry limestone samples saturated with decane and KI brine.
