<p class="p">In this study, we outline the steps followed to characterize the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> wettability of reservoir rocks at subsurface conditions. This includes drilling representative mini-samples, the core holder assembly, the flow apparatus and flow procedure, the imaging protocol, the image processing and segmentation, and finally running the automated contact angle code to generate contact angle distributions.
