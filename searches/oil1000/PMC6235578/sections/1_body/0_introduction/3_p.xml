 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref> improved the manual method by placing a circle at the fluid-fluid interface that intersects with a line placed at the fluid-rock interface on slices orthogonal to the three-phase contact line. This method has been applied to small sub-volumes extracted from three-dimensional images of quarry limestone rock saturated with decane and KI brine. Klise

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref> developed a method to quantify the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> contact angle automatically by fitting planes to the fluid-fluid interfaces and fluid-rock interfaces. The contact angle was determined between these planes. This method was applied to three-dimensional images of beads saturated with kerosene and brine. Both automated methods were applied to voxelized images that might introduce error, and in both methods, lines or planes were fitted at the fluid-fluid and fluid-rock interfaces and the contact angle was measured between them. Applying these two approaches on voxelized segmented images of complex rock geometry could lead to errors while also being time-consuming.
