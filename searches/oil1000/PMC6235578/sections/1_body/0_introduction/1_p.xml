<p class="p">Wettability (the contact angle between immiscible fluids at a solid surface) is one of the key properties that control fluid configurations and oil recovery in reservoir rocks. Wettability affects macroscopic flow properties including relative permeability and capillary pressure

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, and directly

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>. Both wettability indices and 
 <italic class="italic">ex situ</italic> contact angle measurements are limited and cannot characterize the mixed-wettability (or range of contact angle) that typically exist in hydrocarbon reservoirs. Moreover, they do not account for pore-scale rock properties, such as rock mineralogy, surface roughness, pore-geometry, and spatial heterogeneity, that have a direct impact on the fluid arrangement at the pore scale.
