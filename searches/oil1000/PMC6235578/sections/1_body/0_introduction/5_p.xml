 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> wettability characterization of complex carbonate reservoir rocks, extracted from a very large producing oil field located in the Middle East. The rocks were saturated with crude oil at subsurface conditions to reproduce the reservoir conditions upon discovery. It has been hypothesized that parts of the reservoir rock surfaces (with direct contact with crude oil) become oil-wet, while others (filled with initial formation brine) remain water-wet

However, the reservoir rock wettability is even more complex due to several factors controlling the degree of wettability alteration, including the surface roughness, the rock chemical heterogeneity, the crude oil composition, the brine composition and saturation, and the temperature and pressure. A recent study
