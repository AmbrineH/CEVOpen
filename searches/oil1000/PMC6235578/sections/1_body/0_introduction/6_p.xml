<p class="p">The main objective of this work is to provide a thorough protocol to characterize the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> wettability of reservoir rocks (mixed-wettability) at subsurface conditions. An accurate measurement of an 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> contact angle requires a good segmentation quality. Hence, a machine learning-based segmentation method known as Trainable WEKA Segmentation (TWS)
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref> was used to capture not only the amount of remaining oil but also the shape of the remaining oil ganglia, thus facilitating more accurate contact angle measurements. Recently, TWS has been used in a variety of applications, such as the segmentation of packed particle beds, liquids within textile fibers, and pores of tight reservoirs

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>. To image the remaining oil accurately at a high resolution and at subsurface conditions, a novel experimental apparatus was used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Mini-samples of rock were loaded into the center of a Hassler-type core holder
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref> made of carbon fiber. The use of a long and small diameter carbon fiber sleeve allows an X-ray source to be brought very close to the sample, hence increasing the X-ray flux and reducing the required exposure time, resulting in a better image quality in a shorter period of time. The carbon fiber sleeve is strong enough to handle high pressure and temperature conditions while remaining sufficiently transparent to X-rays
