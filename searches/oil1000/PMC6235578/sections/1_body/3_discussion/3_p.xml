<p class="p">This 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> wettability determination provides a thorough description of the wetting conditions of reservoir rocks compared to other conventional wettability measurement methods. It takes into account all important pore-scale rock parameters, such as rock surface roughness, rock chemical compositions, and pore size and geometry, that are not possible by wettability indices

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>. The 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> contact angle distribution measured using the automated method was relatively rapid. For example, the runtime for measuring the contact angle on any of the three sample images that contain 595 million voxels is approximately 2 h, using a single 2.2 GHz CPU processor.
