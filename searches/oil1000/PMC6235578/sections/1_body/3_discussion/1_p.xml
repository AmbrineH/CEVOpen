<p class="p">The most critical steps for an 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> wettability characterization at high pressure and temperature to be successful are as follows. 1) Generate a good image segmentation that is essential to obtain accurate contact angle measurements. 2) Avoid including large impermeable grains in the mini-samples that could seal off the flow, and large vugs resulting in a very fragile sample with non-representative porosity. 3) A well-controlled flow experiment with no leaks is important because mini-samples are very sensitive to the amount of injected fluid (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, one pore volume is about 0.1 mL). 4) Avoid the presence of air (as a fourth phase) in the pore space. 5) Maintain a temperature control of the sample during the whole flow experiment. 6) Avoid any interface relaxation during the scan acquisition by waiting for the system to reach equilibrium. 7) Use an appropriate center shift correction, which is necessary for the effective X-ray image reconstruction.
