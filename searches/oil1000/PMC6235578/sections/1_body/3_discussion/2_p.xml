<p class="p">The automated contact angle method is limited by the accuracy of the image segmentation because it is applied to segmented images only. Image segmentation depends largely on imaging quality that depends on the imaging protocol and the performance of the microtomography scanner. Furthermore, it is sensitive to the image reconstruction and the noise reduction filters, as well as the segmentation method such as the TWS
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref> or the seeded watershed method
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>. In this work, the TWS method provided more accurate contact angle measurements on raw X-ray images compared to those by a watershed method applied to filtered X-ray images (using noise reduction filters). The use of noise reduction filters makes the interface appear to be less oil-wet at some parts of the rock, due to the voxel averaging especially close to the three-phase contact line
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>. TWS can capture not only the amount of remaining oil saturation but also the shape of the remaining oil ganglia. This is especially the case for the remaining oil in the mixed-wet cases, in which oil is retained in the pore space as thin sheet-like structures, making it a challenge to be segmented based on gray-scale threshold values only.
