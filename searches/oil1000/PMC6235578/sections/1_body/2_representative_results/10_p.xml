 <bold class="bold">a</bold>) This is a three-dimensional segmented image showing brine in blue and oil in red, while rock is rendered transparent. (
 <bold class="bold">b</bold>) This panel shows extracted surfaces of the whole image. The oil/brine surfaces are shown in green, while the oil/rock surfaces are shown in red. (
 <bold class="bold">c</bold>) This panel shows the smoothed surfaces of the whole image. (
 <bold class="bold">d</bold>) This panel shows the three-phase contact line of the whole image. (
 <bold class="bold">e</bold>) This is an example of the smoothed surfaces of an oil ganglion highlighted by the black square. (
 <bold class="bold">f</bold>) This panel shows the three-phase contact line of the highlighted oil ganglion. (
