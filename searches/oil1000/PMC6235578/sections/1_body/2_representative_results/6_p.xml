 <bold class="bold">: Images demonstrating the drilling of representative mini-samples.</bold> (
 <bold class="bold">a</bold>) This cartoon illustrates the orthogonal marks with a good drilling location. 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> are the distances from the center of the core plug used to find where to drill. (
 <bold class="bold">b</bold>) This panel shows a dry X-ray three-dimensional image of the core plug (rendered semi-transparent) with a mini-sample (in dark gray). (
 <bold class="bold">c</bold>) This is a horizontal cross-sectional view of the core plug (scanned at 40 µm/voxel). The rock grains and pores are shown in gray and black, respectively. (
 <bold class="bold">d</bold>) This panel shows a horizontal cross-sectional view of the mini-sample (scanned at 5.5 µm/voxel). (
 <bold class="bold">e</bold>) This is a vertical cross-sectional view of the core plug showing the complex and heterogeneous pore sizes and geometries along with the location of the mini-sample indicated by the black box. (
 <bold class="bold">f</bold>) This is a magnified vertical cross-sectional view of the highlighted mini-sample shown in panel 
 <bold class="bold">e</bold> that was scanned at 5.5 µm/voxel.
