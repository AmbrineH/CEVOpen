<p class="p">For the 3 samples studied, the measured 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> distribution of the contact angle is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, with the oil recovery shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12" class="xref">Figure 12</xref> shows images of the remaining oil distributions for different wetting conditions at the end of the waterflooding. The mixed-wettability (or the range of the contact angle) was measured using the automated contact angle method
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>. The measured contact angle distributions are considered to be representative results if there is a good match between the contact angle points measured using the automated method from segmented images compared to the manually measured contact angles from raw X-ray images. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">Figure 10</xref> shows an example of a good match of a comparison measurement between the automated contact angles and the manual contact angles at the same locations for a sub-volume from mini-sample 1 (weakly water-wet).
