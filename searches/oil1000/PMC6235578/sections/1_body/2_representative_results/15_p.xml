 <bold class="bold">: The remaining oil morphology for different wetting conditions.</bold> (
 <bold class="bold">a</bold>) In sample 1 (weakly water-wet), the remaining oil was trapped at the center of the pores as disconnected ganglia with quasi-spherical shapes. Panels (
 <bold class="bold">b</bold>) and (
 <bold class="bold">c</bold>) show how in samples 2 and 3 (mixed-wet), the remaining oil was left in connected, thin sheet-like structures in small pores and crevices. The different colors represent disconnected oil ganglia.
