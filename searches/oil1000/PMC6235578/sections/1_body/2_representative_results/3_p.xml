<p class="p">The oil recovery was found to be a function of wettability, similar to earlier core-scale studies
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>. However, at that time, the oil recovery was shown as a function of the core-scale wettability index. Similar oil recovery behavior has been observed at the pore scale and was plotted as a function of the mean value of the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> contact angle distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>). The low oil recovery of sample 1 (weakly water-wet) was due to the trapping of oil in larger pore spaces. The brine percolated through the small pore corners, leaving the oil trapped as disconnected ganglia in the center of the pore spaces with quasi-spherical shapes (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>. In contrast, sample 2 (a mixed-wet case with more oil-wet surfaces) had oil layers that were largely connected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>
 <bold class="bold">b</bold>). These thin layers only allowed a slow oil production, leaving a high remaining oil saturation at the end of the waterflooding. The highest oil recovery was achieved in sample 3 (mixed-wet with a mean contact angle close to 90°) which was neither water-wet (so there is less trapping in large pores) nor strongly oil-wet (less oil is retained in small pore spaces)
