<p class="p">Three aging protocols were performed to treat the 3 samples and generate 3 wetting conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Aging the sample at a lower temperature (60 °C) and statically (no oil injection during the aging period) could result in a weakly water-wet condition, such as the distribution shown for sample 1 in blue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). On the other hand, aging the sample at a higher temperature (80 °C) and with partially dynamic aging (an oil injection during the aging period) could result in mixed-wet conditions with more oil-wet surfaces, like that of sample 2 shown in gray (
