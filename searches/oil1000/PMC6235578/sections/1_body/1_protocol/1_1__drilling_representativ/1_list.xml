  <p class="p">To acquire high-resolution scans, drill mini-samples (
   <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, with a diameter of 5 mm and a length of 15 - 30 mm). Firstly, label the core plug with 2 reference marks orthogonal to each other as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Then, acquire a full field-of-view (FFOV) scan of the core plug with a voxel size of 40 µm/voxel to visualize the internal distribution of pores and grains.

 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Identify and label good drilling locations carefully: these avoid large vugs or mineral grains. Use a data visualization and analysis software (
   <bold class="bold">Table of Materials</bold>) to visualize the three-dimensional image of the rock as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Open a two-dimensional slice of the rock dry image and identify good drilling locations while moving the slice from the top to the base of the rock.

 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Use a stainless-steel drilling bit to drill the mini-samples while using running water as a cooling fluid. Extract the fragile mini-samples carefully, using a thin chisel (
   <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, a small flat head screwdriver) to remove the mini-samples from their base. Make both ends of the mini-samples flat to facilitate good contact with the flow end pieces.

 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Measure the dimensions of the mini-samples accurately using a caliper. Use the measured dimensions to calculate the bulk volume. Multiply the measured bulk volume by the measured helium porosity to find the pore volume.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">To measure the helium porosity of the mini-samples, use a gas pycnometer. First, use the gas pycnometer to measure the grain density (kg/m
   <sup class="sup">3</sup>) of the dry rock sample. Divide the mass (kg) of the dry sample by the measured grain density (kg/m
   <sup class="sup">3</sup>) to obtain the grain volume (m
   <sup class="sup">3</sup>). Subtract the grain volume from the bulk volume calculated in step 1.4 and, finally, divide the difference by the bulk volume to obtain the total porosity (fraction).

 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Scan the drilled mini-samples at a higher resolution (
   <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, 5.5 µm/voxel) using an X-ray microtomography scanner to assess the internal pore structure. Refer to step 4 for more details on how this is done. NOTE: Drilling mini-samples involves moving mechanical parts. So, wear complete personal protective equipment (PPE) and take appropriate precautions while drilling.
