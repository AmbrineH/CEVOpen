<p class="p">All the samples were able to promote cell migration/proliferation in the gaps at least as the GM. In particular, cell substrates put in contact with NLC o/e, based on olive oil and loaded with eucalyptus oil, containing 5% w/w pull, showed a complete gap closure within 48 h after insert removal and a cell concentration higher than that of standard growth condition (control, GM). This nanosystem, therefore, demonstrated to be more effective in promoting wound healing in vitro.</p>
