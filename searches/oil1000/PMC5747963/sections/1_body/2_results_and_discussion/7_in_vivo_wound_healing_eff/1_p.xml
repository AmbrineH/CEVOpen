 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-13-175" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> reports the profiles of wound area (cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) as function of time. All the wounds treated with NLC o/e, as either nanoparticle suspension or nanoparticle suspension containing 5% w/w pull, and with saline solution (control) showed similar lesion area vs time profiles. After 4 days of treatment, NLC o/e suspension showed a significantly lower lesion area (not significantly greater than time 0) with respect to NLC o/e containing pull and saline solution, which were characterized by significantly greater dimensions than time 0 (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.05). At the 7th and 10th day of treatment both the lesions treated with NLC o/e, as either nanoparticle suspension or as nanoparticle suspension containing pull, presented dimensions not significantly different from each other and significantly lower than the lesion treated with saline solution (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.05). At the 15th day of treatment NLC o/e suspension presented the highest lesion reduction (one-way ANOVA, multiple range test 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.05) indicating the capability of these nanoparticles to speed up tissue repairing. Given the high variability of results, such a difference could not be observed at 18th day of treatment.
