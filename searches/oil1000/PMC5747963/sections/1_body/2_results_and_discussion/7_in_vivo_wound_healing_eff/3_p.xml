 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-13-175" class="xref">Figure 8A</xref>), a large part of epidermis was replaced by an eosinophil necrotic tissue (asterisk), and in the peripheral regions of the lesion, epidermis (bracket) was visible. In the underlying dermal connective tissue, an abundant granulation tissue (arrow) was present; moreover, collagen fibers were dispersed and not yet organized in large bundles, typical of the reticular layer of the dermis. There was no evidence of skin appendages (hair follicles and glands), while there were numerous vacuoles of different size (black star), delimited by a wall consisting of a monolayer of flattened cells (endothelium), probably corresponding to dilated vessels.
