<p class="p">Wound repair is one of the most complex physiologic processes, involving a multitude of different cell types, the contribution of which is tightly regulated over time. The breakdown of such a complex path could result in wound healing failure, leading to nonhealing wounds. The typical path of wound repair includes overlapping stages of inflammation, new tissue generation, and subsequent remodeling of neoformed tissue. These stages take place over dramatically different timescales, lasting from minutes (initial clotting and coagulation) to several months or even years.
