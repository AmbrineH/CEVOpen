<p class="p">The effect of microbial burden on healing of chronic wound is not completely understood and it is probably underestimated.
 <xref rid="b2-ijn-13-175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref> The presence of a biofilm was indicated as a critical factor and a correlation between depth and duration of the lesion and the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus</italic> strains was demonstrated.
