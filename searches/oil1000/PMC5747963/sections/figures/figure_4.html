 <p> Proliferation (% viability) for all the nanosystems developed loaded with eucalyptus or rosemary oils. Notes: Nanoparticle suspensions and nanoparticle suspensions containing 5% w/w pullulan at 1/100 dilution were tested. GM was used as comparison (positive control) (mean value Â± SD; n=8). Abbreviations: GM, growth medium; SLN, solid lipid nanoparticles; NLC, nano-structured lipid carriers; e, eucalyptus oil; r, rosemary oil; o, olive oil; s, sesame oil. </p>
