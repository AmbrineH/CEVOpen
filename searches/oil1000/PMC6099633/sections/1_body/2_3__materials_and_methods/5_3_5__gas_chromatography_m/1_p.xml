 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> aerial parts was accomplished with a Hewlett–Packard 5890 Series II instrument equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness), working with the following program: 60° for 10 min, increase of 2 °C/min up to 280 °C; injector and detector temperatures, 270 °C and 300 °C, respectively; carrier gas nitogen 1.0 mL/min; detector dual FID, split ratio 1:30; injection of 0.5 μL. GC-MS analysis of the essential oil of

 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> aerial parts was performed with a Agilent 6890N (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) gas chromatograph connected to Agilent 5973N mass selective detector at 70 eV ionization energy, equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (5% diphenyl and 95% dimethylpolysyloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Oven temperature was programmed as from 60 °C to 180 °C at 10 °C/min, remaining at 180 °C for 1 min, and then ramped up by 20 °C/min to 280 °C, and held there for 15 min. The injector temperature was held at 270 °C. The samples (1 μL, 1% acetone solution) were instilled, with a split ratio of 1:10. Spectra were scanned over the range 20 to 550

Further identification was made by comparison of their mass spectra with those of samples stored in NIST 05 (Standard Reference Data, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and Wiley 275 libraries (Wiley, New York, NY, USA), or with mass spectra from the literature [
