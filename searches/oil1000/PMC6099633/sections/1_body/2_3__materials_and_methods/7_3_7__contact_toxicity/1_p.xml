<p class="p">The contact toxicity of the essential oil and its isolated constituents against maize weevils (
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic>) adults was measured using a topical application method, as described by Liu and Ho [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Range-finding studies were run to determine the appropriate testing concentrations. A serial dilution of the essential oil/compounds (six concentrations, 2.0–30.0%, 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) was prepared in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. Aliquots of 0.5 μL of the dilutions were applied topically to the dorsal thorax of the weevils, using a Burkard Arnold microapplicator (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rickmansworth, London, UK). Pyrethrum extract was used as a positive control. Controls were determined using 0.5 µL of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane per weevil. Ten insects were used for each concentration and control, and the experiment was replicated six times. Both treated and control insects were then transferred to glass vials (10 insects/vial) with culture media and kept in incubators at 29–30 °C and 70–80% relative humidity. Mortality recordings were taken after 24 h of exposure. Pyrethrum extract (25% pyrethrin I and pyrethrin II) was purchased from Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland.
