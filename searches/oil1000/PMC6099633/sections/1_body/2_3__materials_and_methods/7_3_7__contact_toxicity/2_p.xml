<p class="p">The contact toxicity of the essential oil/constituents against booklice (
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>) was measured by an impregnated filter paper method, as described by Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Range-finding studies were run to determine the appropriate testing concentrations. The essential oil and isolated constituents were diluted in acetone. The filter paper with a diameter of 3.5 cm (Whatman) was treated with 150 μL of the solution. After treatment with solid glue (Glue Stick, Jong Ie Nara Co., Ltd., Hong Kong, China), the filter paper was placed in a Petri dish (3.5 cm in diameter) and 10 booklice were onto it using a hair brush. A plastic cover with holes was placed over it, and all the Petri dishes were kept in incubators at 27–29 °C and 70–80% relative humidity for 24 h. Acetone was used as the control, and pyrethrum extract was used as the positive control. Five concentrations and five replicates of each concentration were used in all treatments and controls. Mortality recordings were taken after 24 h of exposure.
