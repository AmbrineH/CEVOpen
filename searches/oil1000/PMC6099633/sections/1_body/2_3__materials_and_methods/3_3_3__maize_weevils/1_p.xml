 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic>) were obtained from laboratory cultures, and were maintained in the dark in incubators at 29–30 °C and 70–80% r.h. Maize weevils were reared on whole wheat at 12–13% moisture content in glass jars (diameter 85 mm, height 130 mm). Unsexed adult weevils used in all the experiments were about 2 weeks old.
