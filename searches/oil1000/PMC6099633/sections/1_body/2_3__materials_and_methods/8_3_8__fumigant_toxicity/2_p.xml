 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> essential oil. A filter paper strip (3.5 cm × 1.5 cm) was treated with 10 μL of an appropriate concentration of test essential oil/compound in acetone. The impregnated filter paper was then placed in the bottom cover of glass bottle of 250 mL. The insects, 10 adults in a small glass bottle (8 mL), were exposed for 24 h and each concentration with five replicates. All the treatments were replicated five times. Acetone was used as controls and dichlorvos was used as a positive control. The observed mortality data were corrected for control mortality using Abbott’s formula. A positive control, dichlorvos (99.9%) was purchased from Aladdin-reagent Company (Shanghai, China).
