<p class="p">The fumigant toxicity of the essential oil and isolates against 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> adults was recorded, as described by Liu and Ho [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Range-finding studies were run to determine appropriate testing concentrations. A serial dilution of the essential oil/pure compounds (2.0–40.0%, six concentrations) was prepared in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane. A Whatman filter paper (diameter 2.0 cm) was placed on the underside of the screw cap of a glass vial (diameter 2.5 cm, height 5.5 cm, volume 24 mL). Ten microliters of an appropriate concentration of the essential oil/compounds was added to the filter paper. The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 10 s before the cap was placed tightly on the glass vial (with 10 insects) to form a sealed chamber. Fluon (ICI America Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) was used inside each glass vial to prevent weevils from coming into contact with the treated filter paper. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that 10 s were sufficient for the evaporation of solvents. 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-Hexane was used as a control. Six replicates were used in all treatments and controls; they were incubated at 29–30 °C and 70–80% r.h. for 24 h, and the mortality was recorded.
