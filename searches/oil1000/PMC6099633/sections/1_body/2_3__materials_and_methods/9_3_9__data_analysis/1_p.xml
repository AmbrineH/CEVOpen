<p class="p">Mortality of insects was observed and the observed data were corrected for control mortality, using Abbottâ€™s formula. The results from all replicates were subjected to probit analysis, using the PriProbit Program V1.6.3 to determine LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Significant differences in LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> and LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> were based on nonoverlap of the 95% confidence intervals (FL).
