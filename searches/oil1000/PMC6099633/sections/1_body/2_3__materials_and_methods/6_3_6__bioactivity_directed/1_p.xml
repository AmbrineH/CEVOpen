<p class="p">The crude essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. riederi</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> (30 mL) was purified on a silica gel [Merck 9385 (Merck &amp;Co., Inc. Darmstadt, Germany), 1000 g] column (95 mm i.d., 900 mm length) by gradient elution with a mixture of solvents (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane:ethyl acetate = 100:0–0:100, 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>). Fractions (500 mL each) were collected and concentrated at 40 °C, and similar fractions according to thin layer chromatography (TLC) profiles were combined to yield 14 fractions. Based on contact bioassay, fractions (
 <bold class="bold">3</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">5</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">7</bold>, 
 <bold class="bold">9</bold> and 
 <bold class="bold">12</bold>) were further separated by preparative silica gel column chromatography (PTLC) to obtain five pure compounds; anisole (0.35 g), 1,8-cineole (0.42 g), geraniol (0.27 g), eugenol (0.21 g), and acetanisole (0.19 g).
