<p class="p">The yellow essential oil yield of

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>, and the density of the concentrated essential oil was determined to be 0.83 g/mL. A total of 40 components of the essential oil were identified, representing 96.01% of the total oil composition (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01200-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The principal compounds in 
 <italic class="italic">S. riederi</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> essential oil were acetanisole (15.43%), anisole (9.43%), 1,8-cineole (8.07%), geraniol (7.89%), eugenol (4.54%), caryophyllene oxide (4.47%), caryophyllene (4.21%), and linalool (4.07%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01200-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Monoterpenoids represented 19 of the 40 compounds, corresponding to 41.18% of the whole oil, while 15 of the 40 constituents were sesquiterpenoids (23.86% of the crude essential oil). This is the first documentation of the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. riederi</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> aerial parts. However, the results are quite different from several essential oils derived from Stachys species, which is also found in China. For examples, the major components identified in 
 <italic class="italic">S. lanata</italic> essential oil were α-thujone (25.9%), α-humulene (24.9%), β-caryophyllene (12.6%), and viridiflorol (10.5%) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The main compounds in the essential oil of S. palustris from Southern Italy were caryophyllene oxide (7.8%), hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (7.4%), hexadecanoic acid (6.8%), (

 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid (6.7%), (

 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic>-methoxyacetophenone (5.1%) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] while the sample collected from Dolje, Croatia contained 1-octen-3-ol (24.5%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-2-hexenal (16.3%), caryophyllene oxide (16.2%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (6.5%), and γ-muurolene (4.8%) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> was identified as α-pinene (21.4%), germacrene D (13.6%), β-pinene (12.3%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-caryophyllene (9.9%), γ-muurolene (6.4%), and δ-cadinene (4.3%) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. However, the most abundant compounds in the oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> from the inflorescences were germacrene D (55.2%), (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>)-β-farnesene (9.1%), and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-tetracosane (6.9%), whilst germacrene D (31.7%), 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-tetracosane (7.8%) and mint sulphide (6.4%) were the main compounds in the oil from the leaves [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sylvatica</italic> from Iran contained β-caryophyllene (19.64%), δ-cadinene (13.41%), spathulenol (12.51%), δ-3-carene (7.38%), and α-copaene (6.38%) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The above findings suggest great variations in chemical composition in the essential oils of the 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys</italic> species.
