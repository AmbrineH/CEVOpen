<p class="p">The essential oil of

 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> adults and 
 <italic class="italic">L. bostrychophila</italic>, with LC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 85.8 μg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) showed stronger contact toxicity (no overlap in 95% fiducial limit) than the essential oil against booklice, while acetanisole and geraniol (LC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1076.3 μg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) possessed weaker contact toxicity (no overlap in 95% fiducial limit) than the essential oil against booklice. However, anisole did not show any contact toxicity against booklice at current tested concentrations. Similarly, eugenol and 1,8-cineole (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 8.1, 15.8 μg/adult, respectively) showed stronger contact toxicity (no overlap in 95% fiducial limit) than the essential oil against maize weevils, while geraniol (LC

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 34.0 μg/adult) possessed weaker contact toxicity (no overlap in 95% fiducial limit) than the essential oil against
