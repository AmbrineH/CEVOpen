It seems that this medicinal herb is quite safe for human consumption, because it has been used as a medicinal herb for hundreds of years. However, no experimental data about the safety of this herb is available so far. Thus, for the practical application of the essential oil as novel fumigant/insecticide, further studies on its safety to humans, and on the development of formulations, are necessary to improve efficacy and stability, and to reduce cost. Moreover, post-application temperature plays a very important role in the compoundâ€™s insecticidal efficacy [

 <italic class="italic">S. riederi</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> aerial parts is not high (only 0.111%), for the mass usage of the essential oils as novel botanical insecticide/fumigant, further studies on the effects of increasing of the content of the oil are required.
