<p class="p">Among five isolates, acetanisole was not found to have fumigant toxicity against the two grain storage insects at the tested concentrations (

 <xref rid="molecules-23-01200-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Eugenol and anisole (LC

 <xref rid="molecules-23-01200-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). 1,8-Cineole and geraniol (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1.1 and 1.9 mg/L, respectively) showed weaker fumigant toxicity than the oil against booklice (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01200-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Thus, it seems that fumigant toxicity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. riederi</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> against booklice may be mainly attributed to eugenol and anisole. Similarly, only 1,8-cineole (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 5.9 mg/L) showed stronger fumigant toxicity (no overlap in 95% fiducial limit) than that of the oil against 
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01200-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Anisole and eugenol (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 14.8 and 15.9 mg/L, respectively) exhibited the same levels of fumigant toxicity as the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">S. riederi</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">japonica</italic> aerial parts against maize weevils (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-01200-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The essential oil is normally a mixture of tens to hundreds of individual compounds. Active (insecticidal) ingredients in the essential oil may have different mechanisms of action against insects/mites. Synergistic or antagonistic effects of those active ingredients have been observed in several reports [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-01200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] determined the efficacy of 30 aromatic compounds and their mutual binary combinations for acute toxicity against the larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Spodoptera littoralis</italic>. In total, 435 binary combinations were tested, of which 135 combinations showed a significant synergic effect, while 150 combinations showed a significant antagonistic effect on the mortality of 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic>. Thus, further studies may need to observe possible synergistic or antagonistic effects of the isolates. On the basis of a literature survey, the three constituents, 1,8-cineole, geraniol, and eugenol, have been shown to possess insecticidal and acaricidal activities, as well as repellency against several insects/mites, including maize weevils (
 <italic class="italic">S. zeamais</italic>) and booklice (
