<p class="p">The extracted PPEO was filtered through a 0.45 μm microporous organic membrane. Volatile compounds were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A GC coupled to an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA). The components of PPEO were identified using HP-5Ms phenylmethylsiloxane capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies, J &amp; W Scientific Products, Folsom, CA, USA) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Injector temperature was 250 °C. The split ratio was 10:1. The temperature program was 45 °C (hold for 1 min), increase at 10 °C/min to 165 °C (hold for 2 min), increase at 1.5 °C/min to 180 °C (hold for 2 min), and then increase at 10 °C/min to 250 °C (hold for 2 min). The temperature of both injector and detector was set at 250 °C. Mass spectra were scanned from 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 35–350 amu. The electron impact ionization energy was 70 eV. Identification of compounds detected by GC/MS analysis was performed by comparing mass spectra and retention indices (RIs) with published data obtained under similar conditions, as well as by comparing their mass spectra with the MS library of Wiley 7.0 and Nist 05 [
