<p class="p">Cell viability was evaluated by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according to the method of Satooka et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The cell density was 7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/mL and the cells were seeded on 96-well cell culture plates at 100 μL per well. After 24 h of culture, the original culture solution was aspirated. Cells were exposed to various concentrations of PPEO or kojic acid (71 μg/mL), with 6 replicates for each concentration (500 μmol/L of kojic acid is equal to 71 μg/mL). After culture for another 24 h, 100 μL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT was added to each well, followed by inoculation for 4 h at 37 °C. The liquid was carefully aspirated from the well, and then 150 μL of DMSO was added to each well. After 10 min of shaking, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an M200 pro enzyme-labeled instrument (Tecan, Ltd.).
