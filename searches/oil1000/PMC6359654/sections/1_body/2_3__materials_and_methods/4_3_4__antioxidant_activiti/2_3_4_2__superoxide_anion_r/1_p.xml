<p class="p">The superoxide anion radical scavenging activity was measured as described by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The reaction mixture consisted of 4.5 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2) and 1 mL sample solution at different concentrations. The mixed solution was pre-incubated at 25 Â°C for 10 min, and then initiated by the addition of 0.45 mL 2.5 mM pyrogallol. After vigorous shaking for 5 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 8 mol/L HCl. The absorbance was read at 517 nm.
