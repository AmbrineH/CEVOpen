<p class="p">The DPPH radical scavenging assay was performed according to Boskou et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The sample PPEO was prepared with different concentrations with absolute ethanol. A mixture of 50 μL sample and 150 μL 0.1 mmol/L DPPH free radical ethanol solution was taken and placed in a 96-well plate. After vigorous shaking, the mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance at 517 nm was measured. Pomelo peel essential oil was replaced with absolute ethanol to serve as the blank control, and BHT was used as positive control.
