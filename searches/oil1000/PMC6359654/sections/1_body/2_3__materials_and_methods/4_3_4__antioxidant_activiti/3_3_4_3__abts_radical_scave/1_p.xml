<p class="p">The ABTS radical scavenging assay was conducted following the method previously described by Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Diluted radical solution was prepared by mixing 7 mM ABTS and 2 mM K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>S
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">8</sub> in equal amounts, followed by reaction in the dark overnight at room temperature. The samples were prepared in different concentrations with ultrapure water. Aliquots of 10 μL of samples were mixed with 200 μL of the diluted radical solution in 96-well plate and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm after 5 min using an M200 pro enzyme-labeled instrument (Tecan, Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland). BHT was used as the positive control.
