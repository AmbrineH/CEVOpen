<p class="p">Fresh pomelo was picked and the white peel from the fresh pomelo peel was removed, and then the exocarp chopped in 1.5 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.2 cm sized pieces. Pomelo peel (100 g) was crushed and pressed twice with a cold hydraulic press (Model 6YL-190; Changbai Mountain Technology Limited company, Changchun, China) [

After filtering through a steel sieve (0.15 mm), saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution was added to the sample for the extraction of PPEO for 3 h. Then, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000×
