<p class="p">A sterilized coverslip was placed into each hole of the six-hole plate on an ultra-clean workbench. The cell suspension was added to each coverslip and placed in an incubator with a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration of 5% at 37 Â°C until cell fixation (2 h). After the addition of 2 mL culture medium, the culture was continued for about 6 h. The medium was decanted and the cells were washed for 5 min with PBS for 3 times. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and then paraformaldehyde was removed by PBS buffer washing. After the addition of appropriate amounts of Hoechst stain, the coverslips were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. The coverslips were then rinsed 3 times with PBS for 5 min each time, and the side with the cells was observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope [
