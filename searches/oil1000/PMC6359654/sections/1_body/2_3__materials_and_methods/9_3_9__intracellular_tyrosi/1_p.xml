After 24 h of culture, cells were exposed to various concentrations of PPEO (10–100 μg/mL) or kojic acid (71 μg/mL), and incubated for additional 48 h. The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer. The plates were frozen at −80 °C for 30 min. After thawing and mixing, the tyrosinase activity was measured by ELISA kit [
