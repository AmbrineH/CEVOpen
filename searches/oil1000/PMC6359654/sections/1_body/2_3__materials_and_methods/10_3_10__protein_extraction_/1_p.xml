<p class="p">Total protein was extracted from cells lysed by RIPA Lysis buffer with 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The amount of protein was measured by Micro BCA protein assay kit (Shanghai Yuye biotechnology Co., Ltd.). The samples were loaded on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were then placed in blocking solution and blocked at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with appropriate concentrations of specific antibodies, including rabbit monoclonal antibodies glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1:10000 dilution) and rabbit monoclonal antibodies TYR (1:1000 dilution). After five or six times of washing, the blots were then incubated with secondary antibody (HRP-Goat anti Rabbit). BandScan was used to analyze the integrated density of bands.</p>
