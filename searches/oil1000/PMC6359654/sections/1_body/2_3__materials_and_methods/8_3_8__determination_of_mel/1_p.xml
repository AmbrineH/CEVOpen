<p class="p">Melanin content was determined as described by Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. B16 cells were plated at a density of 7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well in a 6-well plate. The experimental group was added with 0.2 μmol/L α-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) to construct a cell model with high melanin expression. After 12 h of culture, cells were exposed to various concentrations of PPEO (10–100 μg/mL). Kojic acid at a concentration of 71 μg/mL was used as a positive control. After 48 h of culture, the supernatant was discarded and the cells were washed 3 times with PBS buffer. After the addition of 200 μmol/L NaOH solution (containing 10% DMSO) to each well, the cells were fully lysed at 80 °C for 1 h, and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm. The amount of protein was measured by Micro BCA protein assay kit (Shanghai Yuye biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). The melanin content was calculated by normalization to the total cellular protein (1 g of melanin/mg of protein) and reported as a percentage of the control.
