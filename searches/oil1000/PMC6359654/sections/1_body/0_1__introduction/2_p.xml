<p class="p">Oxidative stress can produce reactive oxygen such as superoxide (O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and hydroxyl radical (HO). These reactive oxygen species can disrupt the balance of normal metabolic activity in the human body and are associated with many chronic diseases such as aging, cancer, atherosclerosis, and inflammation [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. There has been extensive research on the antioxidant activities of plant EOs. Most current research on antioxidants is focused on citrus EOs. For example, the antioxidant properties of 34 kinds of citrus EOs have been tested. The results showed that most of the EOs have good inhibitory effects on 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH), which are significantly better than the effects of water-soluble vitamin E [
