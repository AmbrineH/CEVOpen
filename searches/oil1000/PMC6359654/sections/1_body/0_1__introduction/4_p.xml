<p class="p">In this study, we extracted PPEO from pomelo cv. Guan Xi by a cold pressing method and analyzed its main components using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The anti-oxidant activities were examined with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH); 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), and superoxide anion radical scavenging. Furthermore, based on the B16 melanoma cell system, the effect of PPEO on the viability and morphology of B16 cells and the production of melanin was evaluated. Finally, intracellular TYR activity assay and Western blot analysis were performed to validate the inhibitory effect of PPEO on TYR.</p>
