<p class="p">Melanin is a pigment widely distributed on the surface of skin, hair, retina, and adrenal medulla. It is synthesized from tyrosine under the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosinase (TYR) [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, excessive production and accumulation of melanin can cause pigmentation spots and skin discoloration such as chloasma, freckles, and age spots. Tyrosinase is associated with a variety of diseases and may be a key factor of dopamine neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson’s disease [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Besides, it is also a key rate-limiting enzyme in the initial reaction of melanin production. At present, the application of EOs as a natural enzyme inhibitor has become a research hotspot. Plant EOs have strong biological activities and great application potentials in biology and medicine [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Cinnamon EO and clove EO can inhibit the TYR activity in B16 cells by 37% and 10%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Lemon EO was observed to have significant inhibitory effects on TYR activity, and its major components were determined to be monoterpenoids and oxindoles [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], which are also the main components of pomelo EO. Hence, it can be speculated that pomelo EO might also have inhibitory effects on TYR activity. Mint leaf EO could reduce the synthesis rate of melanin in B16-F10 cells, and β-caryophyllene (main component) can also decrease melanin production by down-regulating the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor protein (MITF), tyrosinase-related protein-1 (Trp-1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (Trp-2), and TYR [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Aromatic or aliphatic compounds such as anisaldehyde and cuminaldehyde are effective TYR inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Citrus EOs contain a large amount of fatty aldehyde compounds, indicating their potential inhibitory activity against TYR. However, the current research on pomelo mostly focuses on the storage and preservation of fresh fruit and the extraction of pectin from the peel, while little research attention has been paid to the antioxidant and anti-melanogenic effects of pomelo peel EO (PPEO). Therefore, clarifying the effect of PPEO on melanin synthesis is of great significance for improving the high value-added utilization of PP and expanding its application in the health food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics fields.
