<p class="p">Pomelo, a citrus fruit belonging to the genus Rutaceae, is grown and consumed worldwide due to its unique flavor and high nutritional value [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In the production of pomelo juice, jam and other products, pomelo peel (PP) is a major by-product accounting for about 50% of the total weight of the fruit. However, most of the PP is disposed of in landfills, resulting in environmental pollution and loss of economic value [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Pomelo peel contains many natural chemical ingredients, making it a good source of valuable extracts. Compared with the peel of other fruits, PP has a higher concentration of essential oil (EO). Citrus EO is generally considered to be safe with a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic effects [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Due to its high content of active substances such as terpenes, sesquiterpene, aldehydes, ketones, and esters, pomelo EO has strong aromatic, antioxidant, bacteriostatic, and antiviral properties [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and thus can be used as a functional ingredient and premium fragrance in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, the high value-added utilization of PP has important research significance and economic prospects.
