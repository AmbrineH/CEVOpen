<p class="p">Our study is the first to extract essential oil from the peel of pomelo cv. Guan Xi by a cold pressing method and analyze its main components of limonene, β-myrcene, β-pinene, ocimene, and β-copaene. Our results reveal that PPEO has strong antioxidant activities against DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide anion radicals and the main active components responsible for the effect are terpenes. Besides, the effects of PPEO on the viability of B16 cells and the production of melanin were evaluated based on the B16 melanoma cell system. The results indicate that PPEO down-regulates the expression level of TYR in B16 cells, which inhibits the catalytic reaction of TYR and blocks the synthesis pathway of melanin; and it further reduces melanin production without affecting the cell viability. This study provides data support for expanding the potential application of essential oil from pomelo peel as a natural antioxidant in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Further research in vivo is needed to fully evaluate the potential anti-melanogenic effect of PPEO.</p>
