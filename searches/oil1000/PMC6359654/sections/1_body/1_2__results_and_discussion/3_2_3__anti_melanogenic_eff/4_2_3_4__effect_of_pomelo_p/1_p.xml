<p class="p">The expression of TYR protein was detected by Western blotting, and the intensity of protein expression was determined by the ratio of the target band to the internal reference band (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). PPEO down-regulated the expression level of TYR in B16 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with that in the blank control group, the TYR expression gradually decreased with increasing PPEO concentration. When the PPEO concentration was 50 Î¼g/mL, the TYR expression was 60.38% lower than that of the blank group and was close to that of the positive group (kojic acid). This result is consistent with the tyrosinase enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) test results.
