<p class="p">B16 cells are adherent and mostly fusiform cells with dendrites and relatively more divisions. They are tightly connected monolayers with high transparency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). The cells in the control group showed uniform fluorescence, clear cell boundaries, and normal dendritic morphology. When the concentration of PPEO was 10–50 μg/mL, the number of cell deaths was small, the cell boundary was clear, and the fluorescence was relatively uniform. However, at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, the number of cell deaths increased and the boundaries between cells became blurred, accompanied by the appearance of obvious fluorescent spots. At the same time, cells were dispersed and the dendrites were reduced. In the high-concentration PPEO group (100 μg/mL), the cells showed enhanced fluorescence, and were swollen and separated from each other, presenting a typical state of apoptosis in the cells.
