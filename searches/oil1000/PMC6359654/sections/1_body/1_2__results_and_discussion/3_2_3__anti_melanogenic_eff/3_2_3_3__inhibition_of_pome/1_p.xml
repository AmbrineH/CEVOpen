<p class="p">To determine the anti-melanogenic activity of PPEO, we evaluated its effect on TYR activity and melanin content in B16 melanoma cells. The B16 melanoma cells were treated with various concentrations of PPEO and then co-cultured for 72 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, PPEO dose-dependently inhibited TYR activity and melanin content. At a concentration of 50 μg/mL, melanin synthesis and TYR activity were inhibited by 48.28% and 64.54%, respectively, and the IC
