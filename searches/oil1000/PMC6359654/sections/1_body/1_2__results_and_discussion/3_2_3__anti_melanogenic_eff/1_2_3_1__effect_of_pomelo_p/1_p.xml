<p class="p">B16 melanoma cells were treated with different concentrations of PPEO for 24 h, and the viability of each group was detected by MTT assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). The survival rate of B16 cells treated with a low concentration of PPEO (5 μg/mL) was higher than 100%, indicating that low concentration of PPEO may facilitate the proliferation of B16 cells, which might be related to the active volatile components in PPEO [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The cell viability decreased significantly along with increasing PPEO concentration. When the concentration of PPEO was 150 μg/mL, the cell survival rate significantly decreased to 29.35% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The results show that at concentrations lower than 50 μg/mL, PPEO did not affect cell viability. However, high concentrations of PPEO (&gt;50 μg/mL) significantly inhibited cell viability.
