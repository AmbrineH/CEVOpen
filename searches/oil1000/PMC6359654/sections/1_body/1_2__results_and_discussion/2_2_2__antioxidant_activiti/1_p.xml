 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows the DPPH free radical scavenging rate, superoxide anion radical scavenging rate, and total antioxidant activity of PPEO. PPEO exhibited significant effects on the free radical scavenging rate in a concentration dependent manner. At a low concentration (5 mg/mL), PPEO had no significant effect on DPPH free radical scavenging (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>A). However, with increasing concentration, the DPPH free radical scavenging rate of PPEO reached 68.13% at 150 mg/mL, which was statistically significantly different from that of the control group (

 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of PPEO was 70.12 mg/mL. The positive control butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) showed good DPPH free radical scavenging ability at low concentrations. Superoxide anion free radicals can induce lipid peroxidation in the body, thereby accelerating the aging of human skin and even internal organs [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>B, when the concentration of PPEO was 0.2 mg/mL, the superoxide anion clearance rate was only 11.93% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). With increasing PPEO concentration, the clearance rate increased to 44.74% at 1.0 mg/mL (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). It seems that PPEO could effectively remove the superoxide anion radicals, but with a lower scavenging ability than L-ascorbic acid at the same concentration. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00242-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>C shows that the total antioxidant activity of PPEO was slightly lower than that of BHT at the concentrations lower than 0.4 mg/mL. However, as the concentration increased, the antioxidant activity of PPEO exceeded that of BHT. At the concentration of 1.0 mg/mL, the total antioxidant activity of PPEO was 20.35% higher than that of BHT. These results indicated that low-concentration PPEO has no obvious antioxidant effect while high-concentration PPEO has good antioxidant effect. Butylated hydroxytoluene is an industrially synthesized antioxidant that facilitates fast oxidation resistance at low concentrations, while PPEO is a mixture of various compounds with antioxidant activities, which may have complex interactions with each other [
