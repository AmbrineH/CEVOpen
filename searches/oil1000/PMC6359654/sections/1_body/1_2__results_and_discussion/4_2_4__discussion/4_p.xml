<p class="p">In addition, previous study showed that citral, myrcene, (2E)-alkenal, and terpinolene were popular tyrosinase inhibitors [

 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-citral. In plant EOs, the content of 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-citral is higher than that of 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-citral. Meanwhile, citral and myrcene are the main active substances that inhibit TYR in EOs [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Therefore, it is most likely that the inhibition of TYR expression by the components (limonene, β-myrcene, β-pinene, ocimene, β-copaene) in PPEO is a synergistic effect, and the main active components could be partly attributed to citral and myrcene.
