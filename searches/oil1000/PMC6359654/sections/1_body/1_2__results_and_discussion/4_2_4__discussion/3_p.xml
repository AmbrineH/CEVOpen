<p class="p">To our knowledge, TYR catalyzes the first two steps of mammalian melanogenesis [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], namely the hydroxylation of monophenol to 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-diphenol and the oxidation of diphenol to 
 <italic class="italic">o</italic>-quinones, both of which use molecular oxygen, followed by a series of nonenzymatic steps to finally result in the formation of melanin [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Therefore, inhibition of TYR activity may help to avoid abnormal melanin pigmentation in skin. The results of this study preliminarily demonstrated the good antioxidant performance of PPEO. In the co-culture of PPEO and B16 cells, PPEO acted as an antioxidant to inhibit the catalytic reaction of TYR and block the synthesis pathway of melanin, resulting in a decrease in melanin production. Meanwhile, the effect of PPEO on the dendritic morphology of cells might also destroy the normal physiological functions of cells, which in turn affects the formation of melanin in cells. The above results demonstrate that PPEO can decrease the melanin content without affecting the cell viability.
