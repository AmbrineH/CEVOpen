<p class="p">Previous studies have shown that the characteristic aroma of pomelo is mainly attributable to a variety of compounds [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In this study, we first extracted PPEO from pomelo cv. Guan Xi and analyzed its main components using GC/MS. Our study demonstrated that the fresh and natural fruit aromas were mainly due to the presence of aldehydes and terpenoids in PPEO. The safety of natural products used in health foods, drug, and cosmetic ingredients is a major concern. Several studies have explored the use of extracts from pulp of guava [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Meanwhile, it has been reported that terpenes such as limonene, β-myrcene, β-pinene, ocimene, β-copaene, and citral showed anti-oxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The strong anti-oxidant activity of PPEOs may be attributable to these components. In our experiment, PPEO was extracted using a cold pressing method under normal temperature conditions, which could better preserve the active components with antioxidant function, resulting in a high total antioxidant capacity. It is known that ultra violet (UV) radiation induces free radical formation in the skin, which is linked directly to the onset of skin photodamage and biological damage. Thus, our results suggest that PPEO may be a useful anti-oxidant source and have the potential to prevent UV-induced damage.
