<p class="p">Next, we highlighted the anti-melanogenic effects of PPEO through cell viability, cell morphology, intracellular melanin content, intracellular TYR activity and expression, and compared these results with those of the positive control (kojic acid). Previous studies have shown that the action mechanism of terpenoids in cells is related to the destruction of lipophilic compounds in biofilms [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00242" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Due to the high hydrophobicity of terpenoids, their toxic effects lead to swelling and enhanced fluidity and permeability of the cell membranes [

However, when the concentration of PPEO was below 50 μg/mL, the state of the cell was normal. On considering this possibility, concentrations below 50 μg/mL of PPEO were used to evaluate its effects on melanin content and intracellular TYR activity.
