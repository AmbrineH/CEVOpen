<p class="p">Since 1997, the German botanist Baethlott [
 <xref rid="B31-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] reported that water droplets sit on lotus leaves with water contact angle larger than 150° and roll off easily carrying away the dust when tilting and this phenomenon is defined as the “lotus effect”. This extraordinary property is named as superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning [
 <xref rid="B32-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Further investigation showed that lotus leaf is comprised of nano/microhierarchical structures and they are coated with low surface energy wax to reduce surface energy, thereby delivery superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning property (

 <xref rid="B29-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. This unique property can be used to design superhydrophobic membranes to eliminate oil from water achieving oil/water separation. In 2004, Feng et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] developed superhydrophobic-superoleophilic copper mesh by dip-coating hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene and oil was removed from water through this membrane under gravity-driven separation. Another example learning from nature is mimicking the superhydrophilic-underwater superoleophobic structures from fish scales (regular fan-shaped microstructures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>b)) to fabricate oil/water separation membranes to remove water from oil/water mixture and keep cleaning from oils [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In 2011 Xue et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] fabricated superhydrophilic polyacrylamide (PAM) mesh, which allows water penetration while repelling oil, thereby reduces oil pollution. Dunderdale et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] prepared a more advanced amphiphilic stainless steel mesh which was modified by hydrophilic polymethacrylic acid (PMAA) and hydrophobic poly(ethylhexylmethacrylate)(PEHMA) and can switch its surface wettability in response to various stimulations to effectively separate oil/water mixtures. After that, oil/water separation material with biomimetic super-wettability has undergone rapid development [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. However, the issues of membrane fouling and weak intrusion pressure restrict the long-term operation. Recently, two meshes with opposite wettability were modified by polymer brush and combined to treat oil/water solutions, resulting in high efficiency under high flux and keeping surfaces free from oil contamination [
 <xref rid="B40-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, membranes cannot be used to adsorb or store the spilled oils. Therefore, designing a new type of oil/water separation material with high selectivity, adsorption capacity, anti-fouling property, and recyclability is essential for long–term oily wastewater treatment.
