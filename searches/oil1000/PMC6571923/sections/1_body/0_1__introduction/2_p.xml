 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] have been widely utilized to purify oily wastewater. These methods show unique advantages in oily wastewater treatment. Gravity-driven separation can effectively separate oil from water by using the density difference between oil and water [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Traditional membrane filtration allows the penetration of small water molecules while prohibiting the passing through of oils under the assistance of pressure or electrical potential achieving oil/water separation [

 <xref rid="B19-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Flocculants are commonly used agents to eliminate floated, dispersed, and emulsified oils in water through coagulating oils into large precipitates to achieve oil/water separation [
 <xref rid="B20-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Floatation separates the oil/water mixtures via pushing oil droplets to the surface by bubbling [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The mixed oils in water can also be removed by adsorbing. Many adsorbents e.g., wood sheets, zeolites, fabrics, cotton, and linen etc. with large surface area and porosity are easy to obtain from nature and widely used for oil adsorption to separate oil from water [

Nevertheless, the significant shortcomings of these methods, for instance, low separation efficiency and large space occupation of gravity separation, fouling and poor oil/water selectivity of membrane separation, difficulty in reuse/recycling of adsorbents and flocculants, low adsorption capacity and secondary pollution, etc., restrict their practical applications in oily wastewater treatment [
