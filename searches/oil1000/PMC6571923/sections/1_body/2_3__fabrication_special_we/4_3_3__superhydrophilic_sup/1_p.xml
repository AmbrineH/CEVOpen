<p class="p">In oil mining industry, water droplets disperse into oil and water-in-oil emulsions cause the impure of oil. Thus, removing water from the bulk oil is critical for oil purification. The superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic-underwater superoleophobic 3D-PMs are oleophilic which cannot remove minor water from oil/water mixture or water-in-oil emulsion. A new type of superhydrophilic-superoleophobic 3D-PMs have been developed by changing the structure of the super-wetting coating. The mechanisms of designing this unique surface are widely investigated. Okada et al. [

When water contacts the composite surface, the hydrophilic unit (–COOH) of FAAO is attracted by water molecules causing surface wetting. On the contrary, the hydrophilic unit is flattened by contacting with oils while the fluoroalkyl unit exhibits erect state showing oil repellency. Brown et al. [
 <xref rid="B201-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>] designed a new type flip-flop coating by the layer-by-layer deposition and each layer was interacted by the strong electrostatic interaction. Cationic polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) is chosen as the base layer to bind strongly onto negatively charged glass surface and SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. Then the second (negatively charged SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles) and third layers (cationic PDDA) are assembled onto the surface strongly by the electrostatic force. Finally, the fluorosilane were deposited on the last layer to deliver hydrophilic-oleophobicity (WCA &lt; 5°, OCA = 157°). The mechanism of delivering such unique wettability can be explained as follow that the –COOH group of perfluorooctanoic acid is more polar than CF
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> which preferentially adheres to the surface of the substrate while the fluorinated tail heading out to form low surface energy interface showing oil repellency [

 <xref rid="B202-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>] utilized sodium atoms (Na) to replace the hydrogen atoms in –COOH group thereby molecules with low surface energy tails and high surface energy heads were formed resulting in superhydrophilicity and oil repellency (
