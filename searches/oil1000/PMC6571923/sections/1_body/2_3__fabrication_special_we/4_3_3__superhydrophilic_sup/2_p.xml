After that, the composite polyurethane (PU) sponge was treated by ammonia vapor to transfer superhydrophilicity-superoleophobicity to superhydrophobic-superoleophobicity. The modified PU sponge can easily remove water from the bottom of the diesel oil without any oil residues left in water (

This method does not require pretreatment (wet by water) or the formation of oil repellent water films. Moreover, combining with the peristaltic pump, the superhydrophilic-superoleophobic sponge can continuously remove large amounts of water pollutants from bulk oil by (
