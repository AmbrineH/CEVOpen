<p class="p">To reduce the fabrication cost and minimize the adverse effects on the environment, using nature materials such as cellulose is an alternative way to develop oil/water separation aerogels [

 <xref rid="B191-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">191</xref>]. Cellulose originates from natural resources e.g., natural plants, household waste paper, etc., showing the advantages of low cost, high mechanical property, environmentally friendly, biodegradable materials which can be used to fabricate aerogels via freeze-drying [

 <xref rid="B194-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>]. However, cellulose is hydrophilic and, thus, can be easily wetted by water and needs hydrophobic modification. Mi et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] used bidirectional freeze-drying (control the growth of ice crystals on the y and z axes) and siliconization, obtaining ultra-light (bulk density: 0.0059 g/cm

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>a). The as-prepared composite aerogel can float on dandelion and shows excellent oil adsorption capacity (80–197 times oil or organic solvents of its own weight) due to multi-layered sheet structure, larger porosity and high BET surface area (47.3 m

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>b). Besides, the composite cellulose aerogel shows high mechanical stability that it recovered to the original size under 50% strain after 100 times cycling compression tests (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>c). However, the irregularity and discontinuity of cellulose leads to the difficulty in precisely controlling the mechanical properties and large scale fabrication [

 <xref rid="B196-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>] used polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers as the main precursor and crosslinked by the bifunctional benzoxazine (BA-a) to construct elastic networks, and then introduced rigid SiO

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>d). The 3D porous structure is relatively stable even after 1000 cycling compressive fatigue test with 60% strain. The nanofibre aerogels can rapidly and effectively separate oil/water emulsions under gravity driven with much higher separation flux comparing with other pressure-driven separation materials due to the numerous multi-level microchannels. By combining with pump, it shows continuous oil/water emulsion separation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref>e,f). Though the aerogels have attracted extensive attentions and the fabrication techniques promote the progress of developing oil/water separation 3D porous materials, its complicated fabrication procedures and the high requirement on temperature and pressure restrict its further application.
