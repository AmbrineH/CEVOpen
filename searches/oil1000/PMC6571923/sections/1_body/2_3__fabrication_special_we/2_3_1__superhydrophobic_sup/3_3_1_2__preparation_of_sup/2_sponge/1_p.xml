<p class="p">Foaming is broadly used to fabricate sponges/foams due to the mass production, ease of fabrication, and abundant pore structures using foaming agents [

 <xref rid="B165-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">165</xref>]. The widely used inorganic foaming agents to fabricate oil/water separation foams are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), ammonium carbonate, ammonium nitrite, etc. Among which, NaHCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is more favorable due to non-toxicity and the formation of uniform and dense pore structures by decomposing into carbon dioxide under thermal heating [
 <xref rid="B166-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">166</xref>]. Kong et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>] utilized polyether polyol, isophorone diisocyanate, and dibutyltin dilaurate as raw materials and NaHCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> as foaming agent to fabricate flexible PU sponge at 100 °C via pyrolysis. Since PU sponge is hydrophilic, by adding a certain amount of hydrophobic γ-(methacryloyloxy)propyltrimethoxysilane (KH-570) modified Al
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> hollow spheres during foaming to increase the surface roughness and reduce the surface energy correspondingly, which resulted in highly hydrophobicity (WCA: 144°) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>b). The obtained composite sponge can absorb 5–37 times oil of its own weight and the oil adsorption capacity is significantly improved (10–50%) compared to PUF without Al
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> modification. Besides, Al
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-modified PUF showed relatively high oil adsorption stability after 20 times of cycling oil/water separation. However, the fabrication process is relatively complex and requires harsh environmental parameters to foam. Recently, sugar/salt particles and sodium bicarbonate are reported as a pore-forming template to simplify the fabrication of foams/sponge because they can be easily removed through immersing in water/solvent or decomposition under thermal heating without secondary pollution or pore structure damage. Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B134-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>] used the cube sugar as template to fabricate polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sponge with highly hydrophobicity (WCA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>c), which can absorb 5 times its initial weight oils (silicone oil, motor oil, transformer oil). The oil (chloroform) adsorption capacity was slightly improved from 9 to 11 times of its original weight while using different size (several hundred micrometers or even centimeters) of sugar particles (granulated + sanding and granulated + black sugar particles) as a template (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>d). Similarly, Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>] used NaCl microparticles as template to prepare the hydrophobic PDMS sponge and h can absorb 5–20 times oil or organic solvents. However, hydrophobic PDMS sponge prevents water from entering and dissolving the sugar/salt microparticles causing sugar or salt residues left into the sponge affecting pore structure, wettability and elasticity. Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B107-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>] reported that they used the citric acid monohydrate (CAM) as a hard template to create pore structures and fabricate PDMS sponge. CAM can be easily removed by dissolving in ethanol within 6 h because ethanol completely wets the porous PDMS sponge. The PDMS sponge can absorb 7–15 times oil or organic solvents and the separation efficiency reached up to 99.8%. However, the pore size and porosity of the as-prepared 3D-PMs via foaming or templating methods are much larger and smaller than the commercial sponge, correspondingly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>a) leading to the relatively lower hydrophobicity and oil adsorption capacity. Besides, the pore structure and pore size rely on the size of template with which it is difficult to fabricate uniform and smaller pores. To solve this shortcoming, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B167-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>] used the thermally-impacted phase separation method to prepare the low density and high porosity polymer foam by firstly mixing the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), dioxane, and deionized water together to form a homogeneous solution and then removing the dioxane and water from the TPU by decreasing the temperature. The superhydrophobic PU foam was successfully prepared via freeze-drying after 24 h. The foam shows highly porosity (91%) and excellent mechanical properties, which only reduced approximately 25% after 1000 compression cycling test at 80% strain. The PU foam can absorb 10–32 times its initial weight in different types of oils or organic solvents. To reduce the cost and achieve eco-friendliness, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] used biodegradable poly (lactic acid) (PLA) to fabricate the superhydrophobic polymer foam via phase separation and freeze-drying. The result had a large number of mesopores and high surface area (&gt;96.7 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g by BET test), which could absorb 23 times engine/silicone oil of its original weight.
