 <xref rid="B182-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>] have been reported for oil/water separation because of the unique properties of ultra-light and relatively high specific surface area. However, conventional silicon aerogels such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) aerogels are easy to crack under a certain pressure, causing the collapse of the 3D porous structure [
 <xref rid="B183-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>,
 <xref rid="B184-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">184</xref>]. Gurav et al. [
 <xref rid="B185-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>] used a two-step sol–gel method to fabricate superhydrophobic TEOS-based silica aerogel (WCA:153°) in which firstly dissolved tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) to form sol and added NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>F/NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>OH to form gel and obtained a 3D structure after a certain period of aging. The superhydrophobicity originated from the utilization of hexamethyldisilazane. Such superhydrophobic aerogel can absorb about 10 times its initial weight in petrol oil. However, the silica aerogel shrinks by nearly 50% and the 3D structure collapsed after compression to squeeze the adsorbed oils (

 <xref rid="B137-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>] used organosilane dimethyldiethoxylsilane (DMDES) and methyltriethoxysilane (MTMS) as co-precursors, which dissolved in ethanol to fabricate the silicon aerogels (density: 0.0897 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) via the sol-gel. The obtained aerogel showed excellent elasticity, which was due to non-polar methyl groups in backbones and the reduction of the inter-chain cohesion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>b). The abundant hydrophobic methyl groups on MTMS contributes to the superhydrophobicity (WCA 153.6°) of the composite aerogel, thereby the as-prepared aerogel absorbed 6–17 times its own weight in oil or organic solvents and maintained its structure after 10 cycles of oil adsorption and desorption at 60% strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>c). Recently, bridged silsesquioxane aerogels are more favorable due to the significantly improved mechanical strength through the formation of covalent bonding between inorganic siloxane and organic functional groups [
 <xref rid="B186-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B187-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>] used terephthalaldehyde (TPAL) and 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES) as a bridging silsesquioxane precursor and MTMS to fabricate the highly hydrophobic silicon composite aerogel (142°) via the catalytic reaction of acetic acid and freeze-drying. The bridged silsesquioxane aerogel can absorb 8–23 times oil or non-polar organic solvents of its initial weight, and are stable after more than 10 times cycling compression at 50% strain. The BET indicates the specific surface area of the bridged silsesquioxane aerogel was 26.7 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g, which was relatively low, leading to the poor adsorption capacity. To further improve the oil adsorption capacity, varied types of carbon aerogels were fabricated such as graphene, CNTs, cellulose, etc. by hydrothermal reaction [
 <xref rid="B188-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">188</xref>], chemical reduction [
 <xref rid="B189-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">189</xref>], and thermal reduction [
 <xref rid="B190-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">190</xref>]. Ren et al. [
 <xref rid="B191-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">191</xref>] mixed GO nanosheets with melamine to prepare N-doped graphene aerogel via self-assembly and thermal annealing process (900 °C), and showed highly hydrophobic (WCA: 137.2°). Especially, the specific surface area of graphene aerogel was 852 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g, and it can absorb 52.6–111.6 times organic solvents of its initial weight. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B192-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">192</xref>] used sodium chlorite (SC)-activated poplars catkin (PC) as precursor to prepare PC aerogel, and then carbonized at 1000 °C and successfully obtained the superhydrophobic carbon aerogel with outstanding oil absorption capacity. It can absorb 81–161 times oil (pump oil petroleum ether, etc.) of its initial weight and the adsorption performance remains stable after more than 10 cycles of oil adsorption and desorption. Moreover, PC sponge shows excellent mechanical performance, and can retain its original shape without breaking or collapsing after 500 cycles at 50% strain. Nevertheless, the hydrothermal or carbonization process of preparation aerogels needs relatively high temperatures and the fabrication process of aerogels is always under harsh environment such as supercritical drying, acidic/basic solution, a long period of maintenance, freeze-drying, and relatively high pressure, and produces organic wastewater, which leads to the high cost and may cause secondary pollution.
