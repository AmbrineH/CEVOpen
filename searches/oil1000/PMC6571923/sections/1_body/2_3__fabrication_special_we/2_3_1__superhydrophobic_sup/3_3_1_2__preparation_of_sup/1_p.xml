<p class="p">Though the superhydrophobicity can be easily obtained by surface modification with organic/inorganic compounds, the modification layer generates adverse effects on the flexibility and adsorption capacity of the sponge. Moreover, the pore structure (e.g., diameter, porosity) cannot be precisely adjusted through this method [

In order to well-tune the porous structure and improve the mechanical robustness of the sponge, the superhydrophobic sponge can be prepared through assembling of the polymers via freeze-drying, electrospinning, or polymer foaming.
