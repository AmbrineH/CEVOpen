<p class="p">3D-PMs with superhydrophobicity-superoleophilicity repel water while it can be wetted by oils allowing the passing through of oils to remove oil from water. Nowadays, three types of superhydrophobic-superoleophilic 3D-PMs e.g., sponge, foams and aerogels have been developed to adsorb light oil from water surface [

Currently, two common ways are employed to prepare superhydrophobic 3D-PMs porous materials: (a), utilize the inherent pore structures of commercial PU/melamine/PMMA sponges to achieve superhydrophobicity through surface modification e.g., dip-coating [
