<p class="p">Commercial sponge/foams (polyurethane, melamine, polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(melamine formaldehyde)) are inexpensive porous materials with high porosity (typically &gt; 95%), low density (&lt;18 mg/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>), regular skeleton, elasticity, high mechanical property and chemical stability which are widely used in industry and daily life such as, thermal insulation, sound absorption and shock absorption [

These outstanding properties of commercial sponge/foam enable they can be used for oil/separation after proper modifications. Generally, both water and oil can wet and pass through commercial sponges which is lack of selectivity and oil/water separation performances [

However, designing superhydrophobicity to repel water penetration via different types of materials including organic, inorganic, and composite agents by changing surface energy or surface structure is regarded as an easy and feasible way.
