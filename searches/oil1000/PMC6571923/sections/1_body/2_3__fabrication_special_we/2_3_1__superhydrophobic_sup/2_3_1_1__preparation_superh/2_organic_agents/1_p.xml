<p class="p">Commercial sponges/foams have abundant microporous structures and can reach superhydrophobicity after surface energy reduction and surface roughness increment. During the past decades, a variety of organic polymers with low surface energy such as hydrophobic organosilanes [

 <xref rid="B125-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>] and long-chain alkanes (i.e., fluorine/amine/thiol) [

 <xref rid="B141-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>] are extensively used to modify commercial sponges/foams by dip coating, solution-immersion, vapor deposition, situ-polymerization, chemical bonding, and crosslinking (
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00806-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B124-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>] firstly etched the original polyurethane (PU) foam by CrO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solution to create rough structures on skeleton. The water contact angle on the sponge decreased from 56° to 0° and the sponge became superhydrophilc after etching. Then the hydrophobic fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) was grafted onto the sponge to reduce the surface energy and the water contact angle was larger than 155° with the sliding-off angle less than 5° via solution immersion. The self-cleaning property is very important for the foam and can be used to remove dust from the foam surface avoiding the blocking of pores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>e). The obtained superhydrophobic foam can selectively eliminate gasoline, crude oil, and petroleum ether from oily wastewater and the separating efficiency is above 95%. Methyltrichlorosilane with low surface energy was also reported to modify the PU sponge to reduce surface energy to delivery superhydrophobicity (

 <xref rid="B108-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. However, fluorosilane and chlorosilanes are usually toxic, with ease of deliquescent and hydrolysis to generate hydrogen fluoride or hydrogen chloride causing adverse effects to the environment. Organosiloxane is non-toxic organic matter with hydrophobicity, which can anchor to the surface firmly through cross-linking or situ-polymerization. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B125-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>] dip-coated the diluted polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and hexane precursor onto a melamine sponge to fabricate superhydrophobic sponge (WCA &gt; 150°) for oil/water separation. This superhydrophobic sponge can absorb 45–75 times oils or organic solvents of its initial weight and maintains stable oil adsorption capacity after 20 cycles of oil absorption and squeezing. Xiong et al. [
 <xref rid="B140-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>] grafted the hydrolyzed 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH-570) onto PU foam through the reaction between alkoxysilane molecules and the isocyanate groups on PU foam and reached superhydrophobicity, which can absorb about 100 times its initial weight oil (lubricating oil, diesel oil, crude oil etc.) from oil/water mixture showing excellent oil adsorption property (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>d). To increase the stability of the coated organic coatings, chemical bonding is regarded as an effective way. Oribayo et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] firstly coated dopamine onto melamine sponge to form PDA coating via self-polymerization of PDA. Strong covalent and noncovalent bonds are formed during the polymerization of dopamine, which increased the durability of the coating resulting in long term operation. The superhydrophobicity of PDA-coated melamine sponge was achieved via grafting with low surface tension 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H perfluorodecanethiol (PFD) or octadecylamine (ODA) agents. PFD and ODA are chemically bonded to PDA surface through Michael or Schiff-base reaction via dipping-coating method [
 <xref rid="B142-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. The as-prepared superhydrophobic sponge can absorb about 90 times oil (engine oil, silicone oil etc.) of its original weight. Besides, the strong PDA chemical bonds enable robust hydrophobicity and adsorption property after 50 cycles of oil adsorption. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] used the aniline to suit-polymerization onto melamine sponge and grafted with low surface energy dodecyl mercaptan to delivery superhydrophobicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>a). After coating, the skeleton became rough while the coated polyaniline (PANI) showed negligible effect on decreasing the pore size (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>c). The obtained superhydrophobic PANI-sponge can adsorb different types of oil or organic solvents about 51–121 times of its initial weight. Moreover, PANI-sponge also was used in oil-in-water emulsion separation. The etching/polymerization can only randomly increase the roughness of the sponge, which may cause the differences in hydrophobicity at different positions on the surface or internal skeleton. However, post-modification on commercial sponge/foam using organic agents makes it difficult to creating uniformity and desired roughness and surface structure. Besides, the mechanical property of the modified sponge/foam is still a concern after several times of oil desorption under compression due to the weak mechanical robustness of the original commercial sponge/foam.
