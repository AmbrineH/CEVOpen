 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, etc.) are sort of important materials in polymer composites due to the high chemical and mechanical stability with relatively low cost [

 <xref rid="B160-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">160</xref>]. Thus, they can be utilized to enhance the wettability and mechanical performance of sponges/foams. Ge et al. [
 <xref rid="B161-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">161</xref>] synthesized hydrophobic SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from chlorotrimethylsilane and mixed with polyfluorowax (PFW) to firmly coat onto PU sponge via dip-coating. The incorporation of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles made the surface rough and PFW reduced surface energy resulting in superhydrophobicity. Besides, the utilization of PFW fixed SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles strongly onto PU sponge after curing and delivered robust superhydrophobicity (WCA was only dropped 5° (original: 156°)). The composite sponge showed relatively high mechanical stability by adding certain amount of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles after 400 cycles of compression tests under the strain of about 75%. However, chlorotrimethylsilane is inflammable and is easily hydrolyzed into hydrogen chloride, which is unsafe and caused the loss of hydrophobicity and oil/water selectivity. To avoid this, Salehabadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>] utilized octylsilane to modify SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles showing that PU sponge reached superhydrophobic state after coating with 2 vol % modified SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>c
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>). As comparison, the obtained superhydrophobic SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-coated PU sponge can absorb 61–72 times of its initial weight oils showing high adsorption capacity. However, the un-hydrophobized SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> tend to agglomerate on the PU sponge at high concentration (3 vol %) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>c
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), causing the decrease of wettability and the oil adsorption capacity dropped more than 5 times. Lei et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] firstly deposited Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> nanoparticles onto melamine sponge and then coated with lignin by dip-coating to prepare the superhydrophobic composite sponge, which can be driven under magnetic field to quickly separate from oil/water mixture after absorbed the oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>d), thereby increasing the separation efficiency. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a sort of metal–organic framework (MOF) in which porosity and specific surface area are relatively high, showing the potential in adsorption organic compounds [
 <xref rid="B59-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B155-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>,
 <xref rid="B162-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">162</xref>]. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B155-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">155</xref>] first carbonized melamine sponge under Ar atmosphere and then the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was nucleated and grew onto the composite surface in Zn
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> and 2-methylimidazole (MIM) solution at room temperature. The obtained ZIF-8 modified sponge showed highly hydrophobic (WCA: 135°) and high specific surface area (BET: 211 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g) which can absorb 55–136 times oil (pump oil, chloroform etc.) of its initial weight. Inorganic-polymer composite coating increases the hydrophobicity, roughness and the durability of the sponge comparing with only using single inorganic/organic modifications. The incorporated inorganic nanomaterials with unique property can equip the sponge with multifunctional properties such as electrical conductivity, magnetic, photoresponse, which broadens the development of 3D-PMs.
