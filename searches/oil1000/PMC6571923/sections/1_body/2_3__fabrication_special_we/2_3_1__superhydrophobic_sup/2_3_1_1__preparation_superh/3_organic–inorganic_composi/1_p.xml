Carbon materials have been extensively used in the field of adsorption due to ultra-light, high specific surface area and non-toxicity. Recently, carbon materials have been utilized in 3D-PMs to enhance the adsorption capacity in oily wastewater treatment. Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] prepared the hydrophobic GO-PU sponge with WCA of 133.4° via solution immersion and thermal reduction, which can separate different type oil–water mixtures (bromobenzene, carbon tetrachloride, hexane, etc.) and the separation efficiency is higher than 90%. To increase the oil/water separation efficiency, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] used the γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane (KH-570) to modify GO and coated onto PU sponge via dip-coating to prepare the superhydrophobic-superoleophilic sponge. WCA increased from 129° to 161° after modified with KH-570 and the oil absorption capacity was enhanced to more than 39 times of its initial weight, which was improved nearly two times compared to the pure PU sponge. Nguyen et al. [
 <xref rid="B156-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>] used the hydrophobic graphene nanosheets (WCA:132°) and PDMS as cements to increase the bonding force between graphene coating and the commercially sponge via solution immersion method. The WCA of the fabricated sponge was 162°, which was superhydrophobic. The oil or organic solvents adsorption capacity of graphene-based sponge was around 54–165 times its original weight and showed relatively stable solvent adsorption performances after 5 cycles of adsorption-desorption However, the oil adsorption capacity dropped nearly 80% in the second cycle of oil adsorption-desorption (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00806-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>a) because the oil adhered to the skeleton, and was difficult to squeeze out via compression. To address this issue, Ge et al. [
 <xref rid="B157-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>] fabricated hydrophobic and conductive GO-wrapped-melamine sponge (MS) via dip coating. This conductive GO-wrapped-MS significantly lower the viscosity of crude oil when the sponge was heated up to 90 °C through applying DC voltage showing fast and large oil adsorption (adsorb 3.87 g crude oil in 6 s) comparing to the original sponge (adsorb 1.5 g crude oil in 8 min) (

 <xref rid="B158-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">158</xref>] mixed the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with PDMS to modify the PU sponge via dip-coating method obtaining superhydrophobic CNTs-PU sponge and lowered the viscosity of heavy oil under light irradiation which effectively enhanced oil adsorption capacity and self-cleaning performances. 3D-PMs are easily contaminated and adhered by high viscosity oil which is difficult to squeeze out the oil residues and caused surface contamination. Electrically induced joule heating and the light irradiation heating can significantly decrease the viscosity of oils resulting in quick adsorption and surface cleaning, showing high promising in practical oil/water separation. However, the large energy input with relatively low energy utilization, and the thermal stability of the polymer sponge under high temperature are needed to be solved in the future.
