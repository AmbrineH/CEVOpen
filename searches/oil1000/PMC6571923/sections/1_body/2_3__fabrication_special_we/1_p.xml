<p class="p">The fabrication of super-wetting 3D-PMs follows the classical theories by the combination of creating hierarchical structures (nano/microstructure) and surface chemistry modification. The surface structure can be fabricated via many methods such as etching, nanomaterials modification while the surface chemistry can be tubed through low or high surface energy molecules. During the past decades, a variety of research articles have been published on fabricating special wettable 3D-PMs through post-modification, self-assembly, phase separation etc. (

Self-assembly includes polymerization, freeze-drying, solâˆ’gel process, electrospinning, phase separation, etc. and aerogel and sponge with ultralight, large specific surface area and porosity can be fabricated through this method. The common used techniques to develop different type of super-wetting 3D-PMs are summarized in
