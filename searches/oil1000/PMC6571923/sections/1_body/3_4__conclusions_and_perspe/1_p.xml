<p class="p">In this article, we briefly reviewed the typical materials and techniques which are utilized in the recent development of superhydrophobic-superoleophilic, superhydrophilic-superoleophobic, superhydrophilic-underwater superoleophobic, switchable super-wetting polymeric oil/water separation three dimensional (3D) porous materials such as sponge, foam and aerogels. By reviewing the effects of wettability on oil/separation, the desired wettability on dealing the specific oil/water mixtures was developed correspondingly. There are a variety of polymers can be used to fabricate super-wettable 3D-PMs through similar techniques. However, the requirements of wettability are not the same due to their unique roles in separating specific oil/water mixtures. Surface wettability be tuned through the low surface energy polymers and nanomaterials. The utilized nanomaterials significantly enhanced the roughness to improve the wettability and separation efficiency. Moreover, the incorporated nanomaterials can also be applied to improve the mechanical stability of 3D-PMs. The organicâ€“inorganic nanomaterials modification coatings show great potential in developing high performance 3D-PMs to meet the advanced requirements in current and the future oily wastewater treatment.</p>
