<p class="p">However, there are some challenges in developing polymeric 3D-PMs and their utilization in oil/water separation in the following aspects: (i) materials and technologies that are suitable for large-scale, simple and low-cost production, environmentally friendly, and avoid secondary pollution; (ii) the actual oily wastewater is complicated, especially with high adhesion and high density oils, one of the significant shortcomings that restricts the application in oil/water separation is oil contamination, thus developing superwetting polymeric 3D-PMs with anti-oil-pollution is critical; (iii) squeezing the adsorbed liquid after long-term filtration or adsorption is a fundamental requirement for cycling oil/water separation, thus, developing 3D-PMs with excellent mechanical stability and elasticity is crucial; (iv) the stability of superwetting coating determines the efficient selectivity of 3D-PMs, but they are easily peeled off from the surface, leading to the loss of super-wettability. We expect that, in the near future, the above issues can be solved gradually to promote the applications of super-wetting 3D-PMs in oily wastewater treatment with high efficiency, anti-fouling, and mechanical robust performance.</p>
