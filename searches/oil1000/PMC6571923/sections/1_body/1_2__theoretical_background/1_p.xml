<p class="p">Surface wettability is the fundamental property of 3D-PMs for the applications in oil/water separation. Either hydrophilic or hydrophobic 3D-PMs cannot be directly used because both oil and water can wet and pass through the porous structure [

 <xref rid="B69-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Thus, developing the 3D-PMs with selectively oil/water separation property is critical and can be achieved by creating special wettability [

 <xref rid="B33-polymers-11-00806" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Thus, the modification of surface energy and the construction of proper pore structure are vital to super-wetting 3D-PMs. Besides, the wettability and surface structure are also an important parameter to determine the separation efficiency and the surface fouling.
