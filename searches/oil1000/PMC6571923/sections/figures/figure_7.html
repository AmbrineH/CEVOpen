 <p> Schematic illustration of liquid-wetting modes of 3D materials [ 74, 89, 90]; ( a) because Δ p is positive, the superhydrophobic 3D material repels the water penetration by the trapped air. ( b) because Δ p is negative, the oil can permeate the superhydrophobic 3D material spontaneously. ( c) there are two states of the oil supported by superhydrophilic 3D materials: ( c 1 ) the oil layer supported by the trapped air in cavities, ( c 2 ) the oil layer supported by the trapped water in cavities; reproduced with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. </p>
