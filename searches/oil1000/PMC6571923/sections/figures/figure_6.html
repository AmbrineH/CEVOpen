 <p> ( a– c) Illustration of the behavior wetting effect by surface structure of the solid substrates in oil/water [ 30]. ( a) smooth surface, ( b) microstructure surface, ( c) micro/nanohierarchical surface in liquid b; reproduced with permission from Wiley. ( d, e) Illustration of the theoretical extreme wettability of solid substrate surface in water/oil [ 87]. The substrate exposed in the water or oil shows four oil–water states: ( d 1 ) superoleophobic, ( d 2 ) superoleophilic, ( e 1 ) superhydrophobic, ( e 2 ) superhydrophilic. o-g: oil and gas interface, w-g: water and gas interface; reproduced with permission from American Chemical Society. </p>
