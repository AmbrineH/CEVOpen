<p class="p">The literature highlights various biological effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Perilla frutescens</italic>. Jun et al., investigated phenolic antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens var. acuta</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and Zhou et al., reported that two phenolic compounds in cold-pressed 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens var. arguta</italic> seed flour, namely rosmarinic acid and rosmarinic acid-3-O-glucoside, had superior antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In addition to the antioxidative capacity, Jeon et al., identified luteolin in perilla leaves using HPLC and found that luteolin had anti-inflammatory activity against cytokines and antipruritic activity in mice [

 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens var. acuta</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Kim et al., discovered that pepsin-hydrolyzed perilla leaf extracts had anti-neuronal damage activity on H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-induced DNA [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Lastly, He et al., isolated seven anthocyanins in 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens var. acuta</italic> and reported anticancer activity against Hela cells [
