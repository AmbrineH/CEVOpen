 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], only a few studies have examined the changes of flavor and taste characteristics and chemical properties after a cooking process such as roasting. Two different studies applied response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the roasting conditions of perilla leaves as a tea and found that roasting each at 210–220 °C for 10–20 min and 180 °C for 20 min yielded the best quality perilla leaf tea [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. These studies focused on the optimization of roasting conditions but did not examine the alterations of the taste and flavor and of chemical properties over the roasting time. Further, Nam et al., tried to optimize steaming time and onion contents to make perilla pickles [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], and Moon et al., added perilla leaf powder to pork sausages in an investigation of its impact on sausage quality and consumer preference [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These two studies introduced perilla as a food ingredient and food additive but, again, did not analyze volatile compounds and the most relevant chemical parameters from a food chemistry perspective.
