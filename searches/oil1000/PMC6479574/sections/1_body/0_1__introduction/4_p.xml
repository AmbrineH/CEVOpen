 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton 
 <italic class="italic">var. acuta</italic> Kudo during roasting at 150 °C for various time points (0–8 min); 1) volatile compounds and sniffing test assisted sensory properties to examine flavor changes upon roasting; 2) taste related- constituent and free amino acid compositions and taste description by electronic tongue (E-tongue) to access taste changes by roasting; and 3) total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidative capacity, and browning intensity to describe chemical changes by roasting, in an effort to widen the application of perilla as food ingredients. The results of this study would provide informative data in food industrial applications and serve as a cornerstone in recognizing the potential of perilla as great food sources and food ingredients.
