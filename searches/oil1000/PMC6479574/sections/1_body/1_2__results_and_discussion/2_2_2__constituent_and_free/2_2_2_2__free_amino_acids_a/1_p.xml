<p class="p">The contents of free amino acids in 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton during the roasting were measured by an acid hydrolysis method and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Alanine was the most prevalent, followed by valine, hydroxylysine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The contents of alanine and GABA exhibited a significant decrease during the roasting from 37.33 ± 2.79 and 13.61 ± 0.01 at 0 min to 22.73 ± 1.60 and 8.96 ± 0.47 at 8 min, respectively. Alanine induces sweet taste as previously mentioned [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and the decreased alanine content with the roasting showed a similar pattern with that of constituent amino acids. GABA is an amino acid inhibitory neurotransmitter that regulates physiological functions and muscle movement in mammals, and a metabolite that controls stress and metabolic pathways in plants [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The contents of valine and hydroxylysine, on the contrary, were increased from 20.24 ± 0.92 and 18.13 ± 0.28 at 0 min to 28.59 ± 0.36 and 30.73 ± 1.11 at 8 min, respectively. Valine elicits bitter taste and acts as a synergistic factor that enhances umami taste [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Hydroxylysine induces sweet and bitter tastes [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Based on this result, 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton mainly consisted of free amino acids that induce sweet and bitter tastes.
