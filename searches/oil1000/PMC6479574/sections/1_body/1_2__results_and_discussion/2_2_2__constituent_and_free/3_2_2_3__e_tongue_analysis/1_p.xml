<p class="p">E-tongue analysis was performed to investigate chemical measures associated with the sensory characteristics of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01374-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The relative taste comparison of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton during the roasting showed that umami and bitterness increased whereas sourness and saltiness decreased. Sweetness remained unchanged. These results can be explained in relation to the constituent and free amino acids compositions explained in the previous section of this study. Increase of umami taste may be associated with the increase of glutamic acid and that of bitterness would be related to the increase of leucine, phenylalanine, and valine as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Although the amino acids eliciting sweet tastes including alanine and glycine increased, sweetness analyzed by e-tongue did not show a marked change over time. In case of sourness, aspartic acid inducing sour taste increased but corresponding sourness by e-tongue decreased. Such a discrepancy is probably because amino acids are not the sole factors of taste development but many other components including sugars, fatty acids, and volatile compounds participate complexely in taste development [
