<p class="p">Glutamic acid was the most abundant amino acid, followed by aspartic acid, alanine, glycine, leucine, and phenylalanine at 0 min. Overall, the contents of these amino acids showed various patterns without substantial changes. The contents of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and leucine increased from 14.68 ± 0.46, 12.45 ± 0.52, and 8.01 ± 0.08 at 0 min to 15.30 ± 0.38, 12.65 ± 0.32, and 8.15 ± 0.11 at 8 min, respectively. Glutamic acid alone elicits a sour taste but when it reacts with sodium, it becomes a good flavor enhancer, known as umami taste [
