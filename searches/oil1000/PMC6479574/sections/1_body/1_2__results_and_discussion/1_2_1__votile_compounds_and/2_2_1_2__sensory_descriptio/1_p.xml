<p class="p">A sniffing test of identified volatile compounds was performed by GC-olfactometry in order to describe the sensory attributes of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton during the roasting process. The result of sniffing test by three trained panelists is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Interestingly, methyl benzoate described as perilla odor gave the highest olfactory intensity (4) throughout the whole roasting time. This result was consistent with our volatile compound results. Although the content of methyl benzoate showed an increase and decrease trend as explained in the previous section, the intensity seems strong enough to be perceived by the panelists. Another major volatile compound identified by GC-MS, limonene, described as minty odor was perceived till 4 min at the lowest intensity (1). This result was also in agreement with our GC-MS result for limonene which was detected up to 4 min with relatively lower concentration. Whereas in the GC-MS result, azulene was in a small quantity, the sensory attributes of azulene such as spicy, medicinal herb, and garlic odors were perceived intensely (4 at 0 and 2 min, 3 at 6 min). A previous study detected 13 volatile compounds in the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton via a GC-olfactometry sniffing test and the most intensely perceived compounds were perilla ketone, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexenal (green), and egoma ketone [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In the present study, α-terpinene and γ-terpinene which elicit bitter odors were perceived with strong intensities at 0, 4 and 3 min, respectively, but they were not perceived at all in the roasted samples. As the bitter odor in fresh vegetables is a major cause of deterring consumers from purchase, elimination of the bitter odors through roasting may act positively in increasing perilla consumption.
