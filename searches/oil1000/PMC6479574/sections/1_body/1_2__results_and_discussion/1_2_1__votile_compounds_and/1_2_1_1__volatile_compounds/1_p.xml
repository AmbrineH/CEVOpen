 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. A total of 142 volatile compounds were found in 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton 
 <italic class="italic">var. acuta</italic> Kudo, among which hydrocarbons (110) accounted for the majority, followed by alcohols (16), miscellaneous compounds (5), aldehydes (5), heterocyclic compounds (3), ethers (2), and ketones (1). Of those volatile compounds, methyl benzoate and limonene were identified as predominant compounds in terms of relative concentration. Methyl benzoate was initially present in high concentration (88.08 μg/100 g) and then it increased to 203.10 μg/100 g at 4 min. It finally showed a substantial decrease after 8 min of roasting (21.31 μg/100 g). Methyl benzoate is an aromatic ester compound eliciting pleasant odors associated with herbal and fruity odors [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Recent studies demonstrated that methyl benzoate was identified as a major volatile compound in fermented green oranges [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], olives [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], and teas [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Similarly, limonene started with a relatively high concentration (54.66 μg/100 g), which increased to 137.24 μg/100 g at 4 min, and then decreased to 60.92 μg/100 g at 8 min. Limonene is an aliphatic terpene usually derived from oils in the peels of citrus fruits invoking citrus-like fruity odors [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Researchers described that limonene was one of the key volatile compounds in encapsulated orange oil [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], Chinese wolfberry [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], and Persian lime [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In this study, although 8-min roasting seems long enough to decompose both methyl benzoate and limonene, they remained at relatively high contents during the roasting process as they are known to be thermally stable compounds with high boiling points (198 °C [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and 175–177 °C [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], respectively). Besides those main compounds, there were low quantities of linalool, α-pinene, 2-β-pinene, azulene, dodecane, tetradecane, and caryophyllene which showed varying patterns over time. Dodecane and tetradecane showed good heat resistance, maintaining similar contents during the roasting, with a range of 1.79–2.44 μg/100 g and 1.84–3.15 μg/100 g, respectively. All of these volatiles showed the highest concentration at 4 min except for dodecane, which had the highest at 6 min. Ahmed et al., reported that perilla aldehydes, perilla ketones, limonene, shisofurane, and farnesene were the core compounds among 65 volatile compounds identified in the essential oil of

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Another study by Seo and Baek found 33 volatile compounds using GC-MS in the leaf of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton with four different extraction methods and identified perilla ketone, (
 <italic class="italic">Z</italic>)-3-hexenol, and 1-octen-3-ol as key compounds [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The results of the mentioned studies were slightly discrepant with what we observed in this study, presumably because of the differences in varieties (e.g., Britt vs. Britton) and sample preparation (e.g., heat treatment vs. four different extractions). One of the key mechanisms in developing volatile compounds is Maillard reaction, known as a non-enzymatic reaction [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Approximately 3500 volatile compounds are generated through Maillard reactions in the presence of amino acids, reducing sugars, and heat [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This additional heat largely governs the reaction by affecting the rate of volatile compound generation [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In general, low molecular weight decomposition products of amino acids and carbohydrates such as aldehydes and ketons are generated through Maillard reactions [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Based on the result of this study, 4 min roasting at 150 °C would be the optimum condition to retain the high amounts of volatile compounds in
