<p class="p">Absorbance at 420 nm was measured to determine browning intensity and the result is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. Browning intensity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton tended to increase with roasting time. The absorbance showed 0.15 ± 0.00 at 0 min and reached the highest at 6 min, 0.33 ± 0.00. It is generally accepted that increased brown color at high temperature over time is mainly caused by Maillard browning [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. After roasting at 6 min, however, the intensity decreased to 0.23 ± 0.00. Another study also observed a similar result in that brown color developed by heat treatment in 
 <italic class="italic">Polygonatum odoratum</italic> roots increased up to a certain time point and decreased afterward [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Kwon et al., explained that the substrates involved Maillard reaction such as reducing sugars and amino acids are depleted over time, thereby exerting a decrease in brown color development [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Considering that browning intensity is a critical determinant that can influence on consumer preference as well as food quality [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], investigation of proper roasting conditions is deemed necessary in respect to browning intensity.
