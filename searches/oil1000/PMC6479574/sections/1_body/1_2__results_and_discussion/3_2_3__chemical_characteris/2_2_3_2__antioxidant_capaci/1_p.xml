<p class="p">Antioxidant capacity was determined by measuring DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethyl benzothiazoline–6-sulphonic acid) radical scavenging activities and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The results of both DPPH and ABTS analyses showed a similar pattern. IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values decreased with roasting at 2–6 min (84–90 mg) and (3 mg) in DPPH and ABTS analyses, respectively, indicating that 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton had paramount antioxidant capacity at 2–6 min roasting. Similar to the increase of total phenolic content, thermal processing seems to induce the production of antioxidants and an increase of free polyphenols that can act as electron donors [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The antioxidant capacity substantially decreased at 8 min, showing an identical pattern with the result of total phenolic content shown in this study. A recent study by Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], investigated the antioxidative properties of roasted 
 <italic class="italic">Cynanchi wilfordii</italic> Radix and found that the sample roasted at 180 °C for 4 min produced the highest antioxidant capacity with no clear pattern with the increase of temperature and time. Both our study and the one by Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], indicate that roasting at high temperature for a longer time does not necessarily yield higher antioxidant capacity. Further investigation would be required for discovering the optimum roasting conditions of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton in regards to antioxidant capacity.
