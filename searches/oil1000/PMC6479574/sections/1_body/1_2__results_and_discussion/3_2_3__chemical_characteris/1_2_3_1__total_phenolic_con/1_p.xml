 <xref rid="molecules-24-01374-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. Total phenolic content is an important indicator of antioxidant capacity [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The highest total phenolic content appeared at 4 min and 6 min (0.11 ± 0.01). Phenolic compounds are known to be thermally stable and phenolic antioxidants produced by roasting such as reductone would greatly attribute to the increase of total phenolic content [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The increased total phenolic content, however, decreased to 0.04 ± 0.01 at 8 min. In the study by Yun et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] examining optimum roasting conditions of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> leaves for a tea, roasting at 160 °C for 25 min yielded the highest total phenolic content and the roasting beyond these conditions caused a decrease of the content, which is in agreement with the results of this study. It is therefore necessary to perform more studies investigating the optimum time and temperature to obtain high total phenolic content. Based on the results of this study, roasting at 150 °C for 6 min would be recommended to produce the highest total phenolic contents in
