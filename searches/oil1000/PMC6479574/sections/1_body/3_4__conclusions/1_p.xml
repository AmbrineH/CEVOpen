<p class="p">For extending the application of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton as a food and food ingredient, this study investigated volatile compounds, sniffing test-assisted sensory properties, constituent and free amino acid compositions, taste description by e-tongue, and chemical characteristics, including TPC, antioxidative capacity, and browning intensity in 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton after roasting at 150 Â°C for various time periods. Of 142 volatile compounds identified, methyl benzoate and limonene were the most abundant, and these were also detected as major compounds in the sniffing test-assisted sensory description. Amino acid analyses resulted that among the constituent amino acids, the contents of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and leucine, which induce umami taste, sour taste, and bitter taste, respectively, increased over the roasting time. Among free amino acids, the contents of valine and hydroxylysine eliciting bitter and bitter and sweet tastes, respectively, increased with roasting. The changes of amino acid composition by roasting were only somewhat matched to the taste description by e-tongue. The changes in sweetness and sourness analyzed by e-tongue did not correspond to the result of amino acid composition. For the chemical properties, TPC, antioxidative capacity, and browning intensity showed an increase pattern with roasting but decreased back after a certain time point (8 min). The result of this work provides baseline data on volatile and chemical compounds that may affect sensory properties and chemical properties of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton after different roasting times, increasing the feasibility of perilla utilization as a food and food ingredient in both the food industry and the cooking environment.
