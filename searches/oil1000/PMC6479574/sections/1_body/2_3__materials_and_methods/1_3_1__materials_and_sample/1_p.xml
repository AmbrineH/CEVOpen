 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The sample was air dried at 60 °C for moisture removal after which it was subjected to pulverization using a 50-mesh sieve. A sample (40 g) was roasted at 150 °C for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 min on a frying pan and an infrared thermometer (Infrared DT-8380, InnoCal Solutions Co., Vernon Hills, IL, USA) was used to measure the temperature. The roasted and pulverized sample was frozen and kept at −40 °C until further analyses.
