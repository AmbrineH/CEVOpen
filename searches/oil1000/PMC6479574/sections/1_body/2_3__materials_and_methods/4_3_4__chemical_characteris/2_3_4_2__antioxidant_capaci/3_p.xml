<p class="p">ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethyl benzo thiazoline–6-sulphonic acid) radical scavenging activity was measured by adapting the method by Van den Berg et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. 14 mM ABTS solution and 4.9 mM potassium persulfate solution were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and reacted in the dark for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with PBS buffer to make absorbance 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm, after which it was used as a working solution. The sample was diluted with distilled water (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/mL), and 20 µL of each diluted sample was taken and mixed with 180 μL of the working solution. The mixture was subsequently incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 10 min and absorbance was measured at 734 nm. Radical scavenging activity was calculated using the same formula above and IC
