 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton, DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline–6-sulphonic acid) radical scavenging activities were measured. DPPH radical scavenging activity was measured using a slight modification of a method described by Blois [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The sample was diluted with distilled water (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/mL). Next, 0.1 mM DPPH (1 mL, dissolved in 99% ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was added to 10 μL of diluted sample. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min. Absorbance was taken at 517 nm and radical scavenging activity was determined by the equation shown below:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">Radical scavenging activity (%) = (1 − absorbance of sample/absorbance of control) × 100
