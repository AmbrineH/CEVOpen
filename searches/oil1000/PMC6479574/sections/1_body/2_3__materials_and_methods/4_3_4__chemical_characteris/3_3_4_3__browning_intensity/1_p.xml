<p class="p">To determine browning intensity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton upon roasting, the sample (1 g) was extracted with 100 mL of distilled water at 60 °C for 10 min. Extracted solution (200 µL) was placed in a 96-well plate and absorbance was measured at 420 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan Go, Thermo-Fisher Scientific Co., Vantaa, Finland). Higher absorbance indicates higher browning intensity.
