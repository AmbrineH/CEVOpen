<p class="p">Total phenolic content of the sample was measured by Folin-Ciocalteu’s method [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-01374" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The sample (1 mg/mL) was diluted with distilled water. Forty μL of the solution was mixed with distilled water (200 μL) and then 2 N Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent (200 μL, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was added and mixed thoroughly for 30 s. Subsequently, 30% Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (600 μL, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and distilled water (160 μL) were added to the solution and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Total phenolic contents of the sample were determined by absorbance measurement at 750 nm. Gallic acid (0–500 μg/mL) was used as a standard and treated the same procedure as for the sample to quantify total phenolic compounds. Total phenolic content was calculated from the calibration curve.
