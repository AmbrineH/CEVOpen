<p class="p">To determine the contents of constituent amino acids, acid hydrolysis method using hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used. The sample (0.1 g) and 6 N HCl (3 mL) placed in a 20 mL flask were stirred for 10 min. The stirred sample was heated in a 110 °C preheated heating block (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Rockford, IL, USA) for 24 h, to induce the acid hydrolysis of proteins to amino acids. A portion (20 μL) of the mixture was taken and diluted with commercially available sodium dilution buffer (1 mL) for amino acid analyzer (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Then, 1 mL of this solution was filtered with a 0.2 μm membrane filter, followed by quantification of constituent amino acids using an automated amino acid analyzer (L-8900, Hitachi HighTech, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
