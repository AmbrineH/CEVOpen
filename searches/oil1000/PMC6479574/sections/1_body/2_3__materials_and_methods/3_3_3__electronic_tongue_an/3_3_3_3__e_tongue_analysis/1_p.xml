<p class="p">An electronic tongue module (E-tongue, ASTREE II, Alpha M.O.S, Toulouse, France) with seven sensors was used to investigate the compounds associated with taste characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">P. frutescens</italic> Britton upon roasting. Two sensors, SPS (spiciness) and GPS (metallic taste) sensors, were set as a reference. SRS (sourness), STS (saltiness), UMS (umami), SWS (sweetness) and BRS (bitterness) sensors represented for 5 basic tastes. The sample, 1 g, was extracted with 100 mL distilled water at 60 Â°C for 10 min and filtered with Whatman No. 1 filter paper (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The analysis was performed seven times and taste patterns were analyzed by multivariate analysis. The responses from the sensor were converted to scores ranged 1 to 12. Descriptive analysis was given for the resulted taste distribution and the results were shown in a radar plot, which indicates relative comparison among the tastes [
