 <p class="p">This study investigated changes of volatile compounds, sniffing test-assisted sensory properties, taste associated-constituent and free amino acid compositions, taste description by electronic-tongue, and chemical characteristics in 
  <italic class="italic">Perilla frutescens</italic> Britton 
  <italic class="italic">var. acuta</italic> Kudo after roasting at 150 °C for 0–8 min. A total of 142 volatile compounds were identified, among which methyl benzoate and limonene were predominant, regardless of roasting time, and these were also detected as the major compounds in the sniffing test by GC-olfactometry. For constituent amino acids analyzed by the acid hydrolysis method using hydrochloric acid (HCl), the concentration of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and leucine showed an increase pattern with increased roasting time, which results in umami taste, sour taste, and bitter taste, respectively. For free amino acids, valine and hydroxylysine eliciting bitter and bitter and sweet tastes, respectively, also tend to increase by roasting. The pattern of amino acid concentration by roasting was readily matched to the taste description by electronic-tongue but that of sweetness and sourness by electronic-tongue did not coincide with the amino acid composition. For the chemical properties, total phenolic content, antioxidative capacity, and browning intensity tend to increase with roasting but decreased by 8 min. The results of this study provide fundamental information on perilla in both the food industry and cooking environment for the sake of increasing the utilization of perilla as a food source and ingredient.
