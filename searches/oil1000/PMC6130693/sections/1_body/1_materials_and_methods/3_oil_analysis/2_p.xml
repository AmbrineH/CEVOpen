<p class="p">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was carried out in the fast mode on a Shimadzu GC-MS model GCMS-QP5050A, with the same column and the same operative conditions used for the analytical GC and the operating software GCMS solution version 1.02 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). We adjusted the ionization voltage at 70 eV, the electron multiplier at 900 V and the ion source temperature at 180 °C. Mass spectra data were acquired in the scan mode in an 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> range of 40–400. The same oil solutions (1 μL) were injected with the split mode (1:96).
