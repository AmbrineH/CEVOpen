<p class="p">Gas chromatographic (GC) analyses were run on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph, Model 17-A, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and with an operating software Class VP Chromatography Data System, version 4.3 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Analytical conditions were SPB-5 capillary column (15 m × 0.10 mm × 0.15 μm) and helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min). Injection was done in split mode (1:200), injected volume was 1 μL (4% essential oil/CH
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>Cl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> v/v), and the injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. Linear velocity in column 19 was cm/s. The oven temperature was held at 60 °C for 1 min, then programed from 60 to 280 °C at 10 °C/min then 280 °C for 1 min. Percentages of compounds were determined from their peak areas in the GC-FID profiles.
