 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO was diluted into a vehicle (0.1% Tween 80 in physiological solution) at concentrations of 1, 100 and 500 μg/mL. Drug incubation was performed for 30 min followed by nerve washout with physiological solution for additional 30 min. To quantify drug effects, we analyzed the compound action potential (CAP) amplitude (
 <italic class="italic">V
  <sub class="sub">CAP</sub>
 </italic>, in mV) by measuring the difference between the baseline and the maximal voltage achieved. The CAP depolarization velocity (
 <italic class="italic">DV
  <sub class="sub">CAP</sub>
 </italic>, in V/s) was the rate between 
 <italic class="italic">V
  <sub class="sub">CAP</sub>
 </italic> and the time required to reach the CAP peak. The time constant of repolarization (
 <italic class="italic">τ
  <sub class="sub">rep</sub>
 </italic>, in ms) was calculated by the equation: 
 <italic class="italic">V = V</italic>0
 <italic class="italic">*</italic>exp(
 <italic class="italic">−t/τ</italic>), as described by Alves et al. (
