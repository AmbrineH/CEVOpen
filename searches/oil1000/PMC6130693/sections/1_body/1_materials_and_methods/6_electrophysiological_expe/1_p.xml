<p class="p">The single sucrose gap technique was used as previously described by Gonçalves et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Briefly, rat sciatic nerves (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) were carefully removed and immediately positioned in an experimental chamber composed of five compartments (
 <italic class="italic">I–V</italic>), electrically isolated by solid vaseline. All compartments were filled with a physiological solution, composed of (in mM): NaCl 150; KCl 4; CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 2; MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 1; glucose 10 and HEPES 10. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Compartments 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">II</italic> of the chamber were used to apply supramaximal stimulation (6–10 V/100 ms), manually triggered at 5 min intervals (CF Palmer, London, UK). The compartment 
 <italic class="italic">III</italic> was superfused by isotonic sucrose (290 mM; 1 mL/min) to electrically isolate the neighbouring recording compartments. Compartments 
 <italic class="italic">IV</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic> were used for drug perfusion (1 mL/min) and data recording, acquired by a microcomputer-based 12-bit A/D converter (10.5 kHz) and later analyzed by proper software (Lynx, São Paulo, Brazil)).
