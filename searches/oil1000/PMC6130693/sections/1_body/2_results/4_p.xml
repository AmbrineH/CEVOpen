<p class="p">Testing the 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO in the peripheral nerve excitability, we showed that 500 μg/mL was sufficient to completely block 
 <italic class="italic">V
  <sub class="sub">CAP</sub>
 </italic> after 30 min of incubation and this effect was latter reverted by 30 min of drug removal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2(A)</xref>). In fact, 500 μg/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO practically reached is maximum effect with only 15 min of incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2(B)</xref>). At 100 μg/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO, we observed that 
 <italic class="italic">V
  <sub class="sub">CAP</sub>
 </italic> was reduced to 10.6 ± 3.6, 31.4 ± 11.3, and 58.1 ± 16.8% from control, after 5, 15, and 30 min of incubation, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2(B)</xref>). Vehicle alone did not induce any significant change in the CAP characteristics (data not shown).
