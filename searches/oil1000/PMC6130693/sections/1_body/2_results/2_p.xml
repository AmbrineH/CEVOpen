<p class="p">We stated that the oxygenated monoterpene carvacrol (
 <italic class="italic">ca.</italic> 80%) strongly characterizes the 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO being its major constituent. The two monoterpene hydrocarbons, namely 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (
 <italic class="italic">ca.</italic> 4.4%) and Î³-terpinene (
 <italic class="italic">ca.</italic> 3.7%) biosynthetically correlated to carvacrol, were the other two main components, although in lower concentrations (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Finally, among the other components, only the sesquiterpene caryophyllene reaches an appreciable amount (
 <italic class="italic">ca.</italic> 2.3%).
