<p class="p">Recently, several studies have reported the antinociceptive activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus</italic> sp. extracts and their major constituents (Mahmoudi et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). In this way, we evaluated whether 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO also induces analgesy 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>. For that, the glutamate-induced nociception model was performed in mice pretreated with 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO by the oral tract, in order to imply that the drug was absorbed 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>. Our data demonstrated significant analgesic activity and dose-dependency of 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO (
