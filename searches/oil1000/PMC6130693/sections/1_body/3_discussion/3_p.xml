<p class="p">At the peripheral level, the glutamate is involved in nociceptive transmission through primary afferent fibres, as well as in the development and maintenance of the pain response (Osikowicz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Bardoni 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This amino acid acts on ionotropic receptors such as 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-methyl-
 <sc class="sc">d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA), increasing cation influx, like Na
 <sup class="sup">+ </sup>or Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>, through plasma membrane, activating post-synaptic transmission and deflagrating action potentials in nociceptive fibres, leading to pain sensation (Beirith et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that the constituents of
