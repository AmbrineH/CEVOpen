<p class="p">On the other hand, the voltage-gated K
 <sup class="sup">+ </sup>channels are believed to be an important factor in the repolarization phase of peripheral nerves, especially the delayed rectifier potassium channel (K
 <sub class="sub">v</sub>). Some studies have demonstrated that the time constant of depolarization (

  <sub class="sub">rep</sub>

 <sub class="sub">v</sub> blockers (Alves et al.
