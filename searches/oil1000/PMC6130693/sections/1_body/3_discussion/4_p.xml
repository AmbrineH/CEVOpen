<p class="p">To assess the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO on the isolated nerve excitability, we performed the single sucrose technique. This method enables the study of bioactive compounds on the peripheral nerve by measuring the CAP evoked by external electrodes (Alves et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). According to the presented data, we have demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO impede nervous transmission by blocking the CAP amplitude, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (

 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO did not damage the nerve fibres functionality during the experimentation period.
