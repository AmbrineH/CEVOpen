<p class="p">The CAP recording is considered the algebraic sum of the action potential from all individual fibres of the nerve. Their shapes and properties indicate a single-action potential and therefore it can be a useful tool for an initial searching of neuroactive drug candidates. It has also been shown that inhibition of neuronal excitability, observed as a decrease in the CAP amplitude, might be associated with the blockade of the voltage-gated Na
 <sup class="sup">+ </sup>channels (Na
 <sub class="sub">v</sub>), which are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in neurons (Araújo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The present study demonstrated that 100 μg/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO delayed the CAP depolarization phase (
 <italic class="italic">DV
  <sub class="sub">CAP</sub>
 </italic>) after 30 min-incubation in rat sciatic nerves. Thus, we can suggest a Na
 <sub class="sub">v</sub> blocking-like effect promoted by 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO in a reversible manner, since this effect was recovered by drug washout (

 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO, to induce Na
 <sub class="sub">v</sub> blockade in DRG neurons (Joca et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Those findings corroborate our results and strongly suggest that carvacrol is the main active molecule behind the antinociceptive effects of 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic>.
