<p class="p">The essential oils (EO) are volatile molecules generated by the secondary metabolism of higher plants and are produced by specialized secretory structures, such as glandular hairs and differentiated parenchyma cells (Lane et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). EO constituents belong mainly to two chemical groups: terpenoids (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes of low molecular weight) and, to a lesser extent, phenylpropanoids (Regnault-Roger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). These EO also have shown many biological activities, such as analgesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties (Faturi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Pergolizzi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Almeida et al.
