  <bold class="bold">Context:</bold> The essential oil (EO) from 
  <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic> Hoff. et Link. (Lamiaceae) has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Objective:</bold> Characterize the constituents from 
  <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO and further evaluate the antinociceptive activity by 
  <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> procedures.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Materials and methods:</bold> Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify the constituents of the 
  <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO. The antinociceptive activity was evaluated 
  <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> by the glutamate-induced nociception model in male Swiss mice (25 g), at doses of 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg, 1 h before evaluation of the licking time response (0–15 min). The mechanism of 
  <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO (1–500 μg/mL) on the isolated nerve excitability of Wistar rat (300 g) was assessed by the single sucrose technique.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Results and discussion:</bold> The EO of 
  <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> presented 33 components, mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, carvacrol (
  <italic class="italic">ca.</italic> 80%) was its major constituent. 
  <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO induced antinociception in orally treated mice (3, 6, and 12 mg/kg) reducing the licking time from control (100.3 ± 11.9 s) to 84.8 ± 12.2, 62.7.6 ± 9.9, and 41.5 ± 12.7 s, respectively (
  <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 8; 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, we have demonstrated that 
  <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO (500 μg/mL) decreased the compound action potential amplitude (
  <italic class="italic">V
   <sub class="sub">CAP</sub>
  </italic>) of about 80.0 ± 4.3% from control recordings (
  <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4; 
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Such activity was presumably mediated through a voltage-gated Na
  <sup class="sup">+ </sup>channels.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Conclusions:</bold> The present study demonstrated the antinociceptive activity of 
  <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic> essential oil, which acts via peripheral nervous excitability blockade.
