   <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO reversibly blocks the peripheral nerve excitability. (A) Representative CAP recordings obtained by the single sucrose gap technique after 5, 15 and 30 min of 
   <italic class="italic">T. capitatus</italic> EO (500 μg/mL) incubation. After drug incubation, the nerve was washed out with the physiological solution for 30 min. Control records were obtained when sciatic nerves were submitted to the physiological solution only. Stimulation parameters were 6–10 V/0.1 ms. (B) Time- and concentration-dependent effects of
