<p class="p">The results of the EO content analysis in different LPCP treatments are presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. As it can be seen, the LPCP had a significant effect on EO content (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). For example, after 1 min of LPCP treatment, the EO content increased by 36.7% compared to the control (0.9 ml/100 g D.M.); however, the 3‐ and 5‐min treatments (0.93 and 0.87 ml/100 g D.M., respectively) did not show any significant difference from control. In other words, by extending LPCP treatment duration from 1 to 5 min, EO content was significantly decreased. These results were in accordance with other researchers observations. For instance, Kodama, Thawatchaipracha, and Sekiguchi (
 <xref rid="fsn3876-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported that plasma treatment increased the EO yield of lemon peel, while longer plasma treatment time boosted the evaporation of EO components during the treatment, which resulted in lower amounts of EOs. Cold plasma treatment may cause changes in the physical surface properties of the product that leads to porosity. Scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of fissures and depressions on the surface of product after exposure to cold plasma. These surface changes are believed to provide routes for faster EO evaporation (Kodama et al.,
