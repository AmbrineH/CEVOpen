<p class="p">The constituents of lemon verbena EOs in all treatments could be classified into these following chemical groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>): monoterpene hydrocarbons (9.7%–15.1%), oxygenated monoterpenes (53.6%–69.4%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (7.3%–9.4%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (11%–16.4%). The highest amount of oxygenated monoterpenes (69.4%) was observed in the control samples, but the maximum amount of other chemical groups was obtained for LPCP‐treated samples. In other words, the effectiveness of LPCP on EO was demonstrated in terms of its quality and quantity. Kodama et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3876-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported that plasma treatments had a significant effect on citrus EO composition, and limonene, γ‐terpinene, and β‐pinene in the EO were reduced. It was observed that the highest amount of main compounds was obtained in 1‐min plasma treatment. The oxidation and damaged oil glands were identified as the main reasons for this phenomenon. Hertwig, Reineke, Ehlbeck, Knorr, et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3876-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) reported that the amount of piperine in cold plasma‐treated black pepper was only slightly lower than the amount determined in the untreated one. The results revealed that pepper quality was relatively unaffected by cold plasma treatments (after 15 and 30 min). It seems our findings are in line with the existing studies about the impact of cold plasma (either positive or negative) on the quality of agricultural products (Bußler et al.,

These considerable outcomes could be attributed to the differences in plant species, type, and duration of cold plasma treatment, the feed gas used, the applied voltages, plant secretory structures, and chemical composition of active substances (Mir et al.,
