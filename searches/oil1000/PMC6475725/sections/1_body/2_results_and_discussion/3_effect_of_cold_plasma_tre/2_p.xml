<p class="p">Based on our observations, 24 different compounds were recognized in the EOs of 
 <italic class="italic">L. citriodora</italic> which were affected by LPCP treatments. The chemical compounds of the EOs are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The main constituents of the EO in all treatments were geranial, neral, limonene, 1,8‐cineole, and globulol. It was revealed that LPCP treatments caused some variation in the main components of EO that alters the chemical profiles of lemon verbena EO (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The greatest concentration (59.2%) of citral (geranial + neral) was observed in the control samples, and the lowest amount (41.9%) was measured in the samples treated for 3 min of LPCP. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed on other LPCP treatments (43.7% and 44.2% for 1‐ and 5‐min LPCP treatments, respectively). Apart from citral, LPCP treatments also showed some effects on other compounds. For example, the limonene, 1,8‐cineole, and γ‐elemene contents were slightly increased (7.3%, 2.6%, and 2.9% compared to the control) after 3 min of LPCP treatment. The maximum amounts of spathulenol and globulol were observed after 5 min of LPCP treatment (8.1% and 7.3%, respectively).
