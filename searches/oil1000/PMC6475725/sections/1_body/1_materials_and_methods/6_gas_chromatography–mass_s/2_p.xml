<p class="p">Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was conducted with a Varian 3400 GC connected to a mass spectrometer Saturn model, equipped with a DB‐5‐fused silica capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness); the injection chamber temperature and the transfer line were set at 260 and 270°C, respectively. The carrier gas was helium with a linear velocity of 31.5 cm/s, split ratio of 1 to 60, 1 s of scan time, and mass range of 40–300 a.m.u. The oven temperature adjustment program was the same as the one mentioned for GC. The constituents of the EO were determined by calculating their retention indices and comparing related mass spectra with those registered in a computer library or the ones reported in the literature. To meet quantification purposes, relative area percentages obtained by FID were used without the use of correction factors (Adams,
