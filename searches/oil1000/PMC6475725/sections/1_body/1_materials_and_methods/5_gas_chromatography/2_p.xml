<p class="p">Gas chromatography (GC) analysis was carried out with a Thermo‐UFM (Ultra‐fast model, Italy) gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and a Ph‐5‐fused silica column (10 m × 0.1 mm; 0.4 μm film thickness). The oven temperature was held constant at 60°C for 5 min and then programmed a rate of 80°C/min to 285°C. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min; injector and detector temperatures were 280°C. The percentages of compounds were measured making use of the area normalization method, without considering response factors (Sefidkon, Abbasi, Jamzad, &amp; Ahmadi,
