<p class="p">Medicinal and aromatic plants are traded worldwide and usually consist of dried plant parts, which are naturally contaminated. Contamination with microorganisms is one of the most common problems of spices (Thongphasuk &amp; Thongphasuk, 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Many spices are cultivated and harvested in poor sanitary conditions, laying the groundwork for potential microbial contamination (McKee, 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Also, the initial microbial load of spices depends on the conditions of production, harvesting, and initial processing, such as drying (Ebadi, Sefidkon, Azizi, &amp; Ahmadi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Hertwig, Reineke, Ehlbeck, Erdoğdu, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3876-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Some microorganisms are known human pathogens, requiring methods of disinfection which minimize potential damage to active substances. It should be noted that the use of contaminated spices can reduce the longevity of their by‐products and may even cause health risks to consumers (Hertwig, Reineke, Ehlbeck, Erdoğdu, et al.,
