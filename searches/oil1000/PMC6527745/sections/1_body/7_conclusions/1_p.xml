<p class="p">The effectiveness of EOs in poultry has not been clearly defined yet. Product advantages have been noted in several studies, but studies also exist that display no impact on FCR or BWG. Other advantages of EOs include the potentially improved flavor of the carcass, antioxidant capacity, and improved feed digestibility. There is also evidence that EOs can be utilized 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> to impact pathogen concentrations, including 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>. However, this depends largely on the EO utilized as the mechanism(s) of action are not well-defined. With over 300 commercially available EOs, precisely elucidating the underlying mechanisms may prove difficult (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bajpai et al., 2012</xref>). Less information is available regarding the mechanistic role of EOs used 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>. Their potential ability to improve amino acid absorption in the ileum may allow for generating a GIT environment unfavorable to 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> in the ceca due to diminished substrate availability, which is further downstream. To fully elucidate the impact EOs have on 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> concentrations 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic>, further research on the mechanism(s) and effects of EOs must be performed.
