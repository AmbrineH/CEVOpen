<p class="p">Microencapsulation may also be utilized (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calo et al., 2015</xref>). Microencapsulation is a process in which liquid particles are surrounded in polymeric compounds (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bansode et al., 2010</xref>). Typical water-soluble coating materials can include gelatin, gum arabic, and polyacrylic acid (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jyothi et al., 2012</xref>). The intention of microencapsulation with preharvest remediation techniques is to prevent the therapeutic compound from absorption before reaching the target area within the GIT (
 <xref rid="B296" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Immerseel et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, 
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pan et al. (2014)</xref> found that encapsulated thymol inhibited pathogens more effectively in milk due to enhanced solubility. As such, microencapsulated EOs have been suggested as a methodology for improving the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> effects of EOs (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Calo et al., 2015</xref>). Utilizing a feed-based microencapsulated blend of thymol and eugenol, along with propionic and sorbic acids, 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grilli et al. (2013)</xref> was able to reduce 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> in layer hens. During a 42-day trial, birds were provided this blend, labeled CTR, at varying concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0%), and were infected with 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/mL 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> on day 22. 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> concentrations were measured by plating cecal contents onto modified Charcoal-Cefoperazone-Deoxycholate Agar (mCCDA). The CTR blend was effective in reducing 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> at all concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0%) on days 35 and 43, with 1% CTR exhibiting a 5 log CFU/g reduction at day 42 compared to the control. At day 42 the 0.1% concentration reduced 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> populations by 3 log CFU/g. In a second experiment utilizing either 0.1 or 0.3% of this blend, birds were given either the blend before or after the day 22 infection with 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>. Statistically significant reductions were still observed within each treatment group, except with 0.1% CTR at day 35, but the reductions were significantly lower for the group given the treatment after infection instead of before. The CTR blend at a concentration of 0.3% given from day 0 to 21 reduced 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> by 1.5 log CFU/g at day 35 where 3 log CFU/g reductions were observed when the 0.3% CTR blend was applied on day 22. However, in a cecal loop model study by 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hermans et al. (2011a)</xref>, involving direct injection of the trans-cinnamaldehyde into ceca infected with 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> they failed to detect significant reductions in 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> concentrations. This indicates that the absorption of the EOs in the upper GIT is not the only reason for variation between 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> trials (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arsi et al., 2014</xref>). Further experiments utilizing microencapsulation of combined EO blends, along with comparisons with their unencapsulated counterparts, is necessary to determine the specific effectiveness of utilizing microencapsulation.
