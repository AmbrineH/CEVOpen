<p class="p">There appears to be inconsistency in responses of birds infected by 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> when administered EOs compared to 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> responses as well as among individual bird trials. Understanding the underlying factors and potential limitations may give insight into how EOs can be applied in the future. One primary limitation of EOs is that they can be rapidly absorbed in the GIT (
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meunier et al., 2006</xref>). This rapid absorption has been observed in pigs and humans (

 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meunier et al., 2006</xref>). Absorption by the stomach and small intestine before they can affect cecal concentrations may be occuring in 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arsi et al., 2014</xref>). To test this potential limitation, intestinal absorption resistant EOs derivatives can be applied. Thymol-Î²-d-glucopyranoside is more resistant to intestinal absorption than thymol and has been shown to have similar antimicrobial effects 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Epps et al., 2015</xref>). However, while a 1 log reduction of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> was observed in the crops of market-aged broilers with this absorption-resistant compound, no significant impacts were found in the ceca with either thymol-based treatment (
