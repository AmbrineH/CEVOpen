<p class="p">Additionally, the observed reductions using blends of EOs can help reduce the incidence of

For instance, increasing the concentrations of certain members of the GIT microbiome through EOs may generate a GIT less suitable or more hostile for initial 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> colonization (

 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic>, the microbiome, and EOs remediation are fully elucidated a more targeted remediation technique may be possible. For instance, specific EOs blends could be designed to modulate the microbiome to prevent 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> colonization. While 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> EOs application may not be able to eliminate 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> concentrations at the time of slaughter, it does provide a hurdle that the bacteria must overcome before contamination of the final product (
