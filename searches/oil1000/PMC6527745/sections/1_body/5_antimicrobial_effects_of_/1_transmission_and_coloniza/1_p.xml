<p class="p">The use of EOs in pre-harvest environments has focused on preventing pathogen colonization or reducing their concentration in the GIT (

 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> resides in the intestinal mucosa of the avian GIT and can be rapidly transmitted throughout a flock via the drinking water and fecal-oral route (

 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Keener et al., 2004</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> virulence factors that impact colonization include, 
 <italic class="italic">motA, fliA, jlpA</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">racR</italic> and were discussed in 
 <xref rid="B292" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Upadhyay et al. (2017)</xref> and reviewed in 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bolton (2015)</xref>. While there is still controversy over how and when 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> colonize the ceca, the most common route is believed to be horizontal transmission throughout the flock (

 <xref rid="B263" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Silva et al., 2011</xref>). Vertical transmission has been reported from parent to fertile egg and studies have detected 35% inoculation of the progeny (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cox et al., 2010</xref>). However, in a study with 60,000 progeny-parent breeders there was no evidence of vertical transmission, and therefore more emphasis is placed on 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> colonization occurring through horizontal or environmental transmission (

 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> can spread through water supplies, insects, litter, rodents, fecal content, and from bird to bird contact (

 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> colonization is usually detected at approximately 3 weeks of age and with concentrations rapidly reaching 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/g (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corry and Atabay, 2001</xref>). The ceca, containing up to 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> CFU/g, contains the largest concentration of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> within the avian GIT due to the abundance of nutrients, including amino acids, and the temperature in the avian ceca being approximately 42Â°C, which is optimal for

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duke, 1986</xref>). This site is an important consideration for food safety as the ceca may rupture during poultry processing leading to contamination of the finished poultry product if not properly handled (
