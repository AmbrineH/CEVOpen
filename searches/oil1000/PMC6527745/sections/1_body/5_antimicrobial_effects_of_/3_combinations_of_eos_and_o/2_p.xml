 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gracia et al. (2015)</xref> evaluated the effectiveness of a 0.03% blend of thymol, eugenol, piperine, and benzoic acid or 0.08% garlic oil. Chickens were inoculated with 0.1 mL of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> at day 14 by 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gracia et al. (2015)</xref>. On days 21 to 42, birds in treatment groups were administered the EOs benzoic acid blend or garlic oil. In the control groups, 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> populations were 7.33 and 7.38 log CFU/g. In the treatment group with the EOs blend, concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> were 7.66 log CFU/g, and in the garlic oil treatment, 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> concentrations were 7.26 log CFU/g. Both these treatments were not able to statistically reduce
