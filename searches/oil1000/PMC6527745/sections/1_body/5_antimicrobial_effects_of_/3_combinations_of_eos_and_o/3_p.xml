<p class="p">An OA and EO treatment combination was administered to broilers by 
 <xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thibodeau et al. (2014)</xref>. This blend contained sorbate, fumarate, and thymol. Sorbate has been demonstrated to disrupt the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and lower pH of the GIT, while fumarate indirectly affects intestinal bacteria by lowering the pH of the stomach (

 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> (designated #1 and 2). One, two, and three weeks after inoculation 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> concentrations were enumerated in the ceca and on the whole carcass post-processing. This experiment was repeated using a different set of strains (3 and 4) with lower adhesion properties. In the trial with strains 1 and 2, counts of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> were not significantly different when compared to the control. In the trial with strains 3 and 4, cecal populations were significantly higher 3 weeks after inoculation by approximately 1.5 log CFU/g, but carcass rinses were significantly lower by approximately 2 log CFU/mL. This suggests the adhesion properties may impact the efficacy of the EO treatment, however other variations between the strains may be impacting the results. These adhesion properties are necessary for binding to the intestinal cell wall within poultry, which may also be impacted by EOs (
