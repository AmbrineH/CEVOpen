<p class="p">One mechanism for bacterial adhesion to the poultry GIT is through lectin-carbohydrate receptors (

 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> without CadF protein synthesis capabilities are unable to produce a lectin protein that specifically binds to fibronectin (

 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rubinchik et al., 2012</xref>). CadF is a membrane-bound protein that mediates the binding of

 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Piva and Rossi (1998)</xref> postulated that oligosaccharides, such as mannan-oligosaccharides, would bind to enterocyte receptors on pathogenic cell walls which would also prevent colonization (
