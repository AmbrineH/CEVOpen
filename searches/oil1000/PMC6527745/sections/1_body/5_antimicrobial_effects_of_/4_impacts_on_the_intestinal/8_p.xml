 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic> has also been known to produce SCFAs that can reduce 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> populations (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Awad et al., 2018</xref>). When SCFAs were tested 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic>, butyrate was determined to be bactericidal toward 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> at a concentration of 12.5 mM, and acetate and propionate were bacteriostatic at 50 mM (
 <xref rid="B295" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Van Deun et al., 2008</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> has been demonstrated to produce acetate as a by-product of serine catabolism and utilize it as an energy source, which could explain the variation between it and butyrate inhibition (

 <xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stahl et al., 2012</xref>). This does not explain the variation between propionate and butyrate. While it has been demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> can metabolize acetate and the OA lactate, no known pathways have been elucidated for the transport or metabolism of propionate or butyrate (
