 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter jejuni-</italic>infected broilers in a seeder model that were given feed coated in 0.3% trans-cinnamaldehyde did not exhibit any significant reduction in 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> cecal populations after 1 week (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hermans et al., 2011a</xref>). In this model, six pens were set up each containing nine chickens with half of the pens receiving cinnamaldehyde. At day 15, three chicks per pen were given 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL of 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> KC 40. At day 21, the chickens were euthanized. All ceca within the treatment groups contained 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic>. When the cecal populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> were averaged per pen, significant differences between treatment and control group were not observed. Cinnamaldehyde degrades quickly in the upper GIT of piglets, and this may explain the lack of differences within the populations for the chicken-based studies as well (
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Michiels et al., 2008</xref>). A commercial blend of garlic and cinnamon, Alliin Plus (Orffa, Werkendam, Netherlands), was found to cause a 1 log CFU/g reduction of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> cecal counts 3 days post-infection (day 11) but no significant effects were detected on day 35 or day 42 (
