 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arsi et al. (2014)</xref> investigated the use of thymol, carvacrol, or a combination, as a feed amendment to prevent 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> colonization. Ten birds per treatment were inoculated on day 3 with a 5-strain mixture of 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> that were previously isolated from chicken ceca and susceptible to ciprofloxacin or fluoroquinolone. Birds were euthanized on day 10. Cecal 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> counts were enumerated using 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> Line agar (
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Line, 2001</xref>) and confirmed using latex agglutination. Individual strains were not distinguished. Four trials were performed of this experiment with the only difference between trials was the inclusion of a 2% (Trials 1 and 2) or 0.125% treatment group and the use of EO combinations (Trials 3 and 4). While significant reductions of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> in the 0.25% thymol, 2% thymol, 1% carvacrol, and 0.5% thymol and carvacrol treatments existed, these reductions were not observed across all trials and were not detected in birds fed other concentrations. Thymol, at a concentration of 0.25%, reduced 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> by 0.6 log CFU/mL cecal contents during only one trial out of four. A 2 log CFU reduction was observed with 2% thymol for only one trial out of two. Additionally, 2 log CFU/mL cecal contents were observed for one trial using 0.5% thymol and carvacrol, but this was not repeated.
