 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> contamination on poultry products is one of the more common causes of campylobacteriosis in humans (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Keener et al., 2004</xref>). Incidence rates in a study of 425 broiler carcasses over 12 months revealed 87.5% of the post-chill carcasses were contaminated with

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bashor et al., 2004</xref>). As such, to prevent cross-contamination, it is vital that carcass rinses and sprays be applied as appropriate sanitation techniques. Essential oils may serve as an alternative sanitizer for processing washes.
