<p class="p">Other studies reported similar inhibitory and bacteriostatic effects of oregano, eucalyptus, marigold, ginger, jasmine, cedarwood, carrot, mugwort, bergamot, and other EOs, against 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> and other foodborne pathogens (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Friedman et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreira et al., 2005</xref>;

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Friedman et al. (2002)</xref> tested 119 EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni, E. coli</italic> O157:H7
 <italic class="italic">, L. monocytogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">S. enterica</italic> in PBS for 60 min at 37°C (42°C for 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic>) followed by plating on appropriate media for each species, including an iron-supplemented Brucella agar for 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni.</italic> The EO concentration that resulted in the bactericidal activity of a 50% CFU decrease relative to the control was determined for each EO bacterial species combination. Marigold taegetes (0.003%), ginger root (0.005%), jasmine (0.006%), patchouli (0.007%), and gardenia (0.007%) were the most effective oils against 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> RM1221 followed by cedarwood (0.0075%), carrot seed (0.0078%), celery seed (0.0085%), mugwort (0.009%), spikenard (0.009%), and orange bitter oils (0.009%). In this study, 39 EOs were tested against all four foodborne pathogens. When their bactericidal activities were averaged, the five most effective EOs were cinnamaldehyde (0.03%), thymol (0.05%), Spanish oregano (0.05%), carvacrol (0.06%), and 
 <italic class="italic">Oregano origanum</italic> (0.06%). Of these five EOs, 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> was impacted the most by the lowest percent concentration compared to the other tested foodborne pathogens.
