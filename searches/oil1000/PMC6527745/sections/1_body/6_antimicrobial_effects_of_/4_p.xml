<p class="p">This suggests that not only may 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> be a prime target for EO remediation, but EO that have not been extensively tested may be more optimal candidates to utilize, such as marigold and jasmine. Disk diffusion methods indicated that lemon, sweet orange and bergamot were effective against 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli</italic> O157:H7, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fisher and Phillips, 2006</xref>). Each oil was added to a 2 cm disk and then placed on agar plates in the presence of the bacteria of interest, with 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> SR 117 being plated on 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> agar base with 5% horse blood and incubated at 42Â°C. No zones of inhibition were detected for 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> when orange or citral was added. Bergamot produced a zone of inhibition of 23 mm, and lemon produced a zone of inhibition of 18 mm, which were the smallest zones compared to the other tested bacteria. The zone of inhibition for linalool was greater than 90 mm. The MIC was also determined for bergamot (greater than 4%), lemon (greater than 4%), and linalool (0.06%). While no zone of inhibition was visually detected for orange oil by

 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> (
 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thanissery et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fisher and Phillips (2006)</xref>, a disk diffusion test was performed using thyme, orange, rosemary, clove, and a 1:1 ratio of thyme and orange oil. This was tested on 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> 11601 MD, 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> RM1221, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. coli</italic> RM2228 along with a cocktail of the three strains. No visible growth on disk diffusion assay across all strains and in the cocktail was visualized when exposed to thyme or clove. For the cocktail, orange oil, rosemary, and the combination of thyme and orange oil produced zones of inhibition of 17, 11, and 20 mm, respectively. A macro-broth dilution assay was also performed using Mueller Hinton broth to determine the MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of these oils. However, the exact MIC and MBC was not determined as 0.0008% concentrations of the oils were sufficient for inhibiting bacterial growth.
