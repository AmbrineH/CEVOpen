 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>). Thymol and geraniol reduced 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium difficile</italic> in feces at 500 ppm, which was five times the concentration utilized for a significant reduction in pure cultures. When 0.16 mg/mL of rosemary oil, consisting of carnosic acid, carnosol, and rosmarinic acid was applied in the laboratory, a 2 log CFU/mL reduction in 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> was observed in Mueller-Hinton broth when the initial concentration was at 7 log CFU/mL (

 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Piskernik et al., 2011</xref>). However, four times the concentration was needed to achieve the same reduction in chicken meat juice, isolated from thawed previously frozen carcasses, unless supplemented with nisin, a bacteriocin (

 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Piskernik et al. (2011)</xref>, it was suggested that lipids and proteins within the juice matrix might have partly inhibited the EO therapy. 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burt (2004)</xref> suggested that the decreased EO effectiveness in the food matrix compared to the broth experiment may be because in an oil-in-water emulsion that allows the bacteria to grow as films and in colonies, which can shield interior cells from therapeutics. As a consequence, while 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> laboratory models are important, to elucidate the potential impact of EOs, poultry product matrices as well as processing environments must be considered.
