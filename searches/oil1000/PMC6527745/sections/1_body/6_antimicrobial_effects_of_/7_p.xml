<p class="p">Other factors may confound EO efficacy toward 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> in poultry products. For example, one major concern for poultry industries is the ability for pathogens to form biofilms (
 <xref rid="B269" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Srey et al., 2013</xref>). Biofilms are bacterial communities within a polysaccharide matrix that can readily form and attach on processing surfaces (

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Donlan and Costerton, 2002</xref>). Biofilms can be difficult to remove by antimicrobials and processing sanitizers such as chlorine and peracetic acid, which are commonly used in the industry (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deborde and Von Gunten, 2008</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> is known to form biofilms on stainless steel, polystyrene, and glass (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gunther and Chen, 2009</xref>). Coriander oil and its antimicrobial component linalool were found to affect biofilm formation of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> planktonic cells and pre-established biofilms (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duarte et al., 2016</xref>). When coriander and linalool were used at 2 μg/mL (approximately four times the MIC) 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. coli</italic> biofilms were reduced in size by 70 to 80% after 48-h incubation in a crystal violet assay (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duarte et al., 2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Even when using half the MIC, coriander, and linalool reduced the biofilm by 20 to 25% (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duarte et al., 2016</xref>). Results of biofilm inhibition varied more wildly from planktonic cells, but all concentrations (0.025 to 2 μg/mL) successfully inhibited biofilm growth compared to the control, with linalool reducing some biofilm formation between 10 and 20% of the control (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Duarte et al., 2016</xref>). Thyme, oregano, and cinnamon EOs, when used at concentrations below the MIC, were also found effective against biofilms of 
 <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Stenotrophomonas</italic> spp. that were isolated from biofilms within the food industry (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Szczepanski and Lipski, 2014</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Sphingomonas</italic> biofilms were reduced by 50% by thyme oil at a concentration of 0.001% where the MIC was 0.008% (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Szczepanski and Lipski, 2014</xref>). Similar results were found using thyme and balsam on 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> biofilms (
