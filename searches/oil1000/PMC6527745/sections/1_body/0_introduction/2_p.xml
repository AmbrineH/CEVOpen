<p class="p">In a population-based study on patients with diarrheal illness induced by 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>, over 95% of the 1,316 cases were caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter jejuni</italic> (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Friedman et al., 2004</xref>). This species, along with pathogen 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter coli</italic>, have been found in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of poultry (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017b</xref>). Broilers and layer flocks have consistently been shown to contain 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> prevalences greater than 70% (

 <xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schets et al. (2017)</xref> found that 97% of layer and 93% of broiler flocks tested positive for 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>. Across eight flocks in the Netherlands, 55 cecal samples were taken and found that 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> was the 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> isolate for 100% of cecal broiler samples where in layer hens 52% were 
 <italic class="italic">C. coli</italic>, 40% were 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> (40%) and 7% were 
 <italic class="italic">C. lari</italic>. Identical sequence types were found in the soil, sediment, and surface water which indicates potential contamination of the bird through environmental means. Through contamination of the poultry carcass, 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> can cause foodborne illness and has been the etiological agent in outbreaks caused by poultry products (
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nauta et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Geissler and Powers, 2011</xref>). Therefore there is a continued urgency to implement pre- and post-harvest technologies to prevent 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> contamination at all stages of poultry production.
