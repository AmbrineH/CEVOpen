<p class="p">Additionally, the sensory characteristics of EOs mean that they can enhance the sensory characteristics of the final products if used in the appropriate concentrations. The addition of 300 mg/kg of oregano, garlic, or an equal combination in the diets was shown to significantly improve the flavor of frozen chicken breasts up to 60 days (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kirkpinar et al., 2014</xref>). Birds fed the EOs were processed, and the breasts were stored at -25°C for sensory analysis. Overall flavor evaluated on days 1, 15, and 30 indicated that all EOs treatments scored significantly higher than the control. Overall acceptability scores of breast meat indicated that only garlic resulted in a more palatable final product on days 1, 15, and 30. Overall acceptability scores were based on flavor, appearance, and tenderness. Days 45 and 60 scores were not analyzed statistically due to spoilage. On organic seabass filets, the addition of 0.2% thyme oil improved the sensory characteristics (
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kostaki et al., 2009</xref>). A panel of seven judges evaluated the filets on nine days within a 21-day storage trial where the filets were held at -30°C. While the control group reached the acceptability limit on taste in 6 days the addition of 0.2% thyme improved the sensory characteristics scores extending shelf life by 2 days. When the filets were placed in modified atmospheric packaging (MAP) (60% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; 30% N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; 10% O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), sensory characteristics were improved to allow for a shelf life of 14 days. When thyme oil was added to the MAP, shelf life was extended by 3 days. Despite these potential benefits, their antimicrobial activities might be some of their more important attributes to commercial poultry production.
