<p class="p">Additionally, the feed may play a major role in how EOs improve FCR. As elucidated in 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jamroz et al. (2003)</xref>, EOs can impact the absorption of amino acids and potentially other nutrients in the ileum. As a consequence, the FCR should be improved in birds on typical commercial diets amended with EOs. Furthermore, improved absorption of amino acids could conceivably also allow for the use of non-conventional diets that contain less protein. In-depth studies employing not only commercial bird performance measurements but intestinal pathway and tissue profiling to screen and compare feed composition and EO blend combinations would be necessary to address this hypothesis.
