 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Economou et al. (1991)</xref> also found that combinations of thyme and marjoram and thyme and spearmint EOs also had potential synergistic properties in protecting lard from oxidation. These properties benefit bird health and can be marketable if EOs are used on the finished product (
