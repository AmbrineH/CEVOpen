<p class="p">Finally, while terpenoids are the main constituents of EOs, their chemistry can vary widely (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jager, 2010</xref>). For instance, carvacrol is a monoterpene alcohol and, in rats, its aliphatic group readily undergo aromatic hydroxylation while its alcohol group undergoes carboxylation (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Austgulen et al., 1987</xref>). This suggests, in rats, that carvacrol undergoes chemical interactions and is metabolized more than thymol. This functional difference between EO metabolism, along with the importance of bird type and feed composition, may in part explain the variation in EOs benefit to broiler nutrition.
