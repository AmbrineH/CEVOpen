<p class="p">There are indirect characteristics associated with the presence of EOs that may play a role in reducing 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> and other pathogen loads on the final poultry meat product. While no definitive mechanism has been elucidated, there have been several potential antimicrobial outcomes that may indirectly impact 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>. For instance, the improved ileal absorption of amino acids within broilers, as demonstrated by 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jamroz et al. (2003)</xref>, may limit a required nutrient source for 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> in the ceca (
 <xref rid="B299" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Velayudhan et al., 2004</xref>). Improvement of the immune response may also impact pathogen concentrations (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). Layer hens exhibited improved antibody titer levels to Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease when their diets were supplemented with Heryumix
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> (
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Özek et al., 2011</xref>). In another study with Heryumix
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup>, the humoral immune response of layer hens in heat stress was not stimulated (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Basmacioğlu Malayoğlu et al. (2010)</xref>, noted that broilers fed 0, 250, or 500 mg/kg of oregano exhibited IgG concentrations of 27.42, 30.50, and 39.41 mg/dL, respectively. The IgM concentrations were 7.91, 9.58, and 11.71 mg/dL, respectively (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Basmacioğlu Malayoğlu et al., 2010</xref>). However, while these concentrations of antibodies were higher, they were not statistically significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Basmacioğlu Malayoğlu et al., 2010</xref>). As such, further research should be conducted to elucidate the mechanism(s) of EOs on the poultry immune system. Understanding how EOs improve the immune system of poultry may be important because 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> colonization may elicit an immune response, and therefore there is potential to reduce 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> concentrations through immune system modulation (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Connerton et al., 2018</xref>). Essential oils may also interact with 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> populations directly.
