<p class="p">Essential oils have also been shown to impact Gram-positive organisms (
 <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Si et al., 2006</xref>). Cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, only when used in combination, were shown to inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus, Micrococcus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moleyar and Narasimham, 1992</xref>). Moreover, when considering the 300 commercially viable EOs, it is quite likely not all EOs may operate under the same mechanism (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). They may even operate in concert with a series of mechanisms that represent contradictory activities against bacterial cellular processes. While some EOs blends promote the growth of beneficial bacteria others have inhibited beneficial bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Lactobacillus</italic>, and even some 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kivan√ß et al., 1991</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Manzanilla et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Delaquis et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jamroz et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Donsi et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity may not be attributable to one specific mechanism (
 <xref rid="B265" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Skandamis et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carson et al., 2002</xref>). When considering all of the proposed mechanisms it seems more than likely that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the effect of EOs against pathogens including 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diaz-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, the impact of EO blends on 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> populations may vary considerably in pre and post-harvest applications.
