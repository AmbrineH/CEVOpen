<p class="p">Another proposed mechanism for the effect of EOs on bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> is their potential to disrupt the outer membrane and initiate cell lysis (
 <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oâ€™Bryan et al., 2015</xref>). Attributed largely to EOs hydrophobicity, the outer membrane lipids may be disrupted, sheared, or penetrated, allowing for an increase in permeability (

 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guinoiseau et al., 2010</xref>). Carvacrol and thymol, in 200 mg/L concentrations, have been demonstrated to inhibit 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> through fluorescent flow cytometry (
 <xref rid="B318" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanism proposed in this study, supported by 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Helander et al. (1998)</xref>, was that EOs disrupt the lipopolysaccharides membrane structure and alter the proton gradient (
 <xref rid="B318" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). This effect may not occur in 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> spp. due to their reliance on fermentation pathways and would have to be investigated (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Line et al., 2010</xref>). Alterations of the lipopolysaccharide membrane can still lead to disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and cell lysis (
 <xref rid="B318" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Electron microscopy has demonstrated the 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> treated with oregano oil resulted in cell membrane collapse and leakage of contents (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De Sousa et al., 2012</xref>). Cumin derived 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene has been demonstrated to swell bacterial cell membranes and has been suggested to be used synergistically with carvacrol to lyse bacterial membranes (
 <xref rid="B290" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ultee et al., 2002</xref>). Other phenolic compounds have been observed to demonstrate this effect on the bacterial membrane (
