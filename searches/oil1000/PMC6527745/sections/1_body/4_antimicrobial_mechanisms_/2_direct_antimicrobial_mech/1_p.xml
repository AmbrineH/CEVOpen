<p class="p">Much of the mechanisms associated with antimicrobial activities of EOs have been elucidated from microorganisms other than 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>, and thus assumptions regarding 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> must be inferred to some extent. General antimicrobial mechanisms associated with EOs have been extensively described previously by 
 <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Bryan et al. (2015)</xref> and will be discussed briefly in the current review with specific emphasis on 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> where applicable. Essential oils have been shown to alter proteomes and cell morphology of pathogenic bacteria (
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nazzaro et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Bryan et al., 2015</xref>). Significant morphological differences in cell shape have been observed when EOs such as mint, thymol, and cinnamaldehyde have been applied to bacteria (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kwon et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kalchayanand et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hajlaoui et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, the use of cinnamaldehyde on 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> inhibited cell division resulting in elongated filamentous cells that were clumped together with incomplete septa (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kwon et al., 2003</xref>). After 1 h, almost all cells were in filamentous chains with no clear septas. 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Thompson grown in the presence of a sub-lethal concentration of thymol (0.01%) demonstrated an altered proteomic profile compared to the control, which included downregulation of binding and chemotaxis proteins, but resulted in upregulation of other outer membrane proteins (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Di Pasqua et al., 2010</xref>). In-depth analysis using 2-D PAGE, followed by MALDI-TOF, revealed that GroEL and DnaK were upregulated in the presence of thymol. GroEL, along with GroES, as well as DnaK, along with DnaJ, prevents misfolding and proper indiscriminate assembly of polypeptides under stress conditions within the cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fenton and Horwich, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Motojima, 2015</xref>). Changes in regulation were detected by spot detection, and the relative size of the GroEL spot was 0.109 units in the control compared to a spot size of 1.044 units. The DnaK spot was not detected in the control but exhibited a size of 0.267 in the treatment with thymol. Other downregulated proteins include CheW, which is involved in transferring sensory signals from chemoreceptors to flagellar motor proteins, and thioredoxin docking proteins (Trx1). The spot size of CheW was 0.153 units and was not detected in the thymol treated cells where the Trx1 spot was 0.223 units in the control and not detected in the thymol treatment. Trx1 is an active oxidation–reduction protein that has been found to be involved in cell division in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, which suggests thymol may play a role in the inhibition of bacterial population growth (
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar et al., 2004</xref>). Trx1 refolds citrate synthase, an essential enzyme in the TCA cycle, and by downregulating Trx1 with thymol, citrate synthase was not present. In addition, enzymes of the reverse TCA cycle were upregulated in the thymol treatment such as an increase of citrate lyase from 0.08 units to 0.654. Acetate kinase was also reduced from 0.567 units to 0.19 units within 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>. These results may not be replicated in 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> due to its incomplete glycolytic pathways and studies investigating the use of EOs to alter the proteome of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> should be performed.
