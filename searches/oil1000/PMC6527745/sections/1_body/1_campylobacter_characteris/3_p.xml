 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muraoka and Zhang, 2010</xref>). This is due to the presence of a genomic island cj0480câ€“cj0490, which has been linked to an increase in virulence (

 <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stahl et al. (2011)</xref> noted that this metabolic pathway improved colonization of the piglet model for human disease indicating its importance in human-associated pathogenesis. Moreover, when the l-fucose pathway genes were mutated, 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> was still able to colonize the ceca of chickens but was outcompeted in a co-colonization experiment by the wild-type strain (
