<p class="p">Aromatic compounds can also be modified anaerobically (

 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Netzer et al., 2016</xref>). Often phenolic compounds such as chlorophenol and chlorobenzoate can be utilized as electron sinks, resulting in their reduction and modification within the lower GIT (

 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Frazer, 1994</xref>). While 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> has been shown to utilize some aromatic compounds such as resorcinol and β or γ-resorcylate, this was only shown in the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> spp. (

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Evans and Fuchs, 1988</xref>). However, other aromatic compounds can be utilized as energy sources by some bacteria (
 <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Overhage et al., 2006</xref>). MetaCyc identifies five complete aromatic degradation pathways present in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> including cinnamate, phenylethylamine, nitroaromatic, and phenols (version 22.5; BioCyc; Menlo Park, CA, United States) (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caspi et al., 2015</xref>). Chlorobenzene, paraoxon, parathion, and shikimate degradation pathways have been identified in 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and degradation of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene, along with other aromatic compounds, have been characterized in 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas</italic> spp. In 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>, only the catechol degradation pathway has been detected. Numerous biodegradation enzymes have been elucidated in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli;</italic> for instance, eugenol has been shown to be degraded to ferulic acid by the 
 <italic class="italic">vaoA</italic> gene-encoded enzymes (

 <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). However, only resorcinol, protocatechuate, and phloroglucionol degradation enzymes are known to occur in

 <xref rid="B302" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Villemur, 1995</xref>). Given the limited metabolic capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> for modification, it would be intuitive that aromatic compounds that exhibit antimicrobial properties could effectively reduce 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> populations in poultry production. This is important since aromatic compounds are one of the constituents present in phytobiotics.
