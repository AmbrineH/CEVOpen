<p class="p">Compared to other foodborne pathogens occupying the poultry GIT, 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> possesses a metabolism that is somewhat different and thus may be a challenge for some intervention strategies. 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> spp. do not utilize the traditional glycolysis pathway, instead favoring amino acids such as aspartate, glutamate, serine, and proline for their cellular respiration pathways (
 <xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stahl et al., 2012</xref>). The traditional glycolytic pathway is incomplete as genes encoding glucokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase are absent (
 <xref rid="B230" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parkhill et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, despite a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), gluconeogenesis from glucose-6-phosphate to glucose is not observed, and the genes necessary for encoding the proteins associated with the pathway are absent (
 <xref rid="B230" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parkhill et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B300" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Velayudhan and Kelly, 2002</xref>). Some of the gluconeogenesis and glycolysis genes and respective proteins are present which has led to the hypothesis that 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> can catabolize intermediary molecules (
 <xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stahl et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hofreuter et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that the presence of a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT) in 
 <italic class="italic">C. jejuni</italic> 81176 could be indicative of the breakdown of glycerol-3-phosphate to generate pyruvate and potential further breakdown through the TCA cycle. Additionally, the non-oxidative portion of the pentose pathway shunt (transaldolase, transketolase, ribulose-3-phosphate epimerase, and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase) is suggested to have the ability to metabolize pentose sugars (
