<p id="Par6" class="p">Here we go one step further and show that a hydroxyl-rich microenvironment can even drive enzymes for catalyzing water-sensitive reactions in an anhydrous gas-phase condition. We create a hydrophilic, flexible and porous matrix which can form multiple hydrogen bonds with enzymes. In an essentially water-free environment, such a matrix would allow the necessary conformational transitions of enzymes, but avoid the detrimental collision by water molecules and enable a long-term enzymatic catalysis.</p>
