<p id="Par4" class="p">From the perspective of chemical industry and engineering, gas-phase enzymatic catalysis has many unique advantages compared with conventional liquid-phase enzymatic reactions, such as the faster diffusion of reactants, higher stability of enzymes, a greener process without using solvents, and the ease of recovery and reuse of immobilized enzymes

 </sup>) in their lyophilized states can react with their gaseous substrates in the gas phase at an ultralow activity (~1% of the activity in an aqueous solution). This is one of the major barriers for the industrial practice of gas-phase enzymatic catalysis. Conventional immobilization strategy has been applied to improve the activity of enzymes in the gas phase

 </sup>, but the improvement is too little to compete with their soluble counterparts due to the structural rigidity of the dried enzymes. Another key factor in gas-phase enzymatic reaction is the water activity (
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub>), the ratio of the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere to that of the water saturation pressure at the system temperature
