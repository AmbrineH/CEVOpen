<p id="Par3" class="p">Harnessing the power of enzymes for applications in unnatural scenarios is challenging but tempting. Great efforts including chemical modification and genetic engineering have been made in the past decades to bring the enzymatic catalysis from aqueous solutions to non-aqueous media
