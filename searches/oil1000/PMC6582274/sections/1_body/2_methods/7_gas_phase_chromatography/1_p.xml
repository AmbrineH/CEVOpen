<p id="Par22" class="p">The concentration of substrates and products were analyzed by GC (Shimadzu GC-2010) equipped with a DB-5 column (30 m in length and 0.25 mm in diameter) and a FID detector. The helium flow rate was 3.5 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with a sample size of 0.3 μL and split ratio of 30:1. The temperature of injection port and detector were 270 °C and 260 °C respectively. The column was held at 150 °C for 2 min and then the temperature increased to 200 °C at 25 °C/min and then held for another 2 min. The result of every sample was an average of two tests within 5% error. The concentrations of chemicals were determined by external standard method, in which a series of different concentration of standard geraniol and vinyl acetate were tested before the analysis of substrates and products. The retention times for geraniol and vinyl acetate were 1.79 min and 2.45 min, respectively.
