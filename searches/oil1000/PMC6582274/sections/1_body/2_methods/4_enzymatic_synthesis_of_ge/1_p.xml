 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>. Initially the storage tank 1 (S1) contains 20 mL of geraniol, and tank 2 (S2) contains 20 mL of vinyl acetate. In a typical run, the N

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) carrying the vapor of substrates from the tanks S1 and S2 were first mixed in a mixing tank and then were supplied into the reactor packed with LGAs or dry CALB powder. The product was collected in a 5 ml vial containing 2 mL of n-hexane placed in a 0 °C water bath. The product composition was analyzed by gas-phase chromatography (GC) as detailed in Supplementary Information. To study the catalytic performance in the presence of H
