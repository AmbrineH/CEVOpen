 </sup>. During a run, 0.5 g of NaNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was added to a 250 mL flask containing 23 mL of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. The mixture was subjected to 5 min ultrasonication to completely solubilize the NaNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. The flask was then incubated in an ice bath with mechanical agitation at 150 rpm. Once the solution temperature was down to 0–5 °C, graphite powder of 1.0 g was added into the flask, followed by a slow addition of certain amount of KMnO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> while the reaction temperature was maintained below 10 °C. Then the flask was incubated into to an oil bath at 35 °C and vigorously stirred (250 rpm) for 30 min. 50 mL of deionized water was slowly added to the flask while the temperature of oil bath was increased to 95 °C. After 15 min incubation, the mixture was poured into 500 mL of deionized water under agitation. H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (5 mL 30%) was added dropwise until gas evolution was finished and the suspension color changed from dark brown to yellow.
