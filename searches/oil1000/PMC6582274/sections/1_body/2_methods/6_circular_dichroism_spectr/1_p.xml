<p id="Par21" class="p">Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of lipase in solution was determined on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter. For the enzyme in dry conditions, the circular dichroism spectra were examined by CD (Applied Photophysics Ltd Chirascan) with a continuous scanning mode at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C). A certain amount of lyophilized enzyme or immobilized enzyme was suspended in 5 mL pure water, and then the solution was flatted out on clean quartz slides by a dip-coating machine. The coated slides were dried completely before test. The spectra were recorded between 240 and 185 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with a resolution of 1 nm. And all spectra were corrected by subtracting the base line and averaged based on at least three scans for each sample.
