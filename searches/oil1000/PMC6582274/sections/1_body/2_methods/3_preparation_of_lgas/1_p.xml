<p id="Par18" class="p">CALB purchased from sigma was in liquid form and was dialyzed against PB buffer (10 mM, pH 7) for 72 h at 4 °C using dialysis tubing with MW cutoff ranging from 8000–14000, followed by 48 h freeze-drying yielding CALB powder. During each run, 10 mg CALB powder was dissolved in 0.7 mL deionized water and then injected into 6.3 mL of 4.25 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> GO suspension at pH 3.3. After shaking fiercely for 20 s, the mixture was subjected to a 50 h lyophilization to form the LGAs.
