<p id="Par8" class="p">SEM images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>) reveal that LGA has a porous structure with a continuous distribution of the pore diameter between 10 to 100 μm. However, the naked GO sheets fail to form a stable porous structure after freeze-drying treatment (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1a</xref>), probably due to the stacking of naked GO sheets after the removal of the entrapped water molecules. From the STEM and TEM images shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c, d</xref>, we find that 80% of CALB (3 nm × 4 nm × 5 nm) is deposited in the wrinkles of GO sheets, where the GO provides more available binding sites for CALB molecules. The confocal microscopy image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>) shows a molecular dispersion of CALB (labeled with Rhb) in the aerogel. According to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1b</xref>), the specific surface area of the LGA is 14 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with meso- and macro- pores spreading all over the porous network. The carbon, nitrogen and oxygen contents are 58, 7, and 35% w.t., respectively, as interpreted from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>). All nitrogen element in LGA should be from CALB, because GO is supposed to have no nitrogen atoms.
