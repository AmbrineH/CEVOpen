  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup> studied lipases from 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizopus oryzae</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida rugosa</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Penicillium camemberti</italic> and found that GO enhanced the thermal stability, solvent tolerance and activity of the enzyme in organic solvents. Husain and coworkers

 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> onto polyaniline-coated silver-functionalized GO nanocomposites and achieved an improved thermal stability and activity in aqueous solutions. Improved stability in organic solvents was also reported for lipases from

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>
 </sup>, because it enables enzymes to stay in a hydrophilic and structurally flexible network, where the enzymes can maintain their native conformation in an anhydrate condition. Here, we choose 
 <italic class="italic">Candida Antarctica</italic> lipase B (CALB) as a model enzyme to prepare lipase-GO aerogel (LGA). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, we first mix the solutions of CALB and GO at pH 3.3 and shake it to form lipase-GO hydrogel. Then the lipase-GO aerogel is prepared by freeze-drying the hydrogel at −40 °C for 50 h. The hydrogel is formed through electrostatic interactions under pH 5 when the CALB molecules and GO sheets carry opposite charges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). While a lower pH can facilitate hydrogel formation, it may also compromise the stability of CALB. To balance the opposite effects, we choose pH 3.3 for the preparation of LGA in the following experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>).
