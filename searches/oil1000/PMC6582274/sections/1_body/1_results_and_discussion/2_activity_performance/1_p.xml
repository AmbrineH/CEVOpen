 </sup>, from geraniol and vinyl acetate at 20 °C under different water activities in a continuous reactor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> (the turnover number was the average reaction rate within the first two hours of reaction), LGA and lipase powder have the same optimal water activity of 0.34, while the apparent activity of LGA is 5 to 10-fold higher than that of lyophilized lipase powder at all water activities except 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0 based on the same amount of lipase. It is noteworthy that LGA retains 67 % of its maximal activity under an absolutely anhydrous condition (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0). In contrast, the lyophilized lipase powder is completely inactive at the same condition. This may be attributed to the structural rigidity of enzymes in anhydrous conditions, which hindered the necessary conformational transition during catalysis, as detailed by Klibanov and his coworkers in their study of non-aqueous phase enzyme catalysis

 </sup>. The drastic difference in enzyme activity indicates that lipase immobilized in aerogel retains its activity without relying on the
