The hydrophobicity of GO can be conveniently tuned by its oxygen content, making GO-lipase aerogel available for various reactions. To further demonstrate the versatility of this method, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida rugosa</italic> lipase (CRL) and 
 <italic class="italic">Porcine pancreatic</italic> Lipase (PPL), two lipases with large lids, were tested for transesterification of geraniol and vinyl acetate. Supplementary Fig.
