<p id="Par11" class="p">To investigate whether the GO sheets stabilize the CALB structure by preserving water molecules or by directly interacting with the CALB, we applied the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine the water contents of the lyophilized LGA, CALB and GO, respectively. We determined the mass loss of the bounded water molecules by incubating these materials at 110 °C for 30 min

 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>, the initial drops at 80 °C refer to the loss of free water, and the subsequent drops at 110 °C are attributed to the loss of bounded water. The amount of bounded water in LGA3 is determined to be 0.04%, which is much less than that in the lyophilized CALB (~0.08%) and GO (~0.1%). It indicates that the formation of LGA3 excludes significant amount of the bounded water molecules, and the water exclusion may be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between CALB and GO. Therefore, we conclude that the hydroxyl-rich GO sheets direct interact with CALB by replacing a portion of bonded water molecules of lipase. In such a microenvironment, enzymes, like lipase, can maintain the native conformations and can undergo essential conformational changes for catalysis without relying on the presence of water molecules.
