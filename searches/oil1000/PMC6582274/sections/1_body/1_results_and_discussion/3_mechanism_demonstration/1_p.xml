 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0, we employed solid-state circular dichroism (ssCD) spectroscopy to examine the secondary structures of CALB in the aerogel. We prepared three types of LGAs using GO sheets with the same oxygen content (35% w.t.) but different hydroxyl content (interpreted from the infrared absorption of hydroxyl groups at wavenumbers from 3300 to 3600 cm

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>, the dry lipase powder has almost lost its native secondary structure, while the lipase in different forms of LGAs (designated as LGA1, LGA2, and LGA3) keeps a β-sheet content close to its native form in phosphate buffer and only undergoes some small changes in the content of α-helix. The increase in the hydroxyl content, i.e. from LGA1 to LGA3, helps maintain the secondary structures of the encapsulated lipase closer to its native form (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>), as a result, the transesterification activity of LGA increases accordingly, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>. These all suggest that the hydroxyl groups on the GO sheets play a vital role in the maintaining of the native conformations and activity of enzymes in an anhydrate gas phase.
