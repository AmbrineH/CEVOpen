<p id="Par13" class="p">We examined the effects of water content and temperature on the stability of the LGA3 by incubation at temperatures ranging from 20 to 80 °C. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref> shows that the LGA3 exhibits a maximum activity at 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0.34 at all temperatures, and it can retain about 60% of the maximum activity at 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0, while the lyophilized lipase powder is completely inactive. We carried out the reaction at 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0 and 0.34 under different temperatures for 10 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b–e</xref>). In all cases, the stability of the LGA3 is significantly improved compared with the lyophilized lipase powder, especially the LGA3 shows no apparent loss in activity over 10 h. The presence of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> in the gas flow (
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0.34) can lead to the deactivation of lipase, and the deactivation will be accelerated if increasing the reaction temperature. The reduced enzyme activity can be mainly attributed to the distortion of enzyme structures due to the unfavorable collision of free water molecules toward the enzymes and the thermal fluctuations of enzyme structures. We confirmed the denaturing of lipase in LGA3 from the structural changes after a 10-h operation at 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0.34 and 80 °C by ssCD spectra (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). In addition, the collapse and deformation of aerogel caused by the adsorption/desorption of moisture may bring additional mass transfer resistance (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). Finally, we examined the long-term performance of LGA3 at 20 °C and under anhydrous condition, i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> = 0, using an apparatus shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>. The high activity of lipase-GO hydrogel in an anhydrous gas flux enables implementation of enzymatic reaction at room temperature, making the reaction environmentally more friendly, industrially more economical, and operationally more convenient. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6f</xref>, the LGA3 retains 100% of activity over 500 h, which is, by far, the longest operating time ever reported. The extraordinary stability and activity of the enzyme confirm that the presence of GO resembles a natural microenvironment for enzymes.
