<p id="Par14" class="p">In conclusion, we have established a facile method to engineer a water-like microenvironment for gas-phase enzymatic reactions by embedding enzymes in a hydrophilic, hydroxyl-rich GO aerogel matrix. The lipase-GO aerogel is capable to catalyze gaseous transesterification under anhydrous conditions. Characterizations including STEM, ssCD, and TGA and activity assays reveal that the GO stabilizes lipase by forming a water-like microenvironment which preserves the native structure of enzyme and thus the high activity in anhydrous catalysis. The excellent stability enables a long-duration continuous operation for 500â€‰h. The ease of preparation and operation makes this robust enzyme-GO aerogel promising for industrial applications of gas-phase enzymatic catalysis.</p>
