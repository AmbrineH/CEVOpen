  <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Enteritidis and 
  <italic class="italic">S. enterica</italic> serotype Typhimurium are frequently present among poultry and are associated with outbreaks of human salmonellosis. The study investigated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) obtained from 
  <italic class="italic">Aloysia triphylla</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Litsea cubeba</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Syzygium aromaticum</italic> against 
  <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Enteritidis and 
  <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Thyphimurium strains previously isolated from poultry. A 1:1 mixture of 
  <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> was also tested. The activity of all compounds was evaluated against the yeast 
  <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, commonly used as probiotic. The highest antibacterial activity was observed for 
  <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> (minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 1.26 mg/mL to 0.63 mg/mL), 
  <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> (MICs from 2.637 mg/mL to 0.164 mg/mL) and the mixture (MICs from 1.289 mg/mL to 0.322 mg/mL). No activity was recorded against 
  <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae.</italic> The results suggest a possible use of 
  <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic>, alone or in combination, in the farm environment for disinfection and in poultry diet, combined with 
  <italic class="italic">S. cerevisiae</italic> administration, for an integrated approach to avoid 
  <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> intestinal colonization.
