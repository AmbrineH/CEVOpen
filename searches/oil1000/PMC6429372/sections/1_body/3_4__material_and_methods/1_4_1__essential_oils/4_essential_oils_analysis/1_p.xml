<p class="p">All the selected EOs and the mixture were analyzed by GC-MS according to the method previously described [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Briefly, the analysis was performed with a Varian CP-3800 apparatus (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion-trap mass detector (Varian Inc.). The oven temperature was programmed rising from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; injector temperature 220 °C; transfer-line temperature 240 °C; carrier gas He (1 mL/min).
