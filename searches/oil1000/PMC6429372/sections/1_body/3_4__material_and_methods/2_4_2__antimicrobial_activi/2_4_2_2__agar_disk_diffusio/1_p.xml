<p class="p">Antibacterial activity of the selected EOs and the mixture was tested by Kirby-Bauer agar disk diffusion method following the procedures reported by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Briefly, EOs and the mixture were diluted 1:10 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Oxoid Ltd.) and one absorbent paper disk was impregnated with 10 µl of each dilution, respectively, and tested against each isolate. In this way 10 µl for each disk had 171 µg for
