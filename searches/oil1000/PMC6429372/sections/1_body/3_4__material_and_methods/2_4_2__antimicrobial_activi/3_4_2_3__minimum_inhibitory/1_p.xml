 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The MIC value was determined as the lowest concentration, expressed in mg/mL, for each EO and the mixture at which bacteria and yeast showed no visible growth. The same assay was performed simultaneously for microorganisms growth control (tested agents and media) and sterility control (tested oil or mixture and media).
