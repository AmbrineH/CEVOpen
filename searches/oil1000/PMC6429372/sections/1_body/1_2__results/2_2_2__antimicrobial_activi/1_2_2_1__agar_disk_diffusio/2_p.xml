 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Enteritidis 232 was found to be the least sensitive isolate to 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> alone or in combination; 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Enteritidis 233 was found to be poorly sensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic>, but showed a large inhibition zone (15.0 mm) when tested with the mixture. The strains 234 and 236 appeared to be the most sensitive to these EOs.
