<p class="p">The tested 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Typhimurium isolates were less sensitive to the assayed EOs when compared with 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Enteritidis strains. In fact, inhibition zones ranged from 7.0 mm to 13.0 mm. The lowest antimicrobial activity was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> EOs, with an average inhibition zone of 7.0 mm. 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Typhimurium 261 and 176 were the most sensitive strains to 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> showing inhibition zones of 10.0 mm and 13.0 mm, respectively, whereas the remaining 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Typhimurium strains had zones of 7.0 mm. The inhibition zone ranged from 9.0 mm to 11.0 mm for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> and from 9.0 mm to 13.0 mm for the mixture.
