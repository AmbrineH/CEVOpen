 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Enteritidis and 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Thyphimurium strains, previously isolated from poultry. Moreover, their activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> was checked to evaluate the impact of these natural products (alone or in combination) on this probiotic yeast, to yield an integrated control of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> infections in poultry breeding. These EOs and mixture were selected on the basis of their biological activity on bacterial and fungal agents characterized by a huge impact on poultry breeding [
