<p class="p">Previous studies demonstrated the antibacterial effect of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> EOs due to the presence of several constituents. In particular, eugenol has been proven to be a component of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> EO, with a large spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal effects [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> EO employed in the present study had a relevant amount (77.9%) of this component, which could have determined the antibacterial effect.
