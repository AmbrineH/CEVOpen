<p class="p">All the EOs tested in this study had been previously assayed against an 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> strain: 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> had an MIC value of 2.52 mg/mL, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> of 1.318 mg/mL and their blend of 2.578 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The activity against the different 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> isolates resulted as being much higher, in fact MIC values decreased to 0.63 mg/mL, 0.164 mg/mL and 0.322 mg/mL, respectively.
