 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> activity has been attributed to cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, substances that react with lipid and hydroxyl radicals converting them into stable products through their hydrogen-donating ability [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Moreover, these components are able to inhibit the production of essential enzymes by the bacteria due to the presence of a carbonyl group that binds and inactivates them and/or causes damage to the cell wall of the bacteria [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. EO from 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> used in our investigation had 3% eugenol and 56.4% cinnamaldehyde (which represents its main compound) content. The presence of both constituents may have enhanced the antibacterial effect, as suggested by Burt et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00900" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], who described a higher antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> EO compared with cinnamaldehyde alone.
