 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> EOs in a 1:1 mixture seem to be promising natural products to be employed against field 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Enteritidis and 
 <italic class="italic">S.</italic> Typhimurium strains affecting poultry. Although they cannot be used for therapeutic scope, they could be applied in environmental disinfection considering their additional activity against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Moreover, these EOs could be added in feed to prevent intestinal colonization in chickens. Use of these EOs in poultry diets would not interfere with
