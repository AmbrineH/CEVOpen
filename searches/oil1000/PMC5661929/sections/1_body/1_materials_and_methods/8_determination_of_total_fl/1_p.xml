<p id="Par25" class="p">The total flavonoids content (TFC) was performed according to the colorimetric assay previously published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. One mL of the sample (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 0.75 mL of 5% sodium nitrite solution. After 5 min, 0.15 ml of 10% aluminium chloride solution (AlCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) was added and the mixture was left standing for 5 min, and then 0.5 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to the solution. The volume of the mixture was adjusted to 2.5 mL with distilled water and mixed well. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm. TFC was expressed as milligrams of catechin equivalent per gram dry weight basis (mg CAE/g DW).
