<p id="Par24" class="p">The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined using a modified colorimetric Folin-Ciocalteu method previously reported by Tlili et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Briefly, Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added to 1 mg of different sample and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Next, 7.5% of Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> was added to the mixture and re-incubate for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 760 nm in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, 1240 model, Tokyo, Japan). The analysis was performed in triplicate and TPC was expressed as gallic acid equivalents in milligrams per gram of dry weight basis (mg GAE/g DW).
