<p id="Par41" class="p">GC–MS analysis of the HS-SPME aroma compounds obtained from 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> seed led to the identification of 20 components corresponding to 95.5% of the total oil content (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). As already seen in HD, sesquiterpenes showed a similar pattern using SPME extraction: oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the major fraction of the essential oil (55.12%) followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (21.80%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (7.82%). However, some differences in the amounts of major components were detected according to the extraction methods. As appears from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, spathulenol (51.45%) was the main sesquiterpenes detectable by SPME. The mass spectrum of spathulenol and its compound structure is illustrated in Fig.
