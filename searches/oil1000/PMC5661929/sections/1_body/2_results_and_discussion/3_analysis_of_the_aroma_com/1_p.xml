<p id="Par40" class="p">To our knowledge this study is the first report on the extraction of aroma compounds from 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> using both HD and HS-SPME methods. The yield of essential oils obtained by HD was 0.84%. A total of 19 components representing 89.494% of the total essential oils were identified (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> seeds was characterized mainly by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (57.517%) followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (11.794%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (6.659%). The most representative components were spathulenol (47.989%), isospathulenol (5.798%), 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>-Elemene (4.195%), 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>-gurjunene (4.034%) and camphor (3.657%). The presence of sesquiterpenes as a major volatile component in the leave from other species such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. viridulum,</italic> have been already reported by John et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. According to [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] Myrcene and n-Nonane were the main components of the essential oil from the flowers and leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic>, respectively.
