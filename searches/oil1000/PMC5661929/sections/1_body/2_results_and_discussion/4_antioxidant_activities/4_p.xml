<p id="Par47" class="p">Overall, the results obtained from the three methods have shown that 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> exhibited an important antioxidant activity. The obtained results are in agreement with several reports. Notably, the recent study of Dong et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], demonstrated that essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">Chuanminshen violaceum</italic> had potent antioxidant activity in vitro when compared to other sub-fraction like ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol and chloroform fraction. However, findings of Mohamed et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] suggested that methanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Commiphora myrrha</italic> exhibited higher DPPH scavenging capacity than the essential oil. These results suggested that there is a relationship between the chemical composition of aromatic plants and their antioxidant activity. According to our results, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. tobira</italic> seed essential oil might be attributed to the presence of biologically active component such as spathulenol, Î»-gurjunene, camphor and isospathulenol. Spathulenol was found to be the important component in many medicinal plants such as 
 <italic class="italic">Stachys inflata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Kundmannia syriaca</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Additionally, previous studies showed the immunomodulatory effects of spathulenol identified from 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia spinosa</italic> essential oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Moreover, studies of Martins et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>], have demonstrated the anti-tumor potential of spathulenol.
