  <bold class="bold">Context:</bold>
  <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic> Dujardin 1845 (Anisakidae) nematodes can cause gastrointestinal and allergic diseases when humans eat raw or undercooked seafood containing larvae. There is currently no drug available in the market against this parasitic disease, and the study of plant-derived molecules could be useful in the discovery of effective compounds.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Objective:</bold> This research assesses the biocidal activity of a range of essential oils (EOs) from some Mediterranean plants against larvae found in the musculature of fresh fish.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Materials and methods:</bold> EOs composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. All the EOs were diluted at 5% v/v in olive oil to cover the fish with the solutions for 24â€‰h. The larvae that abandoned the muscle and the larvae obtained from the artificial digestion of the fish were collected. Controls were carried out in parallel. Furthermore, Wistar rats were infected with the live larvae collected from the 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> trials in order to find any larvae that may have penetrated the gastrointestinal wall.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Results:</bold> Between 60.8% and 87.6% of parasites treated with EOs abandoned the fish muscle, and the highest 
  <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> mortality rate was achieved with oregano EO (53.9%). Rats previously treated with oregano, cumin and Spanish lavender EOs showed no detectable lesions in the digestive tract due to the infection with larvae.
 </p>
 <p class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Conclusions:</bold> Oregano (
  <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic> L. Lamiaceae), cumin (
  <italic class="italic">Cuminum cyminum</italic> L. Apiaceae) and Spanish lavender (
  <italic class="italic">Lavender stoechas</italic> L. Lamiaceae) EOs could be used as promising ingredients in the development of products for the control of anisakiasis.
