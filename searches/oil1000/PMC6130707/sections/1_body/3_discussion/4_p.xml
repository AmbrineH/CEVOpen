<p class="p">With regard to the action of Spanish lavender EO, we should point out that although it did not show larvicidal action in the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies, in the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> trials no lesions were observed in the infected animals treated with this EO. The chemical composition identified in this oil was: fenchone (48.7%), camphor (40.0%) and 1,8-cineole (5.2%), so the EO analyzed could be considered a camphor-fenchone chemotype, according to Granger et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1973</xref>). Others authors detected these molecules in the Spanish lavender EO as its most representative components (Zrira &amp; Benjilal 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Dadalioglu &amp; Evrendilek 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), although differences in the percentages have been found: fenchone, 14.9–75.5%; camphor, 2.5–56.2%; and 1,8-cineole, 0.2–8% (Ristocelli et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>). Considering the high amount of fenchone detected in our oil, the difference in activity between the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> trials for this EO may be related to a possible conversion, facilitated by the gastric pH, of fenchone into its alcohol derivative, fenchol, a compound which has been shown to be effective against G + and G − bacteria, as well as against various fungi (Kotan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Guleria et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
