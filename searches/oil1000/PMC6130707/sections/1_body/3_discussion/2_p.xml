<p class="p">With regard to the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> trials, the action of oregano, cumin and Spanish lavender EOs on the L3s in the fish muscle resulted in the larvae not causing any lesions in the animals’ digestive tract. The antimicrobial activity of essential oils, which are markedly lipophilic compounds, is related to their chemical composition, in which there is a predominance of terpenic derivatives (mono- and sesquiterpenes). Although its mechanism of action has not yet been fully explained, it is likely that in most cases it involves disruptions of the membrane, increasing the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, and of the mitochondrial membranes in eukaryotic organisms (Cowan 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>; Burt 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). A decrease in the hydrophobicity of certain terpenes by the addition of methyl groups reduces their antimicrobial activity (Mendoza et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>; Usano 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Furthermore, the main component of oregano EO, carvacrol, is known to interact with the cell membrane of some organisms, where it dissolves in the phospholipid bilayer and aligns between the fatty acid chains. The distortion of the physical structure causes expansion of the membrane, thus bringing about an increase in its permeability (García-García &amp; Palou-García 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Moreover, carvacrol and 1,8-cineole, alone or in combination, severely affected the viability of the bacteria and caused dramatic changes in the cell membrane permeability, leading to cell death, as observed by confocal laser microscopy (de Sousa et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
