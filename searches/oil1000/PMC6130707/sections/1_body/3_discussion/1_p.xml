<p class="p">Human anisakidosis presents a risk to public health that must be reduced through basic prevention. Steps to control the disease include various measures and checks to detect and kill the larvae in fish, thus preventing infection of the consumer. The main recommendations are freezing the fish or exposing it to temperatures over 60 °C. However, essential oils have long been recognized as effective plant-based antimicrobials and have been used to preserve foods for centuries, thus they could be good alternatives to the abovementioned methods to protect against anisakidosis. Indeed, all seven essential oils tested in this study did somehow appear to stimulate a high percentage of the 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic> L3 in the fish musculature to abandon it and migrate into the container (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>): the values were ≥70% for the lavender, Spanish lavender, marjoram, cumin, thyme and rosemary EOs, and slightly lower for the oregano one (60.8%). These data are of particular interest given that the muscle is the part of the fish that humans consume, and thus the reduced presence of parasites in this part would reduce the risk of contracting this disease. Furthermore, during this process a certain number of larvae in the fish died or lost spontaneous mobility on coming into contact with the essential oils (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>): the two most effective EOs in this sense were cumin and oregano, for which only 13.9% and 14.7% of the larvae, respectively, exhibited spontaneous movement. The favourable results obtained for these two EOs against 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic> larvae are in keeping with those described by Valero et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), although this study was conducted under different conditions. The GC–MS analysis of cumin EO revealed the presence of its major components: cuminaldehyde (34.1%), 2-caren-10-al (20.8%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (12.3%) and 3-caren-10-al (11.8%); carvacrol was detected in a high proportion (88.4%) in the oregano oil, while a low proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (3.3%) and aromadendrene (2.4%) was found (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These compounds have been identified in both EOs, displaying inhibitory activity against certain pathogenic agents (Martinez-Velazquez et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Dussault et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Kedia et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Fournomiti et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The chemical profile of essential oil of a particular plant species shows different chemotypic variations because of ecological and geographical conditions, age of plant and time of harvesting (Prakash et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Such chemotypic variations would definitely affect the biological activity of the essential oil (Kedia et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thyme EO exhibited less anti-anisakis activity: it only achieved the death of 11.4% of larvae but a high percentage of larvae (53.4%) needed stimulus to move. For thyme EO at the same concentration (5%), Giarratana et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) indicated 100% mortality after 14 h of treatment; this difference in larvicidal activity could be due to the test conditions and the chemical composition of the essential oil used by these authors [thymol (50%), linalool (7%), carvacrol (3%), α-pinene and β-pinene (6%)] in comparison with the thyme EO employed by us [thymol (76.3%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (17.7%), carvacrol (2.4%) and linalool (1.4%)] (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The phenolic molecules thymol and carvacrol have been observed as the more active constituents (di Pasqua et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), being principally responsible for the antimicrobial activity, for example, against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">K. oxytoca</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> (Fournomiti et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The rest of the EOs did not display biocidal activity against the L3s.
