<p class="p">It should also be highlighted that in the case of the larvae treated with marjoram EO, although one larva was found in the body cavity of the animal, there were no visible signs of lesions in the digestive tract. This leads us to speculate that this EO, whose main component is 1,8-cineole (68.1%), may have favoured the reabsorption of the haemorrhage. This could be due to the anti-inflammatory activity of 1,8-cineole which, in agreement with the results obtained by Abu-Darwish et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) would exert an anti-inflammatory effect through a mechanism involving the inhibition of LPS-induced NO production. This molecule has also been shown to be the majority constituent in the chromatogram of this EO, followed by terpenoids (Waller et al.
