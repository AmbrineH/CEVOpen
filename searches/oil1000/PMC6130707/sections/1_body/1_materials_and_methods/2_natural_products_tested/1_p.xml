 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. Lamiaceae) and thyme (
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. Lamiaceae). These products were provided by Sensient Fragrances (Granada, Spain). The composition of the EOs was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) on an Agilent 7890A System (Santa Clara, CA) coupled with a Waters Quattro Micro GC mass spectrometer (Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain). The column used was a phenyl dimethylpolysiloxane capillary column ZB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 μm thickness), supplied by Phenomenex (Torrance, CA), with helium as the carrier gas (flow rate = 1 mL/min). The samples were injected using the split mode (split ratio 1:1000), with injector temperature at 200 °C. Oven temperature was programed from 50 °C (2.5 min) to 200 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, then kept at 200 °C for 8 min. Mass spectra were acquired in electron impact mode (70 eV). Components were identified by mass spectral fragmentation, by comparing Kovats-calculated (Dabrio
