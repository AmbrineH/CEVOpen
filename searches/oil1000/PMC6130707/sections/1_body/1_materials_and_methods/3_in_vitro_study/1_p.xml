<p class="p">All the EOs were diluted at 5% v/v in olive oil. The presence of parasitic larvae in the muscle of the hosts was confirmed by direct observation. About 7–9 fish were used for each EO, which were gutted, washed and placed in glass containers covered with each essential oil solution. The containers were closed and kept for 24 h at 4 °C. The larvae that had abandoned the muscle were then collected, and the fish was then washed and immediately submitted to artificial digestion in a pepsin-HCl solution (pH 2–2.4) for 45 min at 36 °C. Following this, the larvae were counted, both those found loose in the container and those obtained from the digestion of the muscle. Controls were carried out in parallel, submerging the fish in olive oil (carrier), in order to verify that it has no effect on the larvae. The viability of the parasites was determined in saline solution 0.9% at 24 h under a stereoscopic microscope, applying the following criteria of mobility: dead if no movement or response to stimulus were observed, apparently alive if there was movement when stimulated with a brush and alive if there was spontaneous movement.</p>
