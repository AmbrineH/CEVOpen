<p class="p">Forty-four female Wistar rats (weighing 140–150 g) were infected via a gastric probe with 4–8 active larvae mixed with 0.5 mL of water. The trials were conducted according to the following protocol: (a) many animals were infected with the live larvae that had abandoned the muscle during the immersion period in each of the EOs, (b) another lot consisted of animals infected with the larvae recovered from the fish after treatment and subsequent digestion. In order to establish the potential influence of the carrier oil on the viability of the larvae, a control lot was designed consisting of rats infected with the larvae obtained following the digestion of the fish submerged only in olive oil. Four hours later, the animals were sacrificed and immediately their organs were examined in detail to find any larvae that may have penetrated the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Lastly, the digestive system was removed and opened under a stereoscopic microscope, recording the location of the larvae and the number of parasites and lesions found.</p>
