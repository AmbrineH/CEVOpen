<p class="p">All the parasites recovered from the rats that had been taken from the fish muscle treated with EOs were found alive, except for the 22.9%, which had been in contact with cumin EO. The greatest number of larvae were recovered from the small intestine (49.1%), followed by the stomach (41.3%) and only 6.0% from the cecum. 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the number of rodents infected and larvae inoculated, the lesions produced and their locations. With regard to the control lot, made up of animals that were infected with larvae from untreated fish muscle subjected to digestion, lesions were observed in all cases.
