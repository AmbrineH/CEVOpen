<p class="p">This study was influenced by the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> results in terms of the number of larvae found alive and active following exposure of the fish to the different EOs. A total of 44 animals were infected with 218 larvae obtained in the 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> trials, but the parasites only penetrated the digestive tract wall in five cases (11.4%). One rat had a lesion consisting of a tunnel measuring 2 × 1.5 mm with slight bleeding, located in the greater curvature of the stomach, and the larva was found partially embedded at the end of the tunnel. This lesion was caused by one of the L3 exposed to lavender EO that was collected from the container after abandoning the muscle.
