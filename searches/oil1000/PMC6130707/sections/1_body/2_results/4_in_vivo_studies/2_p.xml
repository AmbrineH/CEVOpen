<p class="p">The larvae treated with rosemary EO caused a similar tunnel-shaped lesion, although of greater length (4 × 1 mm), and a small ulcer (1.5 × 1 mm) surrounded by a bleeding halo; the larvae, as in the previous case, were found embedded in the greater curvature of the stomach. A third ulcer was also observed in the small intestine accompanied by signs of bleeding. The first lesion was caused by one of the L3 that had abandoned the fish muscle; the other two were caused by L3 that had remained in the muscle. Furthermore, L3s treated with rosemary EO and taken from the muscle produced two small ulcers (1 × 1 mm) in another infected rat; in one of these ulcers the parasite was found stuck in the gastric wall of the greater curvature, showing no visible signs of bleeding, and in the other it was located in a reddish area of the small intestine.</p>
