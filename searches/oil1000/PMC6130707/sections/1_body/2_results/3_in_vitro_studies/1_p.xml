<p class="p">In the trials conducted with the parasitized fish treated with the Eos, a displacement of the larvae was generally observed from the parasitized tissues to the container in which the test was conducted. This migration was above 60% in all cases. Moreover, all the EOs tested produced a drop in the survival rate of the larvae. The highest total mortality rate was detected for oregano EO (53.9%), with the larvae showing severe oesophageal and intestinal deterioration (

For the lavender, marjoram and rosemary EOs the survival rate was 100%. For the larvae that remained alive, a reduction in spontaneous movement was detected, with the maximum reduction (65.8%) corresponding to larvae treated with cumin EO and the minimum (12.3%) to Spanish lavender EO; results in between these values were obtained for thyme (53.4%), lavender (31.7%) and oregano (31.4%) EOs. None of the larvae treated with marjoram and rosemary EOs required stimulation to be actively mobile. In the controls, all the larvae displayed great mobility.
