<p class="p">The essential oils tested in this work provoked the migration of the 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic> larvae out of the fish, therefore they might well be added to the marinated fish plates. This fact, together with the biocidal action of some of them, particularly Spanish lavender, cumin and oregano EOs, are promising active ingredients that could be used in the development of effective products for the control of anisakidosis. Further studies on safety and palatability of the marinating with essential oils should be carried out.
