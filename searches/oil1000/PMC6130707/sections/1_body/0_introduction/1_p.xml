<p class="p">The consumption of marine fish has increased over recent decades, raising the number of cases of human anisakidosis. The main agent responsible for this parasitosis is the third larval stage (L3) of 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic> Dujardin, 1845 (Anisakidae), nematodes which are widely found in fish and cephalopods, with high mean prevalence and intensity rates in many species of commercial interest (Chía et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Human beings get infected when they consume raw or undercooked fish or cephalopods. According to various authors, these nematodes are highly resistant to the conditions created by traditional marinating methods; they are able to survive for periods of a few days up to several weeks, depending on the concentration of salt, acetic acid and marinating times (Karl et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). All these circumstances lead to frequent reports of anisakidosis all over the world, with Japan at the top of the list with more than 2000 cases a year, due to high raw fish consumption in this country. When larvae invade the human gastrointestinal tract, they are usually found in the gastric cavity, they can also be located in various different areas of the intestine. Clinical symptoms range from digestive problems, which vary depending on the location of the larvae, to allergic reactions of varying severity, and sometimes both at the same time. In terms of prevention, various different prophylactic measures were proposed shortly after the first cases were diagnosed in humans. The European Union and WHO, now aware of the problem, stress the importance of freezing fish and seafood products destined for salting, marinating and cold smoking, at a temperature of −20 °C or lower for at least 24 h, or heating the fish to over 60 °C. For its part, the FDA advises freezing the fish at −20 °C for seven days or at −35 °C for 15 h in order to kill any larvae. Nevertheless, it would be of interest to have other alternative measures at our disposal in daily practices that guarantee the destruction of the larvae. To fulfil this aim, various studies reporting on the larvicidal effect of different natural products have been published, especially the essential oils and/or their components (Hierro et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this study, various essential oils (EOs) extracted from plant species present in the Mediterranean region have been evaluated. The specific purpose of this research was to study the potential action of these EOs on 
 <italic class="italic">Anisakis</italic> larvae in the musculature of fish and later on to assess their infectivity on laboratory animals.
