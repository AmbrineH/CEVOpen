<p class="p"> The results of our study demonstrated that SNP and ZEO have synergistic antibacterial activities against 
 <italic class="italic">Staph</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salm</italic>. Typhimurium. It was also shown that the antimicrobial and biofilm removal properties of SNP and ZEO were affected by the type of microorganisms and concentrations of both compounds. ZEO displayed a fast antimicrobial activity. Both antimicrobials represented considerable biofilm removal activity on both bacteria. The combination of SNP and ZEO was additive, which means significant antibacterial and antibiofilm activity could achieve by use of agents at concentrations without compromising their antibacterial effects. The best concentrations for SNP- ZEO sanitizing solution were 12.5 μg/ mL for SNP and 625 μg/ mL for ZEO. Our results highlighted the powerful combination activity of SNP and ZEO which accelerated antibacterial activity, alleviated undesirable sensorial property of ZEO and reduced the concentration of both compounds.
