<p class="p"> Silver ions and silver-based compounds are widely known as highly toxic to 16 major species of bacteria due to their multiple mechanisms of action. Zarei et al. (2014) reported the MIC values of SNP against

 </sup> The small size and high ratio of surface to volume in SNPs, allow them to more effectively contact with microorganisms and induce their antimicrobial activities.

 </sup> It has been shown that antibacterial efficacy of SNP varies between different prepared SNPs. Given the fact that factors such as the type of bacteria, the media of inoculation, type and the size of nanoparticle and the method of preparation must be considered when comparing the antibacterial activity of different nanoparticles.
