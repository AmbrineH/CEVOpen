 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Results also showed that the loss began before 15 min and continued up to 60 min. In general, loss of cytoplasmic materials by ZEO from both bacteria was faster than SNP. The leakage pattern of 260-nm absorbing material was directly linked to the sanitizing activity of both antimicrobial compounds. As shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, no significant release of 260 nm absorbing material with SNP- treated at MIC concentration over 15 min for both bacteria was found. Higher exposure time (60 min) significantly increased the cell leakage of

 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), caused 3 and 4-fold more gross membrane damage, in
