<p class="p">Kremer et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] conducted a study on related species 
 <italic class="italic">M. kerneri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> in several locations in the Balkans, including Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, and Northern Greece, locations that are geographically similar and relatively close to the collection sites of 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> in this study. The two 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria</italic> species from the above locations did not contain pulegone, menthone, or neomenthol, the major EO constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> in this study. The limonene concentration in 
 <italic class="italic">M. kerneri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> varied from 0% to 5.4%, while germacrene varied from 1.5% to 4.9% in the EO of the two species.
