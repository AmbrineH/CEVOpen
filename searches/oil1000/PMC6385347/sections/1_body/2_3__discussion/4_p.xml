<p class="p">Menthone is a major EO constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha piperita</italic> and other mints and geraniums and is utilized widely in perfumery and cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, e-cigarettes, and other products due to its easily identifiable soothing minty scent. Menthone is a predominant EO constituent in peppermint young growing leaves [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. At maturation, and at senescence, however, menthone is reduced to menthol and isomenthol [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. On the other hand, pulegone is reduced by pulegone reductase to produce menthone and isomenthone in peppermint [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], demonstrating the close biochemical and physiological relationships between these compounds in peppermint oil glands as a function of environmental conditions, phenological phase, or the age of the individual plant leaves, and day length [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Further research is needed to reveal the biosynthetic processes in

One may speculate that the identified chemotypes in Micromeria are mostly a function of growth stage, plant part, and the environment, unless there is a side-by-side comparison of these chemotypes. Limonene, the most common terpene in nature, is constituent of citrus peel EO, and it is used extensively as a flavoring agent in the food industry and various cleaning products due to its fresh citrus aroma [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In addition, limonene is used as a precursor for the commercial production of carvone.
