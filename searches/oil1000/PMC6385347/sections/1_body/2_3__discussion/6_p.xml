<p class="p">A study on 
 <italic class="italic">M. persica</italic> from three locations in Iran [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] reported spathulenol (30.3%, 6.5%, and 10.8%), germacrene D (19.4%, 35.6%, and 22%), and bicyclogermacrene (18.9%, 15.7%, and 17.3%) as the major EO constituents. Pulegone and menthone (the major EO constituents in 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> in this study) were not found in 
 <italic class="italic">M. persica</italic> from Iran [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Gulluce et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] reported piperitenone (50.6%), pulegone (29.2%), and isomenthone (3.92%) as the major EO constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fruticosa</italic> (L.) Druce ssp 
 <italic class="italic">serpyllifolia</italic> (Bieb.) collected from Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. However, the 
 <italic class="italic">M. fruticosa</italic> ssp. 
 <italic class="italic">serpyllifolia</italic> did not have menthone (as is in this study).
