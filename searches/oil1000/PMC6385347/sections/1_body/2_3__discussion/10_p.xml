<p class="p">This literature overview of the EO composition of related species, some of which were collected in the same region, confirmed our hypothesis that the EO composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> is unique and different from the EO profile of other Micromeria species in the region. Therefore, the unique EO may have novel applications. 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic>, an endemic plant, is found only on dry rocky outcrops in the Balkan Mountains of Bulgaria; it grows on a limited amount of poor soil onto the rocks and apparently has a great ecological adaptability to environments with limited nutrients and water supply. In view of its unique chemical composition, EO yield, and ecological plasticity, the plant may have a potential as a new crop and as a commercial source for high-menthone and high-pulegone EO for the flavor and fragrance industries and possibly for the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries. Further research is needed to evaluate the bioactivity of the plant biomass and its EO.
