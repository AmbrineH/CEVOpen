<p class="p">Pulegone, menthone, and limonene are monterpenes, found as constituents in the EO of a wide range of plant species [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] reconsidered the safety and toxicity of substances and withdrew six flavoring substances (including synthetic pulegone) from the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) list [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. However, this recent ruling of 2018 did not affect natural (derived from plants) pulegone. Therefore, we anticipate greater commercial demand for the sourcing of natural pulegone. The endemic plant 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic>, a subject of this study, would have a potential as a new source for natural pulegone, if introduced into culture.
