<p class="p">In a study on 
 <italic class="italic">M. fruticosa</italic> in Israel, Dudai et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] reported EO content (yield) variations from 0.5 to 0.72% and (+)-pulegone from 65 to 78% of the total oil as a function of day/night temperature regime and day length. Interestingly, the pulegone concentration in the leaves varied from 0% in the low base leaf pair to 71% in the tip leaf pairs, demonstrating dramatic changes within a plant and individual branch as a function of leaf age, development stage, and location. Also, the concentration of isomenthol varied from 0% in young leaves to more than 60% in older leaves, suggesting significant changes in monoterpene synthesis and accumulation during the development stages [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The EO content of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fruticosa</italic> reported from Israel [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] was a bit higher than the one of 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> in this study.
