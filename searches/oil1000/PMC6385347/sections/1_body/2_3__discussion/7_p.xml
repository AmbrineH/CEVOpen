<p class="p">In a study of 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria</italic> species from Bulgaria and Macedonia, the authors reported pulegone (35.8%), piperitenone (18.6), and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-methane-3-one (15.8) as the main EO constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. dalmatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Furthermore, caryophyllene oxide (0–14.3%), α-bisabolol (0–38.5%), geracrone (0–18.5%), and β-atlantol (0–9.9%) were the main constituents of the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">M. cristata</italic> collected from three locations in Bulgaria and Macedonia. In addition, caryophyllene oxide (11.2%), spatulenol (5.6%), and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-2-cren-4-ol (3.8%) were the main EO constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> from Macedonia [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In the same study, monoterpenes were the major group of EO constituents in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. dalmatica</italic> from Bulgaria and 
 <italic class="italic">M. cristata</italic> from one of the locations in Bulgaria, while sesquitepenes were the major group in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. cristata</italic> from the other two locations in Bulgaria and Macedonia and in 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> from Macedonia. In a study with 
 <italic class="italic">M. graeca</italic> (L.) from two locations in Greece, the authors [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] reported caryophyllene oxide (17.0%) and 
 <italic class="italic">epi</italic>-α-bisabolol (12.8%) as major constituents from one of the locations and linalool (18.1%) and β-chamigrene (12.5%) as the main EO constituents from the other location. 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-Verbenol was also relatively high in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. graeca</italic> from both locations. However, pulegone and menthone were not identified in the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. graeca</italic>, whereas germacrene D constituted 0.7% and 7.5% in the EO from location 1 and 2, respectively, and limonene was 1% of the EO from one of the locations [
