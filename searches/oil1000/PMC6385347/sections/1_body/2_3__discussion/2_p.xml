<p class="p">In this study, the main EO constituents of the endemic species 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> collected at two locations were pulegone (20.48–61.17%), menthone (16.62–56.28%), limonene (2.55–10.10%), neomenthol (0.93–7.75%), and germacrene D (1.05–3.48%). Previous research identified three chemotypes in Micromeria species: pulegone, piperitone oxide, and carvone [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> plants from Shipka may belong to the pulegone chemotype based on the results from this study. However, 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> from Uzana had menthone as the main EO constituent. Overall, 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> from both locations had a high concentration of menthone. Therefore, we may assume the presence of a menthone chemotype (Uzana plants) and pulegone-menthone chemotype (Shipka plants). Menthone chemotype was mentioned in a recent review on other 
 <italic class="italic">Micromeria</italic> species [
