<p class="p">Studies on this Bulgarian endemic plant are very few, and there are no refereed journal publications on the 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> EO composition. However, there are reports on related species from the same family [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. A study on the chemical composition of the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. kerneri</italic> Murb. and 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> (L.) Benth. from Southeast Europe found that the EO of 
 <italic class="italic">M. kerneri</italic> had a high concentration of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, with caryophyllene oxide as the major compound [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Caryophyllene oxide was also the major EO constituent of 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> from several collection sites in Montenegro except Mt. Krivo≈°ije, where piperitone oxide was the major EO constituent [

 <italic class="italic">M. dalmatica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">M. cristata</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> in Bulgaria and Macedonia reported the essential oil profiles of the three species [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] reported the EO composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. cristata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> collected in Serbia and Montenegro. The major EO constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">M. cristata</italic> were isoborneol (11.3%), borneol (8.5%), and verbenone (8.2%), whereas the ones in the 
 <italic class="italic">M. juliana</italic> EO were verbenol (11.8%), thymol (10.8%), caryophyllene oxide (10.5%), borneol (9.3%), and myrtenal (7.1%).
