<p class="p">In a phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fruticosa</italic>, a total of 215 phenolics and other compounds were tentatively identified, including some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. A study conducted on the EO composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. persica</italic> populations in the Fars region of Iran found that the main EO constituents of the four examined populations were germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, spathulenol, and δ-cadinene [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Another study [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] reported 
 <italic class="italic">M. fruticosa</italic> monoterpene content and composition as a function of the development stage, day length, and day/night temperature. The main EO constituents were (+)-pulegone from very low to 80% of the oil and isomenthol from 0 to 60% depending on the leaf age, location, development stage, and temperature. 
 <italic class="italic">M. graeca</italic> (L.) Bentham ex Reichenb. collected at two different locations in Attiki, Greece showed caryophyllene oxide (17.0%) and epi-α-bisabolol (12.8%) as the major constituents in the EO from one of the locations, whereas linalool (18.1%) and β-chamigrene (12.5%) were the main EO constituents from the second location [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-00440" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The hypothesis of this study was that the EO composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. frivaldszkyana</italic> will have a unique and different profile from the EO profile of related species in the same family. Furthermore, we expected to see minor differences in EO yield and profile between the two locations although the collection sites are in the same region. In addition, we expected minor alterations in the EO composition due to drying prior to oil extraction. Since this is endemic, protected, and rare plant, we had sufficient sample only from one of the locations to test the last assumption.
