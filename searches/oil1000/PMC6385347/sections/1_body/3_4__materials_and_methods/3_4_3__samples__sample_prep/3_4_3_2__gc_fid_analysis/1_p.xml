<p class="p">Quantitative analyses were carried out on a GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with a split–splitless injector (280 °C), an AOC-20i autosampler, and a flame ionization detector (FID). A SLB-5 ms 30 m × 0.25 mm id × 0.25 μm film thickness column (Merck Life Science) operated under the programmed temperature of 50 °C to 280 °C (5 min) at 3.0 °C/min. Injection volume and mode were 1.0 μL; the split ratio was 10:1. Helium was used as the carrier at a constant linear velocity of 30 cm/s and a pressure of 99.5 KPa. The FID temperature was set at 280 °C (sampling rate 60 ms), and gas flows were 40 mL/min for hydrogen, 30 mL/min for make up (nitrogen), and 400 mL/min for air. Data were processed through the 
 <italic class="italic">LabSolution</italic> software (version 5.92 Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). Quantification was performed using the GC-FID data. Each sample was analyzed for three consecutive runs for a major precision of data.
