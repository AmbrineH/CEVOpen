<p class="p">The essential oil (EO) analyses were carried out on a GCMS-QP2020 (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with a split–splitless injector, an AOC-20i autosampler, and a quadrupole MS detector. MS parameters were as follows: mass range 40–550 amu, scan speed 3333 amu/s, ion source temperature 220 °C, and interface temperature 250 °C. A SLB-5ms 30 m × 0.25 mm id × 0.25 μm film thickness column (Merck Life Science (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany)) (silphenylene polymer virtually equivalent in polarity to poly (5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl siloxane phase)) was used for the characterization of the volatile fraction. The column operated under a programmed temperature of 50 °C to 280 °C (5 min) at 3.0 °C/min. Injection volumes and mode were 1.0 μL; the split ratio was 10:1. Helium was used as a gas carrier at a constant linear velocity of 30 cm/s. The

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanes (C7-C30 Saturated Alkanes, Merck Life Science, Darmstadt, Germany) standard solution has been used for Linear Retention Indices (LRIs) calculation that supported the identification of analytes on the SLB-5ms column. The peaks assignment was carried out based on a double filter, namely the MS similarity spectra (over 85%) and a LRIs ± 5 compared to the values reported in the spectral library. For mass spectral identification, Shimadzu
