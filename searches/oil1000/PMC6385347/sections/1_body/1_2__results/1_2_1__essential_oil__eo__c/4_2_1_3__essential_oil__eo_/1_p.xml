<p class="p">Drying had a significant effect on the EO composition of plant material collected at Mount Shipka. Drying of the plant material prior to oil extraction significantly affected the concentration of two major EO constituents; drying increased the concentration of limonene (10.1% vs. 6.9%) in the EO from the fresh material and the concentration of neomenthol (2.43% vs. 0.93%) but decreased the concentration of pulegone (50.5% vs. 61.2%) in the EO from the fresh material. In addition, the concentrations of Hex-(2
