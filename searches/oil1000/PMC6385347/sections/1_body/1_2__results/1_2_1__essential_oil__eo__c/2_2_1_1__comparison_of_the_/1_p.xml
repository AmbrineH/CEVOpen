<p class="p">Overall, ketones were the major group of the EO chemical constituents, and there were no differences in their concentrations due to the location or drying of the material prior to oil extraction (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00440-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Monoterpene ketones were by far the largest subgroup, with cyclic and sesquiterpene ketones being negligible. While hydrocarbons constituted the second major EO chemical group in plants from Shipka, alcohols were the second major EO chemical group in plants from Uzana. There were significant differences between the plants from Uzana and Shipka with respect to the overall content of monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Drying of the plant material prior to EO extraction also resulted in a significant shift in the chemical groups of the EO constituents; hydrocarbons and alcohols were greater in the EO from the dried material than in the EO from the fresh material (
