<p class="p">This is the first study confirming the presence of osmophores in members of Anacardiaceae and providing details on their structure and function. It also reveals that while in both species the presence of a reward is advertised with a strong fragrance, still little is known on the evolution of scent and other cues signalling the presence of a reward present in most other members of Anacardiaceae and Sapindales. The results encourage further investigations on the possible presence of fragrances in other genera of the family and order, into the origin and composition of such fragrances and the relationship between their diversity and their pollination mechanisms.</p>
