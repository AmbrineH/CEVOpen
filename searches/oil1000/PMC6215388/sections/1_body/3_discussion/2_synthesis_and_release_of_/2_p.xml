<p class="p">There are some slight variations in the subcellular apparatus of each species studied here, which seem to be consistent with the variation of the composition of the floral fragrance. Sesquiterpenes, such as those dominant in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic>, are produced in the cytosol, whereas monoterpenes and diterpenes, such as those found more often in 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic>, are mainly produced by the plastids which are more numerous in this species (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2006
 </xref>). However, the isoprenoid precursors found in both genera may be available in different cell compartments and may be used to generate terpenoids in more than one cell compartment (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2006
 </xref>). In addition, benzyl esters are primarily synthesized in the plastids through the arogenate pathway and modified by the enzymes present in the cytosol (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maeda and Dudareva 2012</xref>), and the fatty acid derivatives, such as aldehydes, alcohols and their esters are produced by both plastids and peroxisomes (
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Borghi 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2017
 </xref>). Only plastoglobules were found exclusively in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> and may thus play a role in the dominant production of the sesquiterpenes (
