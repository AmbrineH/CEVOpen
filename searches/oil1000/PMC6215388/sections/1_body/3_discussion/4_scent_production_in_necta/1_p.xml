<p class="p">The floral scents are an important way of communication between the flowers and their pollinators. They indicate the presence of a reward offered by the flowers, most of the time nectar (

 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kubitzki 2011</xref>). In all families of the Sapindales for which the presence of osmophores has been reported, nectaries are also present as in the two species studied here (

 </xref>). Since most other members of the order produce nectar, it is surprising that there are to date only a few reports of scented flowers mainly in Meliaceae, Rutaceae and Sapindaceae (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kubitzki 2011</xref>). In addition, most members of Sapindales produced (terminal or distal) inflorescences with numerous flowers which sometimes have a conspicuous fleshy nectary disc, but individual flowers are often small and their perianth inconspicuous, and appear, at least to the human eye, to not present any other obvious visual cues that indicate a reward (

 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kubitzki 2011</xref>). Therefore, scented flowers and osmophores in flowers of Anacardiaceae and other sapindalean families have either been overlooked until now, or rely on other strategies to attract pollinators, which can only become evident with further studies.
