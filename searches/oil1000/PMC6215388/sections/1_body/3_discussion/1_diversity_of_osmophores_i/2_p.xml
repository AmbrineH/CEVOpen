<p class="p">In other families of the Sapindales, the presence of osmophores was reported only in a few other species. In Rutaceae, osmophores have been described in a few species of 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> on the tips of the petals and consist of a distinctly papillose epidermis with glandular trichomes (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2015
 </xref>). Scents have also been identified in flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">Boronia</italic>; however, the authors could not confirm whether osmophores were responsible for its production (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 1995

 <italic class="italic">Paullinia weinmanniifolia</italic> on the stamens and sepals (
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lima 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>), but neither with information on their structure, nor, like in 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic>, with details on their ultrastructure. Therefore, comparisons of osmophore diversity and evolution in Sapindales are still hampered by the lack of detailed studies.
