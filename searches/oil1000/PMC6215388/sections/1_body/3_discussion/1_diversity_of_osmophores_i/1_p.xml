<p class="p">In the present study, we describe the presence of specialized secretory epidermal cells concentrated at the base of the petals of 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic>—interpreted here as osmophores (see below subcellular apparatus). Coincidentally, both species were previously placed in Mangiferae (
 <italic class="italic">sensu</italic>
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Engler 1892</xref>) and now, together with most other former members of this tribe, form a well-supported monophyletic clade nested in Anacardioideae, the largest of the two subfamilies of Anacardiaceae (
 <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weeks 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>). In both species, the osmophores are conspicuously situated along ridges of the adaxial (ventral) side of petals; a similar structure is also sometimes visible in pictures and sections of other members of the family, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Pleiogynium solandri</italic> in Spondioideae, and 
 <italic class="italic">Semecarpus riparius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. australiensis</italic> in Anacardioideae (

 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bachelier and Endress 2009</xref>). However, a careful re-examination of the sections of these genera and those studied by 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bachelier and Endress (2009</xref>; see list of material therein) confirmed the secretory activity of the epidermal cells on these ridges only in 
 <italic class="italic">Anacardium occidentale</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic>, and its absence in all other taxa. Only one previous study using neutral red suggested that osmophores may also be present on the adaxial side and tips of the petals of 
 <italic class="italic">Tapirira guianensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fernandes 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2012
 </xref>), which belong to the subfamily Spondioideae. However, they did not report any scent, and staining with neutral red is not always conclusive (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gonçalves-Souza 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> 2017
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Demarco 2017b</xref>). Our study is thus the first to provide anatomical evidence of the production of volatiles in Anacardiaceae, and more studies are necessary to confirm the presence of scented flowers and potential osmophores in more members of the family.
