<p class="p">In this study, we localized and characterized previously unrecognized specialized epidermal cells located at the base of the adaxial side of each petal of 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic> and based on their secretory function, interpret them here as osmophores. Their ultrastructural features were studied before and during anthesis in order to understand their mechanism of secretion and whether there is a link between their subcellular apparatus and the composition of the floral fragrance by examining flowers of each species by gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Based on our results, we also discuss the importance of diversified strategies on the attraction of pollinators in Anacardiaceae and the entire Sapindales, despite the scarcity of reports of osmophores in the order.
