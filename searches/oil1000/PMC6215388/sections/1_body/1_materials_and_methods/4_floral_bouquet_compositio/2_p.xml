<p class="p">Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of the volatile oils was performed with an Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm) and connected to an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer operating in the positive ion electron impact ionization (70 eV; m/z 50–800; source temperature 280 °C; quadruple temperature 180 °C). The column temperature was initially maintained at 50 °C for 5 min, increased to 100 °C at 3 °C min
