<p class="p">Our GC-MS analyses revealed that out of the 39 volatile compounds produced by the flowers in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> and 21 in 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic>, 14 are identical (10 sesquiterpenes and 4 monoterpenes). Diverse sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes occurred in both species and these dominate the composition of the fragrance in both cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>). They represent a total of 84.03 % of the compounds identified in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> and 96.78 % in 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic>. However, their relative concentrations differed markedly (e.g. the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene or the monoterpene α-pinene) as well as their general presence/absence in each species (e.g. the sesquiterpene isoledene and the monoterpene (Z)-β-ocimene in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> and the sesquiterpene elemene and the monoterpene myrcene in 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic>) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The sesquiterpenes represent 73.24 % of the fragrance in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> and are dominated by β-caryophyllene (29.36 %), followed by α-humulene (11.76 %) and δ-cadinene (7.05 %). In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic> produced mainly monoterpenes (75.64 %), dominated by terpinolene (55.95 %), α-pinene (5.84 %) and Δ
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>-carene (5.12 %) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In addition to sesqui- and monoterpenes, benzyl esters and oxygenated monoterpenes were also detected but only in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic>, and diterpenes only in 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic> (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>;
