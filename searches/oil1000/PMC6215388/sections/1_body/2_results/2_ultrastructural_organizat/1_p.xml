<p class="p">Despite their differences in shape and size, the cells of the osmophores in both species had the same subcellular bipolar organization and characteristics that indicate their similar secretory function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3A–F</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A–F</xref>). Before anthesis, TEM observations revealed that in both species the epidermal cells have a thicker outer periclinal wall covered by a thin cuticle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>), and dense and organelle-rich cytoplasm interconnected via plasmodesmata in the anticlinal walls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">D</xref>). In the proximal region, where the fragrant compounds are synthetized, all the cells had a large nucleus surrounded by a rough endoplasmic reticulum, and a high number of polyribosomes, mitochondria, small vacuoles and plastids containing starch grains and numerous oil droplets free in the cytosol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3A–F</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A–F</xref>). In both species, some of the cells contained larger vacuoles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">F</xref>) and a larger population of plastids containing starch grains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3F</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">C</xref>). In the apical portion where the secretions are released, the cytoplasm appeared as less dense than in the proximal region due to a greater number of vesicles and vacuoles of various sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic>, dictyosomes occurred in larger quantity with more vesicles than in 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>), and the oil droplets were more common, always located in a peripheral position near the dictyosomes and near the endoplasmic reticulum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4C</xref>). In both species, secretion was observed in the periplasmic space and released by vesicles and vacuoles which merge with the plasma membrane on the apical side of the cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>). The cuticle displayed pectin projections in both species, being slightly thicker in 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic> than in 
 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figs 3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>).
