<p class="p">During anthesis, the vacuoles were larger than during the previous phase and in both species some cells were entirely occupied by a single and large vacuole filled with membranous and flocculent material while others were at different stages of secretion (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6A–C</xref>). There was no difference in types of organelles found in the previous phase, and only their numbers were quite reduced (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6A–C</xref>). In the distal portion of the active cells, vesicles and small vacuoles continued to merge with the plasma membrane and released their secretions to the periplasmic space which crossed the outer periclinal cell wall and the cuticle without disruption (
