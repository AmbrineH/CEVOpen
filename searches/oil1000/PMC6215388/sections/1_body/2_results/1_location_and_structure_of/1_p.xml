<p class="p">In both species, the adaxial surface at the base of each petal displayed prominent longitudinal ridges covered with distinct epidermal cells that were here interpreted as osmophores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">A. humile</italic>, the osmophores were found to be located on narrow ridges following the main vascular bundles from the base up to the longitudinal midpoint of the petals. Their colour was recorded as white in anthetic flowers like the other regions of the petals, but turning distinctly pink later (

 <italic class="italic">M. indica</italic>, the osmophores were found to be located not only on the ridges but also covering most of the lower half of the petals. Their colour was yellow at anthesis, turning brown later (
