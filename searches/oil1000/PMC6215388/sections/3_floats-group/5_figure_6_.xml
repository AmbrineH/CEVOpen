  <p class="p">Ultrastructural features of the osmophores in 
   <italic class="italic">Mangifera indica</italic> at anthesis. (A) General view of the osmophore during anthesis. Most of the cells contain a single large vacuole occupying almost the entire cytoplasm and the organelles are in a peripheral position; the cells are in different stages of secretion. (B) Small vacuoles and oil droplets dispersed in the cytoplasm of the epidermal cells. (C) Fusion of the vacuole with the cell wall before the release of the secretion (*). Ct, cuticle; Cw, cell wall; Mi, mitochondria; Nu, nucleus; Oi, oil droplet; Pl, plastid; Va, vacuole.
