 <p class="p">This study focuses on the first report of osmophores in flowers of the economically important family Anacardiaceae. Flowers of 
  <italic class="italic">Anacardium</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Mangifera</italic> emit a strong and sweet scent suggesting the possible presence of osmophores. Surprisingly, we realized that scent glands were never mentioned in the family. Our study confirms the presence of osmophores in both genera, which are structurally similar. However, the composition of the fragrance shows varies widely between species, with sesquiterpenes dominating the scents of 
  <italic class="italic">Anacardium humile</italic> and monoterpenes in 
  <italic class="italic">Mangifera indica</italic>. Slight variations in their subcellular apparatus are consistent with those found in the composition of their fragrance.
