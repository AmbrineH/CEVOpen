<p class="p">Each one of the isolated
 <italic class="italic"> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oils was dissolved in DMSO (5%) at a concentration of 132 mg/ml. The prepared
 <italic class="italic"> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oils solutions were filter-sterilized and then were serially microdiluted (2-fold) eleven times in sterile nutrient broth. In 96-well plates, the dilution processes were carried out under aseptic conditions. In the microwells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the extracted
 <italic class="italic"> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oils, the concentration of these oils ranged from 0.129 to 66 mg/ml. On the other hand, the concentrations of these essential oils in the microwells assigned to evaluate their antifungal activities ranged from 0.065 to 55 mg/ml. In these plates, microwell number 11 contained essential oil free nutrient broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth. In addition, the microwell number 12 contained essential oil free nutrient broth that was left uninoculated with any of the test microbes. This well was used as a negative control for microbial growth. Microwells number 1 to 11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes. At the time of inoculation, the final concentrations of microbial cells were about 5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> and 0.5–2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml for the tested bacterial pathogens and
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans</italic>, respectively. Each of the included microbes in this study was examined in duplicate for being inhibited by the
 <italic class="italic"> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oils.
