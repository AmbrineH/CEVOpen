<p class="p">Limits of detection (LOD) for the standard fragrant model compounds were also established. 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the LOD (S/N = 3 in the full scan mass spectrum) and the rise and fall times for fragrant model standards (2-methyl-3-furanthiol, methyl butanoate, ethyl methyl sulfide, and 3-methylbutyl acetate). All the detected model standards gave limits of detection in sub ppb range. The rise and fall time for each compound was also measured, and it was observed that the rise times varied from 15 seconds (3-methylbutyl acetate), 16 seconds (ethyl methyl sulfide), and 23 seconds (methyl butanoate) to 31 seconds (2-methyl-3-furanthiol), and also the fall times varied from 23 s seconds (3-methylbutyl acetate), 38 seconds (methyl butanoate), and 41 seconds (ethyl methyl sulfide) to 46 seconds (2-methyl-3-furanthiol). The duration of the rise and fall times varied depending on the analyte(s) and the difference in the physical properties (vapor pressure at 25Â°C) at which the analyte(s) pervaporates from the membrane, which is attributed to the difference in volatility and solubility of the analyte(s) through the membrane [
