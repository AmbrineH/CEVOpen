<p class="p">The ability to detect the individual standard compounds in artificial mixtures encouraged us to apply this experiment to the analysis of the commercial fragrant mixtures using a portable mass spectrometer coupled with DIM probe. For this experiment, 4 essential fragrant oils (i.e., tangerine, papaya, banana, and blue berry muffin) in their pure form were analyzed with DIM probe combined with a portable mass spectrometer. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref"> Figure 5</xref> shows the recorded mass spectra for the fragrant essential oils samples analyzed. A summary of the detected compounds in the essential oil samples (i.e., banana, tangerine, papaya, and blue berry muffin) is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Again the mass spectra recorded showed typical characteristic fragment peaks at
 <italic class="italic"> m/z</italic> 43, 76, and 87 indicating the presence of esters in the mixture that corresponds to the loss of -[CHO] or –[29 Da] methyl neutral loss – [CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> or 15 Da] as observed with the single model compounds (
