<p class="p">The results obtained show the capability of the portable mass spectrometer for online high-throughput rapid screening of different analyses with no sample preparation. However, the use of electron impact (EI) ionisation complicated the mass spectra of the analyte(s) studied. EI ionisation can generate ions with high internal energies (70 eV), hence in-source fragmentation is common and can complicate the interpretation and identification of the fragrant components in the mixture. To overcome this problem softer ionisation techniques (e.g., chemical ionisation (CI)) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) or other ambient ionisation sources forming ions with low internal energies suppressing fragmentation can be used in unison with the portable mass spectrometer [
