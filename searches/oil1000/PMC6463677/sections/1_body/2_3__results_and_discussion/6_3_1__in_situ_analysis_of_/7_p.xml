<p class="p">The simplicity and the ability to analyze different flavors and fragrant samples using a direct membrane probe further enhance the potential of using a portable or miniaturized mass spectrometer for online monitoring, during the production and formulation of the flavors and fragrances, and for forensics investigation. Such a system in operation would be of great value in the flavor and fragrant industry for online monitoring and quality control. The data obtained can also be used in aromatherapy or olfactory experiments in a range of environments. Future work will involve the coupling of softer ionisation source operating at atmospheric pressure such as desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (DAPCI) for a wide range of food flavours.</p>
