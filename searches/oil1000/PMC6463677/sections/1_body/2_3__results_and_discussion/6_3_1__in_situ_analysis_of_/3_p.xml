<p class="p">To confirm the molecular structure of the compounds identified, GC-MS analysis for the essential fragrant oil in question was undertaken (for experimental procedure see supporting information). Representative GC-MS total ion chromatograms for the different compounds analyzed (tangerine, papaya, banana, and blueberry muffin) are shown in Figures

 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> summarizes the list of compounds identified using the DIM probe with a portable mass spectrometer and confirmed using GC-MS experiments (supporting information). The GC-MS data acquired for complex essential fragrant oil samples provides definite confirmation for the different compounds in the essential fragrant oil samples identified using a DIM coupled to portable mass spectrometer experiment. It is important to note that the portable mass spectrometer has a lower mass range (1-200 Da) than the GC-MS limiting its capacity to analyze high molecular weight compounds (see supporting information for more details). For instance, diethyl phthalate (Mw 222) a well-known lower molecular weight endocrine disruptor was found in all the essential fragrant samples studied but was not detected using the DIM probe with a portable mass spectrometer owing to its lower mass range. However, this was detected in all the tangerine, papaya, and blueberry muffin essential oil samples when analyzed with GC-MS (see supporting information for more details).
