<p class="p">Analysis of fragrant components in complex mixtures was also investigated. For these experiments, an artificial mixture was prepared by mixing equal volumes of the model compounds at 10 ppm v/v (i.e., 3-methylbutyl acetate (Mw 130), methyl butanoate (102), ethyl methyl sulfide MW 76), and 2-methyl-3-furanthiol (114)) and analyzed without any further pretreatment. Approximately 5
