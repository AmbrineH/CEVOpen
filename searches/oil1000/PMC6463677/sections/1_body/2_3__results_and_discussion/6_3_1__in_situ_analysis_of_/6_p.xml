<p class="p">Quality control in the flavour and fragrance industry has become a global problem. Being a useful analytical tool for in-situ analysis at the source with minimal sample preparation, a DIM probe coupled with a portable mass spectrometer is proposed as the alternative analytical technique to the analysis of flavours and fragrant samples in complex matrixes such as fragrant essential oils. As demonstrated, DIM probe combined with small footprint mass spectrometer is able to detect the active components of different food flavours and fragrant essential oil with high throughput. Linear signal responses with a dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude were obtained. The limits of detection (LOD) were 2.5 pg (absolute concentration) with good reproducibility (RSD &lt; 10 %). The rise times of 16 to 31 seconds and fall times of 23 to 41 seconds are noteworthy providing a timely and direct analysis of different flavours and fragrants. Future work will involve optimising the membrane parameters to enhanced performance. Because no sample preparation is needed for the analysis, the duty cycle time from ambient air sampling to acquisition of results is 65 seconds or less.</p>
