<p class="p">Results obtained show that the DIM probe combined with a portable experiment retains the advantages of high sensitivity and specificity typical of traditional MS measurements, plus short analysis time (&lt; 1 minute) with no sample pretreatment. Low limits of detection (LOD) of 2.5 pg (absolute concentration) and acceptable reproducibility (RSD of &lt; 10 %) in a variety of untreated, complex essential fragrant oil (i.e., tangerine, papaya, banana, and blue berry muffin) samples were achieved. The strength of the used portable mass spectrometer lies not only in the small size and low weight for in field analysis but also in its ability to be used with a wide range of other mass spectrometry sample inlet methods beyond the DIM probe used in this study [
