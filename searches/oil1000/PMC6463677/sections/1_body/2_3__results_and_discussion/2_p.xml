<p class="p">We chose to study different fragrant compounds such as 3-methylbutyl acetate (MW 130), methyl butanoate (MW 102), ethyl methyl sulfide (MW 76), and 2-Methyl-3-furanthiol (MW 114) because they are commonly used as precursors or active ingredients on a large scale in the composition of many flavors and fragrant commercial products due to their intense and pleasant aromatic smell with low toxicity [

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. As such their detection and quantification is vital to ensure high quality production of consumer products in both food and cosmetic industries [

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. In addition, there is the need to monitor the authenticity and level of additives to combat fragrance product adulteration [

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Before any sample was analyzed, the direct membrane inlet probe with a portable mass spectrometer was first characterized by recording the background mass spectrum of an empty clean flask (i.e., without any sample) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The recorded background mass spectra show highly intense peaks at
 <italic class="italic"> m/z</italic> 18, 28, and 32 for water clusters, nitrogen, and oxygen ions, respectively. The analyte(s) were introduced into the vacuum manifold of the portable mass spectrometer through pervaporation using a DIM probe (PDMS membrane) and ionized by EI, producing spectra which show the main features similar to those of the NIST mass spectra reference library recorded using different instruments [
