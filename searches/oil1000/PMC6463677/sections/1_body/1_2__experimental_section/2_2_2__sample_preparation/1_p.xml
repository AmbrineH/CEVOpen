<p class="p">Standard model compounds were dissolved in methanol solvent (HPLC grade) to make a stock solution at 1000 ppm. Working solutions were prepared by serial dilution with methanol. An artificial mixture consisting of each of the model compounds at 100 ppb concentration was prepared so that approximately the same ion abundances might be recorded. From each solution, approx. 5

The essential fragrant oil mixtures (i.e., tangerine, papaya, banana, and blue berry muffin) were used as supplied without any modification or pre-concentration. In this case, the headspace vapors emitted from the bottles with the essential fragrant oils (10 mL) were exposed in close proximity to the DIM probe for 2 minutes in the open air.
