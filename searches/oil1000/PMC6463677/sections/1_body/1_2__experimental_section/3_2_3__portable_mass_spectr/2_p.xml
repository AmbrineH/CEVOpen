<p class="p">A DIM interface probe was used for preconcentrating and introducing analyte(s) from vapor phase samples in real time through pervaporation [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The membrane used was a thin fine non-sterile flat polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Technical Products, Inc. of Georgia, USA) with thickness of 0.12 mm and sampling area of 33.2 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The membrane was supported by a 0.8 mm thick stainless steel porous frit with 10 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m porosity. The operation of the DIM probe is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1(b)</xref>. Exposure of sample to the membrane was achieved by placing an open flask with 5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L of the sample deposited ~ 2 mm away from the DIM probe. The headspace vapor of the analyte(s) molecules pervaporates through the membrane into the quadrupole mass filter (QMF) under ambient conditions in the open environment. The pervaporated molecules are ionized by electron impact ionization. The distance between the membrane and the (EI) source is 50 mm. Ions are generated from an electron filament biased at 1.6 mA electron emission current and electron energy at 65 eV. The manifold remains closed at all times to maintain a constant pressure. The total response of characteristic ions from the analyte(s) of interest was reconstructed from the total ion current of a full scan mass spectrum in the chromatograph mode. Depending on the analyte(s) being studied the duty cycle of the entire analysis process ranged from 30 to 60 seconds.
