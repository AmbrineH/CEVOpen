<p class="p">Experiments were performed using a portable quadrupole mass spectrometer system (Q-Technologies Ltd., UK), tuned for the optimum continuous detection of the analyte(s) of interest. The main components of the portable mass spectrometer are as follows: a triple filter quadrupole mass spectrometer (consisting of an electron ionization (EI) ion source, mass analyzer, and detector, a vacuum system, an electronics control unit (ECU), and a laptop computer. The mass analyzer is made up of 25 mm rf only prefilter ((Q1) rf only) followed by 125 mm main dc/rf quadrupole mass filter (Q2) and a 25 mm small rf only post filter (Q3) all arranged in series (

 <italic class="italic"> m/z</italic> 1–200 Da with 1 unit mass resolution. The used portable mass spectrometer employs two different types of detectors: (a) a Faraday cup and (b) a Channeltron type electron multiplier. The portable mass spectrometry system is enclosed in a stainless steel chamber pumped down by a TURBOLAB 80 vacuum system obtained (Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum Ltd., Chessington, UK). The TURBOLAB 80 consists of an Oerlikon dual-stage oil-free DIVAC 0.8 T diaphragm pump and a TURBOVAC SL 80 H turbo molecular pump. The overall system pressure was continuously monitored using a digital pressure gauge (model MRT 100) from Pfeiffer Vacuum Ltd. (Newport Pagnell, UK) that uses a Pirani-Cold cathode method of measurement. Total base pressure of the system when the sample inlet valve is fully closed is 2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">–8</sup> Torr. Operating pressure during experiments with the sample valve fully open and the membrane sampling probe attached was stable between 3.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">–6</sup> Torr and 4.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">–6</sup> Torr. All components of the portable mass spectrometer are housed within a stainless steel vacuum chamber weighing less than 20 kg. Data was acquired using a laptop running Windows 7 operating system and data interpretation was performed using the NIST14 mass spectral library. Multiple ion monitoring mode was used to continuously select characteristic mass fragments for the chemical analyte(s) of interest.
