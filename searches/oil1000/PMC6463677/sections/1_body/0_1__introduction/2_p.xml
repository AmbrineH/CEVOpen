<p class="p">Membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) has often been utilized in gathering on-line diagnostic data from complex mixtures present in air or water such as those found in reacting chemical streams [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], environmental monitoring [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and security and pharmaceutical intermediates [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Exposure of the sample stream to a semipermeable membrane can be used to selectively introduce compounds present in the fluid matrix into the mass spectrometer by pervaporation [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The rate of sample transfer across the membrane depends on its solubility, diffusivity and the membrane material [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Compounds that are highly soluble on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane, such as the trihalomethanes, can be measured at high parts-per-trillion (ppt) to low parts per billion (ppb) levels [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Once the analyte(s) are introduced into the vacuum system, neutral molecules in vapor phase can be ionized by an electron impact ionization source (EI) or glow discharge source (GDEI) [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. MIMS is thus characterized by its simplicity, speed and sensitivity. However, it has in the past been limited to laboratory settings due to the cost, size, high vacuum, and power requirement required of mass spectrometers [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>].
