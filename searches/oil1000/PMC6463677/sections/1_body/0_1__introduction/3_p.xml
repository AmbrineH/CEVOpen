<p class="p">The development of small footprint portable mass spectrometers is analogous to that of portable computing devices. Miniaturized, light weight, low cost mass spectrometers combined with a membrane sampling system could expand applicability. Possible deployments range from space exploration, food safety monitoring [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>–
