 <p> Representative EI mass spectra of fragrant model compounds recorded using a DIM probe combined with a portable mass spectrometer. Accurate amounts of analyte were pitted into a flask and introduced into the manifold of the portable MS through a DIM probe, 5 Î¼L, viz 10 ppb. (a) 2-methylfuran-3-thiol (Mw 114), (b) methyl butanoate (Mw 102), (c) ethyl methyl sulfide (Mw 76), and (d) 3-methylbutyl acetate (Mw 130). </p>
