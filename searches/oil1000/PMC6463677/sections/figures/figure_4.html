 <p> In-situ analysis of standard model compounds in an artificial; (a) mixture of equal volumes of 10 ppm of methylbutyl acetate, 2-mehtyl-3-furanthiol, methyl butanoate, and ethyl methyl sulfide 10 ppm (v/v) using a direct membrane probe coupled to a portable mass spectrometer. Approx. 5 Î¼L of the mixture was deposited in the flask and left for 2 hours. The headspace vapor of the mixture was detected using a portable mass spectrometer coupled to a direct membrane probe and (b) shows the mass spectrum of the real banana headspace vapor measured using DIM probe with a portable mass spectrometer. </p>
