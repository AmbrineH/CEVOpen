<p id="Par56" class="p">In previous research, (+)-borneol as an intermediate product of camphor biosynthesis has been proved to be derived from the conversion of GPP to bornyl pyrophosphate (BPP) by the action of bornyl pyrophosphate synthetase (BPPS) and BPP was subsequently hydrolyzed to borneol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. BPPS, a metal-requiring monoterpene cyclase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], has to date been cloned only from 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula angustifolia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Linalool, an acyclic monoterpene, is a main product of linalool synthases and bi-functional synthases for both linalool and nerolidol production have been characterized in many plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. It is interesting that three of the mono-TPSs, 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like3</italic>, showed an up-regulated expression in the borneol-type compared to the linalool-type in this study, and their protein were aligned with some linalool synthases and borneol pyrophosphate synthases that have been published already (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). However, TPS14 is a linalool synthase expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> flowers [

 <italic class="italic">.</italic> It has been reported that the specific biochemical functions of individual TPS family members cannot be predicted based on sequence similarity alone, as changes in only a few amino acids can lead to drastic changes in the terpenoid profile of a given TPS enzyme [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. In addition, many TPSs are multi-product enzymes and can often give rise to mixtures of the same compounds in differing proportions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. Furthermore, linalool biosynthesis can be altered by alternative transcript splicing of key biosynthetic enzymes in 
 <italic class="italic">Camellia sinensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. These make it difficult to determine transcript abundance of individual 
 <italic class="italic">TPS</italic> unigenes using qRT-PCR. Nevertheless, 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like3</italic> may play an important role in terpenoid accumulation in the borneol-type of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora.</italic> The specific function of these three genes remains to be further verified.
