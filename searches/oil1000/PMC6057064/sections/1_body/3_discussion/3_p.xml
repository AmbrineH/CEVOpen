<p id="Par54" class="p">The regulation of plant MVA and MEP pathway gene expression occurs mainly at the transcriptional level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. HMGR and DXS are two rate-limiting enzymes in the MVA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] and MEP pathway, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. Thirty expressed unigenes which were identified to be highly homologous with 14 known enzymes have been annotated into the MVA and MEP pathways of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>, and shown to exhibit a high transcriptome expression level in both two chemotypes. The MEP pathway provides precursors for the synthesis of monoterpenes and diterpenes in plastids, whereas sesquiterpenes are derived from precursors of the MVA pathway in the cytosol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Cross talk between these two different terpene backbone pathways has been documented, whereas the relative contribution of each pathway to the biosynthesis of the various class of terpenes remain uncertain.
