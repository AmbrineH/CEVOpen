<p id="Par53" class="p">In recent years, genes related to terpenoids biosynthesis have been extensively studied in different plants. Terpenoids are rich in the Lauraceae family, while only several genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis have been successfully identified and functionally characterized so far [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">Litsea cubeba</italic>, three TPS genes encoding monoterpenoid synthase enzymes were isolated and functionally catalyzed the formation of trans-ocimene, Î±-thujene and (+)-sabinene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. In 
 <italic class="italic">Laurus nobilis</italic>, TPS enzymes which catalyze the formation of 1,8-cineole, cadinenes and geranyllinalool were characterized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. The bioinformatic analysis presented here aimed to discover genes involved in terpenes synthesis and their precursors in the MVA and MEP pathways. A total of 67 expressed unigenes likely involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were isolated from the transcriptome profile of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. Multiple unigenes were annotated as the same enzyme, and these unigenes may represent various alternatively spliced transcripts or members of a gene family.
