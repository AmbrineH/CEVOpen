<p id="Par52" class="p">Monoterpenes are the main components in leaf extracts in many members of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum</italic>, such as 
 <italic class="italic">C. osmophloeum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">C. burmannii</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">C. kanehirae</italic> Hay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. In this study, 24 components were identified in borneol and linalool-chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. An analysis of the components showed that the essential oil or crystal isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> consists primarily of monoterpenes with very minor quantities of sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. However, the most prevalent monoterpene differed between the two chemotypes, with a high content of (âˆ’)-borneol in the borneol-type and a higher content of linalool in the linalool-type than in the borneol-type. Therefore, the different major monoterpenes mainly contributed to the differences between the essential oil of the two chemotypes.
