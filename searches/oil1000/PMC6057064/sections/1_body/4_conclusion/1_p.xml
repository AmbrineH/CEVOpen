<p id="Par57" class="p">In this study, we conducted leaf transcriptome and metabolic analysis between linalool- and borneol-chemotypes in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. This data provides a comprehensive coverage of terpenoid biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. Monoterpenes were identified as the major components in the leaf of the two chemotypes. Beta-linalool was the most abundant component in the linalool-chemotype while (âˆ’)-borneol was the major component in the borneol-chemotype. A comparison of the transcriptomes of these two chemotypes led to the identification of 2863 differentially expressed unigenes. Analysis of these unigenes provides an insight into the gene expression patterns and biological processes active in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that terpene synthase activity and oxidoreductase activity could explain the differential accumulation of terpenoids between borneol and linalool chemotypes in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. A total of 67 candidate unigenes were identified to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. Most notably, three unigenes involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis were identified. Further functional studies are needed to elucidate regulatory mechanisms in the formation and accumulation of terpenoids. The transcriptome sequences and gene expression profile provide valuable information for understanding the accumulation of terpenoids in different chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. The study also provides worthy resources for bioengineering and synthetic biology study of terpenoids in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>.
