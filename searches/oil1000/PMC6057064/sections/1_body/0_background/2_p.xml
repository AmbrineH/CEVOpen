<p id="Par32" class="p">Terpenoids (or terpenes) constitute the largest class of structurally diverse metabolites, with more than 55,000 members identified in living organisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Based on the number of 5-carbon units, terpenoids are classified into monoterpene (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30), tetraterpenes (C40) and polyterpenes which have more than eight 5C units [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Borneol and linalool, like all other monoterpenes, are formed from the isomeric 5-carbon building blocks isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Two independent pathways participate in the biosynthesis of IPP and DMAPP in plants. In the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, the biosynthesis of IPP/DMAPP in plastids begins with pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>], whereas in the cytosol and peroxisomes, IPP/DMAPP formation occurs from the condensation of acetyl-CoA in the mevalonate acid (MVA) pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. The equilibrium of IPP and DMAPP is controlled by IPP Delta-isomerase (IDI), which reversibly converts IPP to DMAPP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. The condensation of the C5 precursors leads to the formation of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes by the activation of terpene synthases (TPS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Terpenoid synthesis is often correlated with the induction of TPS gene expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>] and several monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases have been isolated and characterized from various plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. Besides the regulation at the level of terpene synthase activity, the induction of precursor biosynthetic genes has also been described [
