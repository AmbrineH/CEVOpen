 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum camphora</italic>, a member of the Lauraceae family, is an evergreen broad-leaf tree indigenous to southern China and Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. The essential oil or crystal distilled from 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> has considerable economic importance as a source of food preservative and additive, and as raw materials for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The chemical compositions of different 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> tissues have been previously investigated, and mono- and sesquiterpenes were found abundant in the leaves and twigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. There is chemical polymorphism in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. According to the signature constituent in leaf, 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> was classified into at least five different chemical variants (chemotypes), including linalool- (58–92%), borneol- (67–82%), camphor- (54–97%), cineole- (32–52%), and nerolidol-types (16–57%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. In recent years, 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> has become of increasing importance as a source of essential oils, especially for the production of natural borneol and linalool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Borneol, a bicyclic monoterpene alcohol, has been widely used in food and drug industries typically in folk medicine in China and India. Interestingly, natural borneol has been used to increase the permeabilities of the intestinal mucosa and blood-brain barrier to improve the oral bioavailability of some poorly permeable drugs [
