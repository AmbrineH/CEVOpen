<p id="Par34" class="p">In light of the chemical polymorphism evident in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>, it is of interest to search for potential differences in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway in different chemotypes. We have used metabolic analysis and transcriptome sequencing in order to discover potential monoterpene synthases present in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> chemotypes. In the current study, the leaf contents and compositions of terpenoids in borneol- and linalool-types was analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and their transcriptomes compared. After functional annotation and classification, the genes involved in the MEP/MVA pathways and terpene synthesis in both chemotypes were identified. The results contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying differences in terpenoid biosynthesis between
