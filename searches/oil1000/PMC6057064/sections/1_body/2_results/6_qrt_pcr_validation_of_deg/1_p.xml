<p id="Par51" class="p">To validate the expression patterns of terpenoid biosynthetic genes obtained from RNA-Seq analysis, qRT-PCR was conducted to examine the expression levels of twelve unigenes in the two chemotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The expression levels of these selected genes from qRT-PCR analyses were generally consistent with those deduced from their fragments per kilobase per million mapped (FPKM) data from RNA-Seq (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). The correlation between the qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq measurements was evaluated and the coefficient of determination (or R-squared) was 0.9231(Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). The obtained results confirm the reliability of the transcriptomic profiling data estimated from RNA-Seq data. Moreover, the expression of these genes has also been validated in three other chemotypes (camphor-, cineole- and nerolidol-types) by qRT-PCR except for borneol- and linalool-types of
