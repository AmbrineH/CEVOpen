<p id="Par45" class="p">Based on sequence homology, 51,768 annotated unigenes were categorized into three ontologies with 56 GO terms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). Within the category of biological process (BP) category, genes matched to 25 GO terms, the most highly represented of which were ‘cellular process’ (28,998), ‘metabolic process’ (27,125) and ‘single-organism process’ (20,998). For the molecular function (MF) category, ‘binding’ (27,919) and ‘catalytic activity’ (22,472) were the two most abundant of 21 GO terms. The largest associated term within the 10 GO terms of the cellular component (CC) category was ‘cell’ (15,526).
