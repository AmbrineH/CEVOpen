<p id="Par44" class="p">To identify the active biological pathways in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>, the assembled unigenes were mapped to the KEGG annotation system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). A total of 25,512 unigenes were matched in 19 metabolic pathways and ‘translation’ (2562), ‘carbohydrate metabolism (2,215) and ‘folding, sorting and degradation’ (1,184) were the three richest pathways. In addition, 490 unigenes were mapped to the ‘Metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides’, including ‘Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis’ (ko00900, 147), ‘Monoterpenoid biosynthesis’ (ko00902, 12), ‘Sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis’ (ko00909, 44), ‘Diterpenoid biosynthesis’ (ko00904, 58), ‘Limonene and pinene degradation’ (ko00903, 88), ‘Carotenoid biosynthesis’ (ko00906, 151), ‘Brassinosteroid biosynthesis’ (ko00905, 23) and ‘Zeatin biosynthesis’ (ko00908, 98).
