<p id="Par49" class="p">To explore the regulatory mechanisms for the accumulation patterns of different terpenoids in 
 <italic class="italic">C.camphora</italic>, the expression profiles of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were analyzed. A total of 67 expressed unigenes encoding terpenoid biosynthesis enzymes were identified in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). The expression data of all these unigenes is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, as well as the FPKM values in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>. Most of the genes encoding key enzymes in terpenoid backbone pathway (MEP and MVA pathway, KEGG entry ko00900) exhibited a high transcriptome expression level, were not differentially expressed between the two chemotypes except for one HMGR and two MCS unigenes. Interestingly, unigenes in the MEP pathway show a higher expression level than those of the MVA pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Both MEP and MVA pathways generate IPP and its isomer DMAPP, which are precursors of the production of terpenoids. It is indicated that active biosynthesis of building blocks make contribution to a large accumulation of different class of terpenoids which is consistent with our composition analysis of leaf extract in 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>).
