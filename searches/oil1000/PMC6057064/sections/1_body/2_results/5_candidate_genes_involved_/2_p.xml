<p id="Par50" class="p">In addition, we characterized twenty-four unigenes encoding terpenoid synthase, including eight in monoterpenoid biosynthesis, seven in diterpenoid biosynthesis and nine in sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis(Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Among them, three monoterpenoid synthase unigenes, one diterpenoid synthase unigene and two unigenes involved in sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid synthase were up-regulated in the borneol chemotype, while only one diterpenoid synthase unigenes were up-regulated in the linalool chemotype. Overall, our results of the high expression levels for the enzymes in terpenoid backbone pathway are consistent with a high rate of terpenoid synthesis, and suggest that the different expression level of TPS genes in the two chemotypes may be the reason for their different terpenoid compositions.
