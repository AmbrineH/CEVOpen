<p id="Par41" class="p">Specimens of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> leaves from two chemotypes (F_L1 and F_L2 were linalool-types, L_L1 and L_L2 were borneol-types) were obtained from the garden of Jiangxi Academy of Forestry and the leaf extracts were isolated by water distillation. There were no morphological differences in between the leaves from the two chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Interestingly, the leaf essential oil extracts of the linalool-type remained as oil liquids, whereas that of the borneol-type formed crystals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The compositions of leaf essential oil from the fresh leaves were analyzed with GC-MS. A total of 24 terpenoid compounds in leaf distillates were detected, and monoterpenes were the main constituents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The major components with yields &gt; 0.1 mg.g
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> fresh weight are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>. In the extracts of both chemotypes, the signature compound was present in far higher content than all other compounds. In the linalool-type, the most abundant compound, beta-linalool, yielded 13.67 mg.g
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> FW, followed by (E)-nerolidol in yields of 0.38 mg g
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> FW. The principal constituent of the borneol-type was (−)-borneol (14.86 mg g
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> FW), followed by borneol acetate (0.65 mg g
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> FW). To investigate the biosynthesis of major compounds, we proceeded with the analysis of the transcriptomes of the two 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> chemotypes.
