<p id="Par46" class="p">To fully explore potential differential gene expression between borneol and linalool chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>, the clean reads were mapped to the unigene database. The normalization of gene expression data was performed using multiple correction methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], and the differentially-expressed genes between the borneol-type and linalool-type were characterized by DESeq with 
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 and |log2.Fold_change| &gt; 1, resulting in a total of 2863 unigenes identified, consisting of 1714 up-regulated and 1149 down-regulated genes in the borneol-type relative to the linalool-type, 738 unigenes of which were borneol-type unique, 524 unigenes of which were linalool-type unique, and 1601 mixed assembly unigenes in the two chemotypes. The distribution of these genes is shown in Fig.
