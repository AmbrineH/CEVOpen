<p id="Par47" class="p">To explore the difference of metabolic pathways between borneol chemotype and linalool chemotype, enriched KEGG pathway analysis has been performed using 2863 differentially expressed genes. The top 20 over-presented KEGG pathways categories were presented as dot plots (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). The most significantly enriched pathway for up-regulated DEGs in the borneol chemotype relative to the linalool type was the “monoterpenoid biosynthesis” pathway, with three DEGs annotated. For the up-regulated DEGs in linalool chemotype, the most significantly enriched pathway was “folate biosynthesis”.
