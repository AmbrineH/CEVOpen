<p id="Par48" class="p">In the GO enrichment analysis, 124 up-regulated DEGs between the borneol-type and linalool-type profiles were enriched and matched in 7 GO terms that belonged to biological process and molecular function (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). The structure of GO can be described in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which each GO term is depicted as a node and the parentages as an arrow. Peroxidase activity and terpene synthase activity were significantly enriched (Fig.
