<p id="Par37" class="p">Total RNAs from all samples were extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilde, Germany), and immediately frozen at − 80 °C until use. RNA degradation and contamination were monitored on 1% agarose gels. RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). A total amount of 1.5 μg of RNA extracted from each leaf sample was used for transcriptome analysis using Illumina’s kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Four sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The cDNA library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and paired-end reads were generated.</p>
