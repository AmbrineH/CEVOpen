<p id="Par35" class="p">Leaves of linalool- (No. JF1, JF2) and borneol-type (No. JL1, JL4) 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> were collected for chemical analysis and RNA sequencing from trees grown at the experimental tree farm of the Jiangxi Academy of Forestry in Nanchang, China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Two 8-year-old trees of each chemotype were used as biological replicates. The two replications for the linalool chemotype were termed F_L1 and F_L2, and the borneol chemotype were termed L_L1 and L_L2. Three chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> (camphor-, cineole- and nerolidol-types) were obtained from the campus of Nanjing Forestry University for further analysis, the compositions of their leaf extracts are listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. All the samples for RNA extraction were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored at − 80 °C. At the same time, fresh leaves of different chemotypes were obtained for essential oil isolation.
