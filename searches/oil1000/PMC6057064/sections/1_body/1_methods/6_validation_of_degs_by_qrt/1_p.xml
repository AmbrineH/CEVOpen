<p id="Par40" class="p">Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Takara, Dalian, China) and the ABI ViiA 7 Real-time PCR platform. The primers were aligned to the target gene sequence using Oligo 7.0 (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO, USA). The qRT-PCR analyses were performed for the following genes: 
 <italic class="italic">GPS_like</italic> (Cluster-13,185.62746), 
 <italic class="italic">HMGR_like</italic> (Cluster-13,185.61515), 
 <italic class="italic">HDS_like1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">HDS_like2</italic> (Clusters-13,185.59980 and 13,185.80000, respectively),

 <italic class="italic">DXR_like</italic> (Cluster-13,185.63961),

 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TPS14_like3</italic> (Clusters-13,185.98748, 13,185.75128 and 13,185.81558, respectively), 
 <italic class="italic">SDR_like1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SDR_like2</italic> (short-chain dehydrogenases, Clusters 13,185.106850 and 13,185.105357) and one putative linalool synthase gene were submitted to GenBank (accession no. XJ028228, 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>). Details of the primers used for the qRT-qPCR assay are listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>, and sequences of these unigenes are listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>. The experiments were performed with three technical replicates that contained 30 ng cDNA, 10 μL of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, and 600 nM primers and nuclease free water with a final volume of 20 μL per reaction. The Ct values for all genes were normalized to the Ct value of actin (
