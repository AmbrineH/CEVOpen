<p id="Par36" class="p">The fresh leaves of each sample were hydrodistilled with a modified Clevenger-type apparatus for 2 h until the extraction was completed. The terpenoid composition analysis of each sample were performed on a SHIMADZU QP2020 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (SHIMADZU Corporation, Japan), fitted with a DB-5-MS silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a constant flowrate of 0.6 mL/min. The GC temperature program were as follows: 50 °C for 3 min, a gradient of 50–180 °C over 16.25 min followed by holding at 180 °C for 1 min, then a gradient of 180–280 °C over 10 min followed by holding at 280 °C 5 min. Alkanes were used as reference points in the calculation of relative retention indices. The GC inlet was operated at 280 °C in splitless mode with 0.6 μL injection volume. The quadrupole MS operating parameters were set as follows: electron ionization (EI) mode; EI source, 70 eV; transfer line temperature, 250 °C; ion source temperature, 200 °C; emission current, 150 μA; examination voltage, 500 V; 0.2 s for the full scan mode; scan mass range, 29–450 m/z. The peaks were identified by comparing their retention time with that of the known standards, which were determined under the same conditions. A library search was carried out using the Wiley GC-MS Library and the TBAM Library of Essential Oil Constituents.</p>
