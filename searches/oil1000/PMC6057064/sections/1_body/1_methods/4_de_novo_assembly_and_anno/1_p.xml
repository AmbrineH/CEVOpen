<p id="Par38" class="p">For the assembly library, raw data (raw reads) in FASTQ format were first processed through CASAVA base-calling. Trimmomatic (version 0.36) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>] were used to trim and crop FASTQ data as well as to remove adapters. The parameters of removing reads containing N or low quality (reads containing more than 50% bases with Q-value ≤20) were default with paired end mode. All the libraries were mixed together to generate an assembly using Trinity (version r20140413pl) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>], and default parameters were used except for the minimum kmer coverage setting to 2. The assembly results were further clustered and filtered to get the non-redundant unigenes by Corset (version 1.07) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Gene function was annotated using BLAST program with an E-value cut-off of 1e
