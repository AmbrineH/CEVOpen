<p id="Par39" class="p">The number of fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) was used to estimate the relative expression levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] and the FPKM of unigenes were estimated using the software RSEM v1.2.15 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>], with the Trimmed Mean of M-values method. Differential expression analysis of two chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic> samples was performed using read counts with the DESeq R package (v1.10.1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. The resulting 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-values were adjusted to Q-values to compensate for multiple hypothesis testing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. Genes with an adjusted Q-value &lt;â€‰0.05 found by DESeq were assigned as differentially expressed. GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed using the GOseq R package (version 1.10.0) based on the Wallenius non-central hypergeometric distribution, which can adjust for gene length bias in DEGs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. KEGG enrichment analysis was performed with KOBAS version 2.0.12 software [
