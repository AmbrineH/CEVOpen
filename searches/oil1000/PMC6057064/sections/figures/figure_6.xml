  <p class="p">qRT-PCR validation of selected genes in linalool and borneol chemotypes of 
   <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> The gray bars represent the relative expression determined with RT-qPCR (left y-axis) and the black bars represent the level of expression (FPKM) of the transcripts (right y-axis). The relative expression levels were estimated from the threshold of PCR cycle with the delta-delta CT method. The error bars indicate the standard errors from two biological and three technical replicates. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Scatter plots show simple linear regression and the R-squared (R
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>) between RNA sequencing data and qRT-PCR validation data expressed in terms of log
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>FC. The fold change (FC) was calculated as the ratio between the linalool-type and borneol-type of 
   <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>
