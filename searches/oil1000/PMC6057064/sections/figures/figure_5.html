 <p> Differentially expressed genes in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis in C. camphora. Terpenoids biosynthesis pathway showing the subset of nodes or enzymes that constitute the process. Enzymes expression patterns are indicated at the side of each step with the value of log(FPKM+â€‰1). The expression pattern of each unigene is shown within two-column grids, with the left column representing the linalool-type and the right one representing the borneol-type. Significantly differentially expressed unigenes are blue. CCAT, Acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase; HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH); MVK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; MCS, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase; IDI, isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; GGPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase </p>
