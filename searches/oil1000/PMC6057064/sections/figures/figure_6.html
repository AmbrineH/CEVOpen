 <p> qRT-PCR validation of selected genes in linalool and borneol chemotypes of C. camphora. a The gray bars represent the relative expression determined with RT-qPCR (left y-axis) and the black bars represent the level of expression (FPKM) of the transcripts (right y-axis). The relative expression levels were estimated from the threshold of PCR cycle with the delta-delta CT method. The error bars indicate the standard errors from two biological and three technical replicates. b Scatter plots show simple linear regression and the R-squared (R 2) between RNA sequencing data and qRT-PCR validation data expressed in terms of log 2FC. The fold change (FC) was calculated as the ratio between the linalool-type and borneol-type of C. camphora </p>
