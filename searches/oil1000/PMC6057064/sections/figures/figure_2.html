 <p> Annotation information of assembled unigenes in C. camphora. a Venn diagram of the distribution of annotation information from different public databases. b. KEGG annotation of putative proteins. The y-axis indicates the name of the KEGG metabolic pathway. The x-axis indicates the percentage of the number of unigenes annotated to the pathway out of the total number of unigenes annotated. The unigenes were divided into five branches according to the KEGG metabolic pathway: Cellular Processes (A), Environmental Information Processing (B), Genetic Information Processing (C), Metabolism (D) and Organismal Systems (E). c. GO classification of unigenes in C. camphora. Gene Ontology terms are classified into three main categories: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF) </p>
