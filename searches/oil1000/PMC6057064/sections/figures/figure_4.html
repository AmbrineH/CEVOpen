 <p> GO enrichment analysis of up-regulated DEGs. a GO enrichment histogram. The x- axis represent the enriched GO terms. The y-axis represents number of DEGs. b Thumbnails view of DAGs on BP and MF. The nodes are colored according to the q-value: red indicates high confidence level ( q-value &lt; 0.01), yellow indicates common confidence level (0.01 &lt;  q-value &lt; 0.05), and blank nodes are associated terms. The node horizontal position indicates the depth of GO terms. In every node, four rows represent detailed information of GO ID, GO term, q-value, and DEG numbers with background gene numbers. c Original model of the GO ancestor chart. Terms linked with an arrow have a relationship of “Is a”, i.e., “term A is a term B” means that term A is a subtype of term B </p>
