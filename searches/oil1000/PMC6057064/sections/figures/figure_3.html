 <p> Number of and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Borneol-type and Linalool-type of C. camphora. Red: upregulated genes in the borneol-type; Blue: downregulated genes in the borneol-type. Relative expression of DEGs selected at Q-value &lt;â€‰0.05. The darker colors of bars represent larger change in expression. The fold change (FC) was calculated as the ratio between the borneol-type and linalool-type. The x- axis represents the range of Log 2 FC. The y-axis indicates the number of detected DEGs </p>
