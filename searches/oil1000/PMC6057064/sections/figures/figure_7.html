 <p> qRT-PCR validation of selected genes in five chemotypes of C. camphora. Five chemotypes include camphor-, cineole-, nerolidol-, borneol- and linalool-types. Relative expression levels were estimated from the threshold of the PCR cycle by the Delta CT method. The values indicate the means of two biological replications </p>
