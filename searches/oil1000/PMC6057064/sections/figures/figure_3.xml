  <p class="p">Number of and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Borneol-type and Linalool-type of 
   <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. Red: upregulated genes in the borneol-type; Blue: downregulated genes in the borneol-type. Relative expression of DEGs selected at Q-value &lt;â€‰0.05. The darker colors of bars represent larger change in expression. The fold change (FC) was calculated as the ratio between the borneol-type and linalool-type. The 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>- axis represents the range of Log
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> FC. The 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>-axis indicates the number of detected DEGs
