  <p class="p">Differentially expressed genes in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis in 
   <italic class="italic">C. camphora</italic>. Terpenoids biosynthesis pathway showing the subset of nodes or enzymes that constitute the process. Enzymes expression patterns are indicated at the side of each step with the value of log(FPKM+â€‰1). The expression pattern of each unigene is shown within two-column grids, with the left column representing the linalool-type and the right one representing the borneol-type. Significantly differentially expressed unigenes are blue. CCAT, Acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase; HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH); MVK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; MCS, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase; IDI, isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; GGPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase
