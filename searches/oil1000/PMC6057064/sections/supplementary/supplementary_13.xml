   <p class="p">Enriched KEGG pathway analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes between borneol- and linalool-chemotypes. F_L was linalool-type, L_L was borneol-type. The y- axis indicates the pathway name; the x-axis indicates the enrichment factor corresponding to the pathway. The Rich factor means that the ratio of the enriched DEGs number and the number of background genes in corresponding pathway. The greater the Rich factor, the greater the degree of enrichment. The 
    <italic class="italic">q</italic>-value is represented by the color of the dot (scale provided to the right of each panel). The number of DEGs is represented by the size of the dots. (PDF 227Â kb)
