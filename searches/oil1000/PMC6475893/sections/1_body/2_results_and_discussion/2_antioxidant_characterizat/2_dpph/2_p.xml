 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nadeem et al., 2015</xref>). The WHE, at 37.5 μg/mL, indicated a scavenging effect of 56.40% so as to augment to 91.73% at 600 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The BHT had higher antioxidant activity than WHE inhibiting 92.3% of the DPPH radical at 600 μg/mL. On the contrary, by decreasing the sample concentrations, the WHE showed more antioxidant ability than BHT. The scavenging capabilities of WHE exhibited concentration dependant effects, the higher the concentration of WHE with the stronger antioxidant activity. Espı'n et al. demonstrated that the radical scavenging capacity of the lipid fraction of walnut oil was dependent on the amount of tocopherols

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bakkalbasi et al. (2013)</xref>, methanolic walnut extract with 38.8–85.2% inhibition had been authenticated as the strongest free radical scavengers among other nuts.

The tocopherols accompanied by 76–98% to the total antioxidant activity of every nut oils and
