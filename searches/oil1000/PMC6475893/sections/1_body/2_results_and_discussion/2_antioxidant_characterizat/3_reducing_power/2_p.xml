<p id="p0115" class="p">This assay is often used to evaluate the ability of an antioxidant to donate electrons. This method is founded on the decrease of the ferricyanide complex to the ferrous ion. In the present study, at all concentrations especially at 0.25 mg/ml, WHE has more reducing capacity than BHT. As it showed at 0.25 and 2 mg/ml concentrations the lowest (1.5 and 1.76 mg/ml in BHT and WHE, respectively) and highest (2.08 and 2.16 mg/ml in BHT and WHE, respectively) reducing power respectively (
