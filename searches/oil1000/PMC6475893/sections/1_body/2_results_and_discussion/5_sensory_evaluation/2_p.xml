 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 7</xref>. It was observed that the color scores of the TB sample treated with WHE 0. 5% were not in the acceptable range. Among the treated TB, the samples treated with the control and WHE 0.05% had the highest sensory attributes score. There was no difference in flavor and texture of the TB samples treated with WHE 0.5% and WHE 0.05% was considered. The flavor and overall acceptability scores of WHE 0.05% and WHE 0.1% were not different together. The scores of sensorial evaluation of the treated samples were decreased by WHE. This is due to the unpleasant effect of herbal extract and essential oils. The total amount of PV and free fatty acids may be the cause of the expansion of negative flavor changes in butter throughout the storage (
