<p id="p0155" class="p">The formation of free fatty acids are due to hydrolysis as well as by cleavage and oxidation of lipids double bonds. The increase in free fatty acid contents of all the treatments and control during the storage of 90 days contributed to this phenomenon (

On the other hand, least increase in FFA was in sample treated with WHE 0.1% and BHT throughout storage period which could be due to the presence of more antioxidant compounds like phenolic compounds in WHE which is in agreement with the results reported by 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shende et al. (2014)</xref>. A free fatty acid value of fresh butter which is between 0.14 to 39% is generally assumed to be passable for butter fat; a higher content of free fatty acid is related to poor storage condition (

In the present study all treated samples were in this level on 0 day (0.25, 0.32, 0.29, 0.3, 0.26 and 0.26 in the control, WHE 0.5%, WHE 0.1%, WHE 0.5%, BHT and tocopherol, respectively). Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in free fatty acid between the WHE 0.5%, WHE 0.1% treated samples and BHT on 90 days (see
