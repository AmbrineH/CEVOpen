<p id="p0130" class="p">Evaluation of PV has been extensively practical to butter with mixed results about the sensory realization of off-flavors. This value is considered to be the one of the most efficient methods for determining the initial stages of oxidative rancidity. Changes in PV of samples for 90 days are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. In this study, which is in agreement with 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Savage et al. (2001)</xref> research, the mean of walnut PV at day 0 was 0.2 meq O2/kg oil. The Control group had detected more PV compared with the treated samples during storage time (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). With increasing storage time, the PV tends to increase more rapidly in WHE 0.05% treated sample, in comparison with WHE 0.5%, WHE 0.1, BHT and tocopherol samples. The PV of all groups was higher at the last day of storage time compared to the 0 and 45 days of storage. The current outcomes are in accordance with 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Simsek (2011)</xref>, who showed that the least PV of butter was at the beginning stages of storage time. 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jebson, McDowell, and Russell (1974)</xref> concluded an increase in the PV of butter treatments kept which were at 4 °C after 120 and 240 days. At the end of storage period, control sample revealed the highest PV of 1.42 as compared to 0.29 (meq/kg), in tocopherol treated sample which are lower than the threshold (5 meq O2/kg) which shows the commencement of the lipid peroxidation (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAO, 1992</xref>). The antioxidant activities of WHE increased with increasing amount of extract. The sample treated with tocopherol was found to be the least advancement of peroxides than other samples of the peroxides. The variation in peroxides development in tocopherol and BHT samples could be caused by the existence of various antioxidant compounds (
