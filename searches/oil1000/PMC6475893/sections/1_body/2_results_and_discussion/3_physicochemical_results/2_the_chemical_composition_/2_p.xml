<p id="p0125" class="p">Fat, salt, SNF, and moisture of the butter used in this study were 79.7 ± 0.8%, 0.3 ± 0.04%, 5.2 ± 0.6% and 15.1 ± 0.2% respectively. In this study, butter was prepared using traditional method. In this method, because of the extraction of butter from yogurt, some buttermilk containing protein, phosphorus and calcium also enters the final product, so the amount of SNF is higher than commercial butter. Other results were consistent with the standards.</p>
