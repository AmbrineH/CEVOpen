<p id="p0140" class="p">TotoxV is thought to combine evidence about the past history of the oil (AV) with the present state of the oil (PV). TotoxV and the Schaal oven changes in samples are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. TotoxV of control sample generally was the highest value between treatments. By increasing the amount of the WHE, TotoxV values were decreased which can be correlated to the presence of phenolic agents, which offered resistance against the PV in the accelerated oxidation reaction. Tocopherol treated sample with 1.66 ± 0.29 and control sample with 7.51 ± 1.2 had the lowest and highest TotoxV, respectively. 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jahurul et al. (2014)</xref> concluded that tocopherols the same as antioxidants can stabilize oil. No significant differences were found in the WHE 0.1% and WHE 0.05% incorporated samples.
