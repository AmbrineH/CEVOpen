<p id="p0145" class="p">Ordinarily, Schaal oven method is applied for evaluation of oxidation of oils but it is also applied in dairy industry. The control sample showed the highest Schaal test value followed by tocopherol sample. There are no significant differences among the control, WHE 0.1% and tocopherol butter samples in Schaal test. The addition of WHE to TB decreased the oxidation of treated samples in comparison with the control group. In the present study WHE 0.5% and BHT showed more antioxidant ability than other samples. By increasing the level of phenolic substances, the number of hydroxyl groups present in the reaction increased. Therefore, the possibility of hydrogen conveyed to free radicals will increase (
