 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) the control had the highest AV, thus showed a higher level of oxidation that might be due to the presence of prooxidants, which speeded the autoxidation process. BHT and WHE 0.05% treated samples were found to be the most effective in reducing the oxidation of butter in this test. Addition of BHT and WHE 0.05% was more competent in the retardation of oxidation products and significantly lower AV values of the experimental samples could be attributed to the phenolic antioxidants naturally present in WHE. In this study, AV of sample treated with tocopherol was increased gradually until 45 days (1.94 ± 0.18 on 45 days) of storage then decreased to (1.08 ± 0.07 on 90 days). The decrease in AV after 45 days may be due to the dimerization of two aldehydes to form stable malonaldehydes (
