<p id="p0160" class="p">Presence of substances such as serum and water affect storage time of butter because they are a suitable medium for spoilage microorganisms. The growth of proteolytic organisms such as lactobacillus, yeasts and Pseudomonas spp in butter is a major cause of its deterioration (

 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Results indicate that the extension of storage time increased all bacteria count in samples. In the present study, WHE 0.5% treatment was the most effective in control Coliforms and Psychrotrophic bacteria. Increase in total psychrotrophic bacteria is more pronounced when the dairy products are produced in poor hygiene situations. The primary PTC (day 0) of samples which was between 1.08 log CFU/g, in BHT samples, to 2.24 log CFU/g in the controls was studied. After 90 days of storage, PTC reached 9.06, 7.11, 7.39 and 7.88 log/CFU, in control, WHE 0.5%, BHT and tocopherol treated samples respectively. It is evident that WHE treatment can inhibit the PTC in TB. The present outcomes could be credited to the inhibitory effect of the WHE controlling Gram-negative bacteria population. The mechanism of action of WHE is normally considered to be the derangement of the cytoplasmic membrane, active transport, electron flow and coagulation of cell ingredients. The bacteria behavior was alike (except 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>), but different percentages of bacteria growth inhibition were observed, this can be attributed mostly to the concentration of WHE and chemical composition of treatments containing compounds such as polyphenol and flavones which cause rupture of membrane (

 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> count was 1.19 log CFU/g, increasing during storage to reach final count of 8.33, 8.69, 8.77 and 8.81 log CFU/g, in the control, WHE 0.5%, WHE 0.1% and WHE 0.05% samples, respectively, which indicates that the extract does not have effect on gram-positive bacteria.
