<p id="p0165" class="p">According to yeasts/molds species recognized to be concerned in the spoilage of TB, all of the antimicrobial treatments evaluated in this study lead to significantly lower counts for yeasts/molds in WHE 0.5%, WHE 0.1%, WHE 0.05%, BHT and tocopherol TB as compared to the control groups during storage time. In
