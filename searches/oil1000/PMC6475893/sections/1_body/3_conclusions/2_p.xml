<p id="p0180" class="p">The present results indicate that the utilization of WHE as natural origin agent is safe in the 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% concentrations and has benefits for oxidative stability and inhibited the microbial growth of butter stored under suitable conditions. Butter treated with WHE 0.5% was found to be better for inhibiting the growth of bacteria and resistance against the development of peroxides than the TB incorporated with tocopherol. In addition, it was proved that WHE has a powerful antioxidant activity and inhibit the population of different gram-negative bacteria, which can lead to health problems. Antioxidant activity of samples treated with WHE 0.5% and WHE 0.05% in Schaal and AV tests, respectively was more than TB treated with tocopherol. Eventually it was found that WHE 0.05% was the most appropriate WHE concentration for sensory properties of TB.</p>
