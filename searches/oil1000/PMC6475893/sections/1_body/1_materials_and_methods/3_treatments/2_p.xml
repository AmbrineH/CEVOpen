<p id="p0035" class="p">Ripened, unsalted butter was purchased from farmers (it was manufactured according to the traditional method) for use in preliminary experiments. To make traditional butter (TB), firstly, cow milk separated to two high in fat and almost no fat phase with hand-operated centrifuges called the “milk wheel”, then yogurt starter added to high fat phase. After preparation of yogurt, it was transferred to goatskin and churning process for fat separation from buttermilk was done. The TB samples were primarily melted at 70 °C then tempered incessantly and moved into 25 °C water bath. WHE was incorporated into TB at three different concentrations; 500 (0.05%), 1000 (0.1%), and 5000 (0.5%) ppm and compared with a control (without WHE, BHT and tocopherol), BHT and tocopherol treated samples (200 mg of BHT and tocopherol/kg). Each treatment was replicated three times, kept at refrigerator temperature and studied at 0, 45 and 90 days.</p>
