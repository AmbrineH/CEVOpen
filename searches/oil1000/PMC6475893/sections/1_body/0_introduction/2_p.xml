In Iran, the traditional butter (TB) locally is obtained after milk fermentation by churning and in this way the fat content concentrates about 20 times. Since butter is kept for a lengthy time, sensory attributes can transform owing to oxidative rancidity as a result of oxygen catalyzed by lipases from microorganisms or food. At the first step of oxidation, the reaction involving unsaturated fatty acids leads to the configuration of peroxides with a resultant reduction in the safety caused by the formation of secondary toxic compounds. Oxidation eventually leads to formation of a rancid flavor and decreases the economic and nutritional value of fats (
