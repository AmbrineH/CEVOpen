 <p class="p">Incorporation of natural ingredients antioxidants in edible fats can profitably affect their oxidative stability during production and storage. The purposes of the current work were to assess the antioxidant and antimicrobial effect of walnut kernel septum membranes hydroalcohol extract (WHE) in traditional butter (TB). Antioxidant characterization of the extract was screened through methods of DPPH, reducing power and total phenolic assays. After preparation of traditional butter from yogurt, WHE was incorporated into TB at three different concentrations; 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% and compared with a control, BHT and tocopherol treated samples (200 mg of BHT and tocopherol/kg). Microbiological studies (
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, Coliforms, Psychrotrophic bacteria, yeasts and molds) were done during 90 days of storage time. Changes in Anisidine value (AV), acid value, peroxide value (PV) free fatty acids (FFA), Schaal and Totox value were monitored at 45-day intervals. Sensory evaluation was done using 10 semi-trained panelists based on the 5-point hedonic scale.

 <p class="p">It was found that the total phenolic content of WHE was 368.86 mg GAE/g. The BHT had higher antioxidant activity than WHE inhibiting 92.3% of the DPPH radical at 600 μg/mL. Peroxide value of TB treated with tocopherol, BHT and WHE 0.5% was 0.29 ± 0.07, 0.39 ± 0.07 and 0.52 ± 0.04 respectively. Furthermore, the WHE incorporated butter has shown low levels of free fatty acids, Schaal and Totox value when compared to control treatment. The WHE 0.5% incorporated sample had the most antimicrobial activity and it inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms (except 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) used in the study. Among the treated TB, the samples treated with the control and WHE 0.05% had the highest sensory attributes score. The study showed that WHE could be an excellent natural origin of antimicrobial and antioxidant agents which can be used in butter.
