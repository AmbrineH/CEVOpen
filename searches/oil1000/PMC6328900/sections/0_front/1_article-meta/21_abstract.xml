  <italic class="italic">Gallesia integrifolia</italic> (Phytolaccaceae) is native to Brazil and has a strong alliaceous odor. The objective of this study was to identify the chemical composition of 
  <italic class="italic">G. integrifolia</italic> fruit essential oil and evaluate fungicidal activity against the main food-borne diseases and food spoilage fungi. The essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation and identified by GC–MS. From 35 identified compounds, 68% belonged to the organosulfur class. The major compounds were dimethyl trisulfide (15.49%), 2,8-dithianonane (52.63%) and lenthionine (14.69%). The utilized fungi were 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus ochraceus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus versicolor</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Penicillium funiculosum</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Penicillium ochrochloron</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Penicillium verrucosum</italic> var. 
  <italic class="italic">cyclopium</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Trichoderma viride</italic>. Minimal fungicidal concentration for the essential oil varied from 0.02 to 0.18 mg/mL and bifonazole and ketoconazole controls ranged from 0.20 to 3.50 mg/mL. The lower concentration of the essential oil was able to control 
  <italic class="italic">P. ochrochloron</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">A. fumigatus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">A. versicolor</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">T. viride</italic>. This study shows a high fungicidal activity of 
  <italic class="italic">G. integrifolia</italic> fruit essential oil and can support future applications by reducing the use of synthetic fungicides.
