 <italic class="italic">G. integrifolia</italic> fruit essential oil presented fungicidal activity in much lower concentrations than bifonazole and ketoconazole controls. The fungicidal activity can be related to compounds found in the essential oil. Out of 35 identified compounds, 68% belong to the organosulfur class which, according to Kyung and Lee
