<p id="par0070" class="p">Therefore, the antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">G. integrifolia</italic> fruit essential oil is possibly due to the presence of organosulfur compounds. In addition, 29% of the fruit essential oil compounds presented disulfide links of lipophilic nature and/or heterocyclic chains. Among the major compounds, lenthionine (14.69%) presents heterocyclic chain with five sulfur atoms in its molecule, and it has already been isolated from the red algae

 <italic class="italic">Trichophyton rubrum</italic> (MIC of 3.12 μg/mL). Analyzing these results obtained for lenthionine in the reported study, we can consider that the presence of this organosulfur compound in the pau d’alho fruit essential oil influenced the antifungal activity of this study in which the obtained MIC values ranged from 10 to 90 μg/mL, representing a smaller concentration than the ones in the control (bifonazole and ketoconazole) (
