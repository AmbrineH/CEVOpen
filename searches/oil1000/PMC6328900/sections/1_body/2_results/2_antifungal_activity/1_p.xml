<p id="par0050" class="p">The fungistatic activity (MIC) for the essential oil ranged from 0.01 to 0.09 mg/mL, and positive bifonazole and ketoconazole controls varied from 0.10 to 2.50 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). MIC values for the essential oil were all lower (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) than the positive controls (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The fungicidal activity (MFC) for the essential oil varied from 0.02 to 0.18 mg/mL and bifonazole and ketoconazole controls ranged from 0.20 to 3.50 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). MFC values for the essential oil were all lower (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> ≤ 0.05) than the positive controls (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). In general, the essential oil concentration was from 1.4 to 10.0 times lower than bifonazole and from 2.8 to 175 times lower than ketoconazole, both with fungicidal effect (

 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Specifically, 
 <italic class="italic">P. ochrochloron</italic> needs a concentration of the controls bifonazole or ketoconazole 12.5 or 175 times, respectively, higher than the essential oil to obtain the same fungicidal activity. The essential oil concentration was from 22 to 25 times lower than ketoconazole control against 
 <italic class="italic">A. fumigatus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. versicolor</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. viride</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). These results make evident that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">G. integrifolia</italic> fruits have excellent performance in fungistatic and fungicidal control of several fungi.
