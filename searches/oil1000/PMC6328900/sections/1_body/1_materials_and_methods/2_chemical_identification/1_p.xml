<p id="par0030" class="p">Chemical identification of the essential oil occurred by using a gas chromatographer coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC–MS; Agilent 19091J-433). An HP-5MS UI 5% analytical column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was utilized, with an initial temperature of 60 °C, and kept for 3 min; then, a ramp of 5 °C/min and the temperature was increased to 300 °C and kept for 10 min and, finally, to 310 °C with a ramp of 10 °C/min for 10 min. Helium was utilized as the carrier gas at the linear speed of 1 mL/min until 300 °C and pressure release of 56 kPa. The injector temperature was 300 °C; the injection volume was 2 μL; the injection was in split mode (20:1). The transfer line was kept at 285 °C and the ionization source and quadrupole at 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The EM detection system was utilized in “scan” mode, in the range of mass/load ratio (
