<p class="p">The effects of ginger rhizome essential oil on total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and transaminases are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. As shown in the table, the oral administration of ginger rhizome essential oil at the doses of 100 and 150 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>l/kg bw decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) the serum content in total cholesterol with reference to the control. The serum content in LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) in all treated birds compared to the control. The serum HDL-cholesterol level increased in all treated groups compared to the control. However, this increase is significant (p&lt;0.05) only at 150 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>l/kg bw. The serum content in transaminases (AST and ALT) and creatinine decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) with ginger rhizome essential oil at all selected doses compared to that of birds in control group. When considering only quails treated with different doses of essential oil, the serum contents in ALT recorded in group of birds exposed at 100 and 150 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>l/kg bw were comparable but significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased with reference to that of birds treated at 50 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>l/kg bw. A positive and significant correlation was recorded between the serum content in ALT and the liver relative weight (
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> = +0.92; p&lt;0.05) and between the AST level and heart relative weight (
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> = +0.95; p&lt;0.05) (
