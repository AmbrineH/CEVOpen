<p class="p">Oral administration of ginger rhizomes essential oil in Japanese quails for 12 weeks induced elevation of HDL-cholesterol level. Epidemiological and clinical studies provide evidence that HDL-cholesterol levels are linked to rates of coronary events. This relationship is supported by the potential antiatherogenic properties of HDL, including its mediation of reverse cholesterol transport, in which cholesterol from peripheral tissues is returned to the liver for excretion in the bile [

Protective effect of HDL on atherosclerosis may due to its role in preventing oxidation or other adverse effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) on endothelial cell. Moreover, HDL can directly stimulate endothelial cell to produce nitric oxide and beneficial anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antithrombotic agents and promote endothelial repair processes [
