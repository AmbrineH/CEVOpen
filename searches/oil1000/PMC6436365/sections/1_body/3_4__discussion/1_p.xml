<p class="p">The phytochemical tests carried out in this study reveal that the ginger rhizomes essential oil contains various compounds including phenols, terpenes, and alkaloids. It has been demonstrated that these compounds possess fertilizing properties [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In fact, phenolic compounds in general possess various physiological properties such as antioxidant, antiallergic, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, antiviral, antibacterial, anticarcinogenic, antithrombotic, cardioprotective, and vasodilatory [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Antioxidant activity prevents the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and limiting their encrustation in the walls of the arteries [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition, an effective antioxidant system protects embryonic tissue against oxidative responsible for cell death, enhances fertility rate [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and the survival rate of animals at birth. The alkaloids have the ability to dilate the blood vessels of the sexual organs [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Terpenes have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and/or anti-inflammatory drugs [
