Apart from abdominal fat which significantly reduced in treated quails, the relative weights of the liver, the heart, the intestine, and the gizzard were not significantly affected by the essential oil of

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] reported that the use of phytobiotics did not significantly influence the relative weight of the different organs. The decrease of abdominal fat recorded in groups of quails exposed to ginger rhizome essential oil would be related to ginger hypolipidemic property. The storage of abdominal fat in animals is controlled by certain enzymes and hormones. Enzymes like lipoprotein lipase hydrolyze VLDL triglycerides and chylomicrons to allow fatty acids to be captured by the adipose cells. On the other hand, monoglyceride lipase promotes the release of fatty acids from storage triglycerides. In addition, some hormones such as insulin promote the fat accumulation. Others like glucagon or adrenaline are lipolytic [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The ginger rhizomes essential oil because of these molecules possessing hypolipidaemic properties would increase the activity of lipolytic enzymes or hormones at the expense of enzymes and hormones that favor lipogenesis.
