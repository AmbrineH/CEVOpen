<p class="p">The malondialdehyde (MDA) level decreased significantly in Japanese quails treated with ginger rhizomes essential oil. The reverse effect was noted in the antioxidative enzymes (GPx and CAT). The MDA is a major endogenous lipid peroxidation product and, therefore, the extent of lipid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be monitored by MDA levels [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] mentioned that ginger enhances antioxidant capacity of birds against ROS and reduce plasma MDA level compared to control group as the case in the present study. The ginger rhizomes essential oil riche in phenols with antioxidant activity protects animal cells against detrimental effects of ROS. This reaction would be responsible for MDA low level recorded in this work.
