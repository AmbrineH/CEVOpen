<p class="p">Egg and yolk weights increased in quails exposed to the ginger rhizome essential oil with reference to the control. These results are in agreement to those reported by Arpasova [

 <italic class="italic"> Thymus vulgaris </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> Origanum vulgare </italic>essential oil in laying Hy-Line Brown. The increase of egg weight in treated quails is related to the terpenic and phenolic compounds of
 <italic class="italic"> Z. officinale</italic> rhizomes. Terpenes due to their antimicrobial property would limit inflammatory reactions costly in energy in favor of egg production. On the other hand, phenolic compounds because of their antioxidant property would limit the alteration of cells or organs involved in the production of eggs and subsequently promote its good formation [

Based on these results, the egg yolk weight increases as the egg weight increases. The increase in egg component provides sufficient nutrients and centrally placed yolk to support embryonic growth and development [
