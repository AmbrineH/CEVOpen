<p class="p">In the present study, the serum content in AST and ALT was significantly reduced in quail exposed to
 <italic class="italic"> Z. officinale</italic> essential oil compared to those of control group. The decrease in AST and ALT levels indicates good liver status. ALT is considered as a useful quantitative marker to describe hepatocellular damage [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. This enzyme is normally found in the cytosol of hepatocytes and released into blood stream in high level in the case of liver cells membrane impairment. On the other hand, AST is mainly located in the heart and liver cells, and to a lesser extent in the cells of others muscle. Its elevated level in the blood stream is linked to heart or liver cells injury or alteration [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The improvement noted here in
 <italic class="italic"> Z. officinale</italic> essential oil-treated quails could be explained by the presence in this essential oil and the active biomolecules such as phenols and flavonoids that fight against oxidative stress and subsequently protect the heart and liver cells [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Creatinine is a waste produced by protein metabolism in the muscles of animals. It is eliminated by the kidneys and generally used as an indicator of kidney function [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Its serum level decreased significantly in treated quails compared to the control group. This could suggest a good function of nephrons. The decrease in plasma creatinine would indicate the increased ability of the kidneys to filter waste from the blood and excrete it in the urine. The phenols and flavonoids of the essential oil due to their structure capable of capturing free radicals would protect the kidneys by avoiding tubular and glomerular cell damage.
