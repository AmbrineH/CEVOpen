<p class="p">Eighty 3-week-old females Japanese quails (weight: 120-130 g) hatched at the Teaching and Research Farm of the University of Dschang were used for this experiment. Each bird was identified by a ring bearing his number in one of its paws and assigned randomly to 4 dietary treatment groups in a completely randomized design. Each group was divided into 4 replicates of 5 quails. Quails in group 1 (control) received daily by oral way distilled water (100

The animal weight was taken at the beginning and weekly to the end of the experiment for the determination of growth performance. This study was carried out at Teaching and Research Farm of the University of Dschang, Cameroon (LN 05°26′, LE 10°3′) and the entire feeding trial for all groups lasted for 9 weeks. The work considered both growing and laying phases. The growing phase lasted 9 weeks while the laying phase was performed at the last 4 consecutive weeks preceding the end of the experiment.
