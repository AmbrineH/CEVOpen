<p class="p">Blood samples of each slaughtered bird were collected from the jugular vein into tubes free of anticoagulant. After clotting, the serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the aliquots were stored at −20°C for biochemical analysis. In addition, the yolk of 12 eggs per treatment was weighted and homogenized with a cold NaCl (0.9%) to obtain a 15% homogenates (yolk weight/NaCl volume). The homogenate was subsequently centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min and the resultant supernatants were kept at −20°C for cholesterol, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) analysis.</p>
