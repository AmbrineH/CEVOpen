<p class="p">Essential oil is the concentrate and hydrophobic liquid of volatile aromatic compounds [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], such as phenolics and polyphenols, terpenoids, saponins, quinone, esters, flavone, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, and nonvolatiles residues. These molecules have many properties including antimicrobial, stimulating animal digestive system, antioxidants, antifungal, antiparasitic, and anti-inflammatory. These properties can reduce loss of energy and improved nutrients absorption for better growth and reproductive performances in animals. Among the aromatic plants containing essential oil is classified the ginger (
 <italic class="italic">Zingiber officinale)</italic>. The ginger, especially the rhizome, contains several biologically active compounds such as gingerol, shogaols, gingerdiol, and gingerdione [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. These compounds confer to ginger various activities such as antioxidants, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antiparasitic, and immunomodulatory properties [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] reported that ginger rhizomes are good source of micronutrients and pharmacological active compounds that could be useful in animal production to boost growth and reproduction performances. Zhao

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] reported laying performances enhancements, serum, and egg antioxidant status in Hy-Line Brown laying hens fed ginger powder during 10 weeks. The same author revealed that ginger powder at the levels of 10 and 15 g/kg of feed increased egg mass and improved serum and yolk antioxidant status. In addition, supplementation of broiler chickens diet with ginger increased total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH) activities but reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and cholesterol concentrations in serum of chickens at 21 and 42 days old [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Based on the diversity of active compounds found in ginger essential oil (phenols, terpenes, and alkaloids), we believe that this essential oil could positively influence growth performances and egg yolk status in birds. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of graded levels of ginger rhizome essential oil on growth and laying performances, egg yolk antioxidant and cholesterol status, and serum metabolites in Japanese quail.
