<p class="p">The liquid SMEDDS was formulated by dissolving MTX (100 mg) into 1 mL of the castor oil, Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80, and Plurol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> diisostearique mixture at a volume ratio of 27/63/10, respectively. The final mixture was vortexed to obtain a clear solution. The self-emulsification and particle size analysis were completed after examining the formulations for phase separation or signs of turbidity. Afterwards, 0.5 g of the solid carrier (calcium silicate) was well dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol by magnetic stirring; then, 1 mL of liquid SMEDDS (equivalent to 100 mg of MTX) was magnetically stirred continuously. While the solution was continuously stirring, it was spray dried with a laboratory-scale spray dryer (Buchi Mini Spray Dryer, B-290, Switzerland) under the following conditions: inlet temperature of 60 °C, outlet temperature of 40 °C, aspiration of 100% (−45 mbar), spraying air of 4 kg/cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and flow rate of 5 mL/min.
