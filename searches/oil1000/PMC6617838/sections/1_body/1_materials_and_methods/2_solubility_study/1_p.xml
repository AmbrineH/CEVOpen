<p class="p">To select appropriate components for the development of the SMEDDS formulation, solubility studies were conducted for various oils and surfactants.
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref> Excess amounts of MTX (approximately 50 mg) was transferred to 15 mL conical tube (SPL #50,015) containing 3 mL of pure oils or 10% (w/v) aqueous surfactant solutions. Then, the mixture was vortexed and kept for 7 days at 25 °C in a shaking water-bath to facilitate the solubilization. Subsequently, 1 mL of samples were centrifuged at 10,000 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min (Hanil Science Industrial Co., South Korea) to separate the undissolved MTX. The supernatant was taken and diluted with mobile phase for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis for the quantification of MTX. The concentration of MTX in the sample was quantified by the HPLC system (Agilent 1260 Infinity, Agilent Technologies, USA) consisting of the Chem Station software, G1311C 1260 Quat Pump, and G1314B 1260 VWD VL detector. The Inertsil ODS-4 column (GL Sciences, Japan, 4.6 mmI.D. x 250 mm, 5 μm) was used, and the column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 M dibasic phosphate (pH was adjusted to 3.0 with hydrochloride solution) and methanol at the volume ratio of 74/26, respectively. The mobile phase was eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The eluent was monitored by the detector at 303 nm.
