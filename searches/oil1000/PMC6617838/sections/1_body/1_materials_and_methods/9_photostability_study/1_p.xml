<p class="p">Photostability studies consisted of a forced degradation test and a confirmatory or formal test to evaluate the photostability of MTX powder and MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS. These tests were performed according to the ICH guidelines.
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref> A forced photodegradation study was carried out first. Therefore, the samples were transferred to chemically inert and transparent containers, and exposed to an artificial light source: 1.2 million lux·hr in 25 °C/60% RH for 20 days using a photostability chamber (Caron Model 6545–2, Caron, Marietta, OH, USA). A confirmatory photostability test was also performed; samples were introduced to transparent containers and placed horizontally towards the light source (indoor light) for even irradiation of the samples for 12 weeks. The drug content in the samples was quantified at predetermined time intervals by the HPLC method described above. The test was performed in triplicate for each sample. Because qualitative evaluation is just as important as the quantitative evaluation in the photostability study, the samples were visually investigated at the end of the test period for any changes in physical properties, such as appearance or color, which can imply the existence of photolytic degradation.
