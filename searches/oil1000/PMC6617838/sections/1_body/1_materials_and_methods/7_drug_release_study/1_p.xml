<p class="p">The dissolution test was performed using a USP dissolution apparatus II (paddle apparatus) (Vision Classic 6, Hanson Research Co., Los Angeles, CA, USA). Empty hard gelatin capsules were filled with either MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS or MTX powder, equivalent to 50 mg of MTX. The filled capsule was inserted into the sinker and immersed into the dissolution medium, which consisted of 900 mL of water (pH 7.2). The dissolution test was accomplished at 37±0.5 °C using 100 rpm paddle rotations. The dissolution medium-containing vessel was surrounded by an outer water-bath in order to maintain the specific temperature. At predetermined time intervals, 1 mL of dissolution medium was collected and filtered through a nylon syringe filter (0.45 μm). The concentration of MTX in the filtrate (10 μl) was measured by the HPLC method described above.</p>
