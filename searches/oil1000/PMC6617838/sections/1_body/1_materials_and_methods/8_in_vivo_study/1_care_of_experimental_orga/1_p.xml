<p class="p">Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats (280±20 g, 7–9 weeks old) were purchased from the Nara Biotech (Seoul, South Korea). Prior to the experiments, the animals were freely provided with standard laboratory food and water. During all of the procedures, the animals were housed in cages under maintained temperature (23–26 °C) and relative humidity (50–55%) environmental conditions. Food was removed approximately 12 hr before the commencement of the pharmacokinetic procedures, but the animals were allowed free access to water. All animal care and procedures were conducted according to the Guiding Principles in the Use of Animals in Toxicology, as adopted in 1989, revised in 1999, and amended in 2008 by the Society of Toxicology (SOT). The protocols for the animal studies were also approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Hanyang University.</p>
