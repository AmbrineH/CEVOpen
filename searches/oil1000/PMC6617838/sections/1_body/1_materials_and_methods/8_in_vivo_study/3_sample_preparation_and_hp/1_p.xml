<p class="p">The collected plasma samples (90 μL) were deproteinized with methanol (100 μL) in 2 mL microtubes. Afterwards, 10 μL of internal standard solution (theophylline, 1 mg/mL in methanol) were added to each tube and vortexed (1 min). Furthermore, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant organic layer was transferred to another clean microtube. Then, the resulting solution (10 μL) was analyzed by HPLC as mentioned above. All pharmacokinetic parameters, including T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (time to reach the maximum plasma concentration), C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (maximum plasma concentration), AUC (area under the whole blood concentration-time curve), K
 <sub class="sub">el</sub> (elimination rate constant), and t
 <sub class="sub">1/2</sub> (half-life), were analyzed by the WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA). Values are reported as mean ± S.D. and the data was statistically significant at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.05 between the two formulations checked by the Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test.
