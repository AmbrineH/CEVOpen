<p class="p">The droplet size of emulsions were determined by Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, UK) with the dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer at a wavelength of 635 nm and a scattering angle of 90° at 25 °C. Liquid SMEDDS (100 μL) and solid SMEDDS (160 mg) prepared as described above were introduced to 100 mL of distilled water with gentle stirring on a magnetic stirrer. Beakers were incubated to settle down the undissolved portion for 30 min at 25 °C. All studies were repeated three times, and the values of z-average diameters were used.</p>
