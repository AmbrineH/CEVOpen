<p class="p">The thermal aspects of MTX in solid SMEDDS were examined using a DSC Q20 (TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware, USA). About 5 mg of each sample were sealed in the Tzero pan and lid, and were subjected to heating at the rate of 10 °C/min from 60 to 175 °C under a nitrogen gas purge of 50 mL/min. Furthermore, the crystallinity of the samples was evaluated by PXRD (D/MAX-2500, Rigaku, Japan), which was performed at room temperature using monochromatic Cu K
