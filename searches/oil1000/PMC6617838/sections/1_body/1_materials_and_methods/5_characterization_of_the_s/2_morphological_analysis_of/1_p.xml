<p class="p">The outer morphological features of MTX powder, calcium silicate, and MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS were examined by an SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The samples were fixed on a brass sampling disc using double-sided adhesive tape. Then, they were rendered electrically conductive with the sputter coating of platinum (6 nm/min) using an EMI Teck Ion Sputter (K575K) under vacuum (8x10
