<p class="p">A pseudo-ternary phase diagram, containing oil, surfactants, and co-surfactants was constructed to identify the regions that could self-emulsify under dilution and gentle agitation. Based on the results of a solubility study, castor oil, Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80, and Plurol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> diisostearique were selected as the oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant, respectively. This formulation (0.2 mL) was introduced to 300 mL of water in a glass beaker at 37 °C, and the contents were mixed gently with a magnetic stirring bar (300 rpm). The tendency of this formulation to emulsify spontaneously and the progress of emulsion droplets were visually observed. An emulsion was judged as “good” when introduced droplets dispersed easily in water and formed a fine emulsion. Whereas, it was judged as “bad” when poor or no emulsion formation was observed with immediate coalescence or creaming of the oil droplets.
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref> Emulsions that were judged as “fine” or “poor” were further examined based on the particle size, and then given the characteristic of “good” or “bad”. All tests were performed in triplicate.
