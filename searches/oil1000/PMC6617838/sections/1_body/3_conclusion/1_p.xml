<p class="p">In this study, liquid SMEDDS was spray dried using calcium silicate as the solid carrier to produce the MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS formulation. The morphology of the solid SMEDDS formulation revealed well dispersed particles with a smooth surface. The self-emulsification ability of the solid SMEDDS was similar to that of the liquid SMEDDS, and both DSC and PXRD measurements indicated that MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS maintained its molecular dispersion state. Moreover, FTIR analysis confirmed that there were no interactions between the drug and excipients. An in vitro dissolution test revealed that the MTX release was faster and more enhanced in the solid SMEDDS than in the MTX powder. An in vivo study in rats showed that the solid SMEDDS formulation gave a significantly increased bioavailability compared to the MTX powder. Furthermore, the forced degradation and confirmatory photostability studies demonstrated that the solid SMEDDS formulation protected MTX from light-induced degradation efficiently. Thus, this solid SMEDDS formulation may provide an oral solid dosage of the water insoluble and photosensitive drug, MTX.</p>
