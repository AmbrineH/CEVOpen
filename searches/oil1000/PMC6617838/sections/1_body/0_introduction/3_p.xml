<p class="p">The purposes of the present study were to: (1) develop a novel solid self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) formulation of MTX via spray drying with calcium silicate as the solid carrier and (2) evaluate whether the solid SMEDDS improved the absorption and photosensitivity problems. Reconstitution properties of the spray dried formulation were investigated and compared to the solid state characterizations of the powder using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer. Comparative dissolution, oral bioavailability, and photostability studies were performed.</p>
