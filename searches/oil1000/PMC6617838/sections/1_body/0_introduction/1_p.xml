<p class="p">Methotrexate (MTX), previously known as amethopterin, is an antimetabolite and antifolate drug that is clinically used for the treatment of various cancers and autoimmune disorders, including breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohnâ€™s disease.
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref> MTX inhibits the metabolism of folic acid
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> and competitively inhibits the enzyme activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is related to the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins. MTX is a hydrophobic drug with low permeability, and thus, has been categorized as a class IV compound in the biopharmaceutical classification (BCS) system.
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> MTX is chemically unstable and easily degradable after exposure to light.
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref> Upon exposure to acid/alkaline pH conditions, extreme temperature, or light, MTX produces a degradation product, which makes the formulation development a challenging task.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> Accordingly, a valid protection strategy is needed to produce a robust oral dosage.
