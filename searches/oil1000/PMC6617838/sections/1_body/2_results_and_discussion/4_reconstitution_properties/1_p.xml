<p class="p">The emulsion droplet size is a very important property in SMEDDS, because it is related to the amount and rate of drug release, absorption, and stability.
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref> The emulsion droplet size was measured to determine the self-emulsification performance of the optimized formulations. The z-average diameter of the drug-loaded liquid SMEDDS (189.33±6.61 nm, PDI: 0.218±0.038) and drug-unloaded liquid SMEDDS (189.50±1.70 nm, PDI: 0.191±0.013) exhibited similar results, suggesting that drug incorporation in the SMEDDS does not have a significant influence on the self-emulsifying performance. Reconstituted microemulsion from the solid SMEDDS had the smallest z-average diameter (126.73±4.32 nm, polydispersity index (PDI): 0.226±0.006) among the tested formulations. Incorporation of liquid SMEDDS into the narrow pore of the solid carrier may have affected the decreased particle size after reconstitution. However, all of the z-average diameters of the liquid and solid SMEDDS showed an acceptable size of less than 200 nm and a low PDI of less than 0.230.
