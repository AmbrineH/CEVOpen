<p class="p"> The prepared SMEDDS formulation showed significantly enhanced aqueous solubility (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 7A</xref>) and dissolution profiles (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 7B</xref>) than those of the MTX powder. In the self-emulsifying systems, the required energy to form an emulsion is very low, thereby enabling spontaneous formations at an interface between the oil droplets and water. In the dissolution process, the oil/surfactant/co-surfactant mixture expanded effectively in water; then, the oil droplet size decreased, and eventually MTX was released at an increased rate.
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref> Dissolution studies were performed for solid SMEDDS and MTX powder, and the results of the release profiles in water are shown in 
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 7B</xref>. Within 20 min, the solid SMEDDS formulation reached the maximum percentage of released drug. The final dissolution percentage was almost 100%. However, only 53% of drug was released from the MTX powder at 60 min. These results verify that the solid SMEDDS enhanced the dissolution of MTX.
