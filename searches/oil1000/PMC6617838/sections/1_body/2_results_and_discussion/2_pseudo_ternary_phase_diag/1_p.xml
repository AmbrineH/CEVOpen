<p class="p"> A series of SMEDDS combinations were prepared, and their self-emulsification properties were observed visually. First, a pseudo-ternary phase diagram was constructed in the absence of MTX to identify optimized concentrations of the oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant. The phase diagram of the system containing castor oil, Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80, and Plurol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> diisostearique is shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>. As seen from the pseudo-ternary phase diagram, these combinations produced a reasonably wide self-emulsification region. Fine spontaneous emulsions did not efficiently form when the concentration of the surfactant was less than oil. The efficiency of emulsification was good when the composition of surfactant/co-surfactant was more than 55% v/v of the SMEDDS formulation. The formulations surrounding the self-emulsification region demonstrated poor emulsion forming ability. It has been reported that the drug incorporated into the SMEDDS may influence the self-emulsifying performance.
