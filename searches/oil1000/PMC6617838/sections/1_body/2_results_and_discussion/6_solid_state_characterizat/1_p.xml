<p class="p">DSC is the most widely utilized thermal analysis method to monitor endothermic processes (ie, melting, phase transition, and chemical degradation) as well as exothermic processes. Also, DSC can indicate the existence of drug/carrier interactions. The thermal behavior of the MTX powder, calcium silicate, physical mixture, and solid SMEDDS are shown in 
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. The DSC curves showed that MTX had a distinct endothermic peak around 155 °C, indicating its exact melting point and confirming its crystalline nature (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, a small endothermic peak corresponding to the drug was observed in the physical mixture (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4C</xref>), which was mixed with 100 mg of MTX and 500 mg of calcium silicate using pestle and mortar. On the contrary, calcium silicate (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>) and solid SMEDDS (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4D</xref>) had no intrinsic peak of the drug, indicating that the drug must exist in a molecularly dissolved state in the solid SMEDDS.
