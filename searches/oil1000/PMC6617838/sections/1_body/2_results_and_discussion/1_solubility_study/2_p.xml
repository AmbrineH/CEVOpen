<p class="p">Among the different tested oils (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1A</xref>), castor oil gave the maximum drug solubility (74.40±3.38 μg/mL), and was therefore chosen as the oil for further studies. Among the tested surfactants (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1B</xref>), Plurol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> diisostearique (triglycerol diisostearate), Span 80 (sorbitan monooleate), and Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80 (polysorbate 80) showed higher drug solubility than the other tested surfactants. In several trial combinations of different surfactants and co-surfactants, the mixture of Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80 (hydrophile-lipophile balance [HLB] 15) and Plurol diisostearique (HLB 4.5) demonstrated excellent viscosity and HLB values.
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref> Thus, Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80 and Plurol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> diisostearique were chosen as the surfactant and co-surfactant, respectively. Although Span 80 (HLB 4.3) showed better solubility than Plurol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> diisostearique, it demonstrated high viscosity when mixed with Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80.
