<p class="p"> FTIR spectroscopic results are shown in 
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. MTX produced major distinguishing bands at 3,450 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (O-H stretching from carboxyl groups), 1,670–1,600 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (C=O stretching from carboxylic group and amidic group, so the band split into a doublet), 1495 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (N-H bending from amide group), 1,400–1,200 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (C-O stretching from carboxylic group), and 832 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (C-H - two adjacent hydrogens on aromatic ring, 
 <italic class="italic">para</italic> substitution) (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6A</xref>). These specific bands, such as 3,450, 1,670–1,600, 1,495, 1,400–1,200, and 832 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> also appeared in the FTIR patterns of the physical mixture (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6C</xref>) and of the solid SMEDDS (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6D</xref>). There was no apparent shift of bands or an emergence of new bands, confirming the absence of changes in the chemical bond formation between the drug and excipients.
