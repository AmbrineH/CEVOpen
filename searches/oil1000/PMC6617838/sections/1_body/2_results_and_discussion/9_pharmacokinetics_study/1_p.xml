<p class="p">The mean plasma concentration-time profiles of MTX powder and MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS, equivalent to a 20 mg/kg MTX dose, are represented in 
 <xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>. Solid SMEDDS showed a significantly higher plasma concentration of MTX than MTX powder for first 4 hr after oral administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The AUC and C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of solid SMEDDS were significantly higher as compared to those of the MTX powder. In particular, the AUC values of MTX powder and solid SMEDDS were 1738.71±294.65 and 3542.69±670.73 hr·ng/mL, respectively, whereas the C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> values were 265.63±57.05 and 904.99±256.47 ng/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>), t half-life (t
 <sub class="sub">1/2</sub>), and elimination rate constant (K
 <sub class="sub">el</sub>) were not significantly different. These results suggest that MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS improved the bioavailability of MTX.
