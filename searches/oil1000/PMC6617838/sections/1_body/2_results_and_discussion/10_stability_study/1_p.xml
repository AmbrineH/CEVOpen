<p class="p"> The preservation and robustness of a product against degradation by light is an important property for developing new formulations.
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref> Time-dependent changes in the MTX content under light irradiation was monitored to evaluate whether solid SMEDDS formulation protected MTX from photodegradation. The photostability of MTX was tested by a forced degradation method and confirmatory analysis. In order to evaluate the overall photosensitivity of the formulation, a forced photodegradation study was performed for 20 days. It was conducted by exposing an excess amount of artificial light using a photostability chamber until significant degradation had occurred. At the same time, the photostability of MTX powder and MTX-loaded solid SMEDDS was tested by exposing the respective formulations to daylight for 12 weeks in the confirmatory analysis. Data obtained after the forced photodegradation and confirmatory test are represented in
