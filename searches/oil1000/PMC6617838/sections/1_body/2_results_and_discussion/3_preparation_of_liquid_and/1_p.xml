<p class="p">In the SMEDDS systems, visual observation is the primary method for judging self-emulsification. The efficiency of self-emulsification can be evaluated by measuring the rate of emulsification and the droplet size. The emulsion droplet size is an important factor in self-emulsification performance, because it is highly correlated with the amount and rate of drug release, as well as drug absorption.
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref> The z-average emulsion diameters of various surfactant/oil ratios are shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>. Of the tested formulations, a surfactant/oil ratio of 70/30 (v/v), respectively, showed the most effective emulsion size. When the oil ratio was less than 15%, a smaller diameter micelle was observed instead of an emulsion.
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref> The effect of the co-surfactant concentration on the emulsion size in SMEDDS was observed (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 2C</xref>). A co-surfactant ratio of 10% showed the smallest emulsion size, and a rapid increase in emulsion size was observed at co-surfactant ratios of more than 15%. Finally, the liquid SMEDDS formulation, which was composed of 27% castor oil, 63% Tween
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 80, and 10% Plurol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> diisostearique, gave the smallest z-average diameter of all tested formulations. Furthermore, 10% (w/v) drug was entirely dissolved in this formulation, suggesting that it should be used for further studies.
