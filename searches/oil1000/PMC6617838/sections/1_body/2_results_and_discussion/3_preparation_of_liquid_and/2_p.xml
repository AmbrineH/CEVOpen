<p class="p">Subsequently, the ethanolic solution (200 mL) containing 0.5 g of calcium silicate (CaSiO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) and 1 mL of liquid SMEDDS was spray dried to transform liquid SMEDDS into solid SMEDDS. Many kinds of solid carriers, such as silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, and dextran, can be used for the same purpose. However, in a preliminary study testing these solid carriers, calcium silicate was the most effective material. Calcium silicate is capable of absorbing a very large amount of oil (4–6 mL/g) through its numerous pores, and thus, has been commonly used for the solidification of oily formulations.
