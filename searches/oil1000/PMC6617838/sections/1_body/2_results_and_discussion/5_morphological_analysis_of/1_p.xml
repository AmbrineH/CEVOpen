<p class="p">Scanning electron micrographs of the MTX powder, solid carrier (calcium silicate), and solid SMEDDS are shown in 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. This analysis revealed that MTX powder (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref>) had an even surfaced and angulated crystals in shape. On the other hand, calcium silicate was uneven and highly porous surface (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>), which probably allowed the influx of the aqueous phase into the substance. Furthermore, solid SMEDDS (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 3C</xref>) had a relatively smooth surface of calcium silicate particles, suggesting that liquid SMEDDS is absorbed or coated inside the pores of calcium silicate.
