<p class="p">The GC analyses were carried out on an Agilent Technologies 7,890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a single injector and a flame ionization detector (FID). An apolar HP‐5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness) coated with 5% phenyl and 95% methyl polysiloxane was used. The carrier gas was nitrogen with the flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The initial column temperature was 60°C; it was programmed to increase at 4°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 280°C. The injector temperature was set at 280 and 300°C. Split injection was conducted with a ratio split of 1:40. Essential oil samples of 0.1 μl were injected neatly. GC‐MS analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies 7,890 gas chromatograph coupled to the Agilent 5,975°C mass selective detector (MSD) and the quadrupole EI mass analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). An HP‐5MS 5% column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used as the stationary phase. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 0.8 ml/min flow rate. The temperature was programmed from 60°C to 280°C at the 4°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> ramp rate. The injector and the GC‐MS interface temperatures were maintained at 290°C and 300°C, respectively. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV, and the mass range was from 
 <italic class="italic">m/z</italic> 50 to 550 amu. The components were identified based on the comparison of their mass spectra with those of NIST08 (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Willey (ChemStation data system) libraries, as well as by comparison with the calculation of their retention indices, as reported in the literature (Adams,
