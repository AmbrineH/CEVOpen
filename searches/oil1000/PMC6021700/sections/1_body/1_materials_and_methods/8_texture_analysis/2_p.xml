<p class="p">Breaking force of the samples was measured by the puncture test, using a texture analyzer (CT3, Brookfield engineering, USA). One chip of potato for each treatment (control, fried by enriched oil with each of TBHQ, BHA, 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> essential oil, or 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> essential oil) was placed on the sample holder and punctured with a stainless probe (No. 44) at the ambient temperature. At least ten samples were developed in each assay; and in each test, the breaking force was measured.
