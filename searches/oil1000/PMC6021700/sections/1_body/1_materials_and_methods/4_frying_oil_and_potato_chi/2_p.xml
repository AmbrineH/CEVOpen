<p class="p">Frying sunflower oil without any antioxidant was obtained from Nahangol Co. (Nahangol, Boroujen, Iran), and the profile of the fatty acids of sunflower was developed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC‐FID), as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Three most abundant fatty acids in sunflower oil used in this study were in the order: linoleic acid (58.63%), oleic acid (27.96%), and palmitic acid (7.62%). Pretests had been performed by different concentrations of essential oils, but 3,000 ppm showed the best antioxidant activity which could be compared to 200 ppm synthetic antioxidants. Sunflower oil had been selected due to its extensive use. The essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> were added in the concentration of 3,000 parts per million (ppm), and synthetic antioxidants BHA and TBHQ, each with levels of 200 ppm, were added to the sunflower oil (without any antioxidant) in a dark‐colored glass. Also, an oil sample without any additives was prepared as the control group. These samples were used to determine the antioxidant effects of essential oils on the potato chips properties. Agria potatoes were prepared from Zarin Tapesh Khavaran Co. (Boroujen, Iran). Potatoes were washed, peeled, and sliced (1.3 mm thickness) using a sterile stainless steel slicer. Slices were rinsed immediately after cutting in distilled water until the frying process. Potato slices were transferred to the fryer (ADR2, Moulinex, France) containing hot sunflower oil; they were fried for 13 ± 2 min. Frying temperature was kept almost constant (±1°C). All samples were packed in aluminum bags and stored in an electric oven at 60 ± 1°C for a storage period of 60 days to investigate their physicochemical properties.
