<p class="p">The oxidation stability of oil samples was studied in the experimental conditions. The impact of the antioxidative properties on the stability of sunflower oil was compared to that of the control (without any antioxidant) to determine oxidation induction time (hr), as measured by the Rancimat apparatus (Metrohm 743, Switzerland). About 3 ml of each sample was placed in the heating block device. The temperature was set at 120°C. The electrodes were placed in 60 ml of distilled water, and the airflow was set at 20 L/hr. The air supply was connected to the tubes containing the oil samples, and the chart recorder was started. Over time, the volatile oxidation products were trapped in distilled water and determined conductometrically. The induction time was defined as the necessary time to reach the inflection point of the conductivity curve (Halbault, Barbé, Aroztegui, &amp; De La Torre,
