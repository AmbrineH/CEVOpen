<p class="p">The main aim of this study was to enrich the frying oil with 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> leaf and 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> aerial parts essential oils to produce a harmless potato chips product. Findings of the present investigation demonstrated that potatoes fried in the oil without any additives (control) had the lowest quality and storage stability; it was increased by the addition of antioxidants to BHA, TBHQ, 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis,</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> essential oils. As described, essential oils could prevent oxidation and undesirable changes, with no effect on the sensory properties.
