<p class="p">The main purpose of using an antioxidant, both natural and synthetic, as an additive in the food industry is to maintain quality and prolong the shelf‐life of the foodstuffs by protecting them against the deterioration caused by oxidation (Wanasundara &amp; Shahidi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). A variety of natural and synthetic antioxidants are used in fat‐containing foods in the industry; the majority of these are synthetically manufactured. By focusing on the safety issue of these ingredients, a large body of research has identified unwanted problems of these synthetic antioxidants for humans, such as carcinogenic effects (Race, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Some of the most frequently synthetic groups of antioxidants used as food additives include tertiary‐butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT; E319‐E321) group. This group is used in a variety of products, but it is most commonly found in foods that contain oil and fat (Wanasundara &amp; Shahidi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). BHA and BHT have been used in food products with some restrictions since the late 1950s; also, in Europe, TBHQ became an accepted antioxidant for food use in 2004. These prohibitions result from unsafe effects reported by some studies (Race,

 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Consequently, there is an increasing tendency to use naturally occurring antioxidants in food products, in order to replace the more conventional synthetic antioxidants (Wanasundara &amp; Shahidi,
