In a study conducted by Che Man and Tan, the effects of oleoresin rosemary or sage extract, by antioxidant activity, on palm olein during deep‐fat frying of potato chips were evaluated. The sensory evaluation of fried potato chips showed that there was no significant difference in terms of flavor, odor, and texture (Che Man &amp; Tan,
