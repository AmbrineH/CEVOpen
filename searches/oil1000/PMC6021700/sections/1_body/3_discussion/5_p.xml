<p class="p">According to Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, the samples containing 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> had the highest slope of PV, while TBHQ had the lowest slope. The samples containing natural antioxidants 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> had a lower slope than BHA. Our findings were in agreement with the results of Rababah et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), who found the PV values of the potato chips enriched with grape seed extracts or green tea extracts, which contained a large amount of antioxidant compounds, were lower than those of the control during 90 days of storage. A study showed that the addition of 
 <italic class="italic">Bunium persicum</italic> essential oil to the crude soybean oil could decrease the PV of oil in the accelerated condition at 60°C by antioxidant activity; consequently, it was able to reduce the oxidation rate (Shahsavari, Barzegar, Sahari, &amp; Naghdibadi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). From these findings, it could be assumed that the improvement of stability against oxidation is due to the presence of some components in the essential oils, such that the antioxidant activity of thymol, carvacrol, α‐pinene, and linalool could be observed.
