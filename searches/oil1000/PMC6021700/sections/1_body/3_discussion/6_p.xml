<p class="p">Designed for the measurement of the secondary products of oxidation, the TBA test is now one of the most commonly used methods to measure the oxidative deterioration of fat‐containing foods (Kishida et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). The test is based on the color product resulting from the reaction of TBA with malondialdehyde (MDA); it is generated in the oxidized lipids, which is measured spectrophotometrically at its absorption maximum at 530–535 nm (Antolovich et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn3597-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, these results were in agreement with the findings of Allam and El‐Sayed (Allam &amp; El‐Sayed, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In their study, potato chips were prepared using olein oil enriched by TBHQ, vitamin A (retinyl palmitate), vitamin E (tocopherol), or ascorbyl palmitate (vitamin C); the results showed that TBA values of potato chips fried using vitamin C or A were lower than those of control (Allam &amp; El‐Sayed, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In thyme‐treaded nuggets, the antioxidant effect of essential oil resulted in the improvement of the oxidative stability and the reduction in TBA value within the 6 months of storage (Ganjali Dashti, Mirlohi, Ganjali Dashti, Jafari, &amp; Bahreini Esfahani,
