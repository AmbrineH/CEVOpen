 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), who found that natural antioxidants grape seed extract and green tea extract (either at the 1000 ppm level) were effective in preventing the rancidity development during 60 days of storage. A study showed that a mixture of 400 ppm methanolic extract and mango seed kernel oil increased the oxidative stability of sunflower oil, both at the ambient and frying temperatures, as well as the quality characteristic of potato chips. This effect was due to the phenolic compounds of mango seed kernel oil, which had antioxidant activities on sunflower oil and potato chips (Abdalla, Darwish, Ayad, &amp; El‐Hamahmy,
