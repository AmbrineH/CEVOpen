<p class="p">Twenty‐six components, accounting for 96.98% of the total composition, were identified for the 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> essential oil (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The composition of the 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> essential oil predominantly included α‐pinene (41.55%) and 1,8‐cineole (32.24%), linalool (7.13%), and α‐terpineol (4.74%), as identified by the major components. According to the chromatogram, 16 compounds representing 91.15% of 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> essential oil were isolated. According to Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>, linalool (54.02%) and carvacrol (19.93%) as the main constituents accounted for 73.95% of the total compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic>. Our findings were comparable to the results obtained by Ghasemi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0501" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>); in their study, α‐pinene (31.8%), 1,8 cineole (24.6%), limonene (14.8%), linalool (8.3%), and α‐terpineol (4.8%) were the main components of the 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> essential oil (19). Other studies have determined carvacrol, p‐cymene, γ‐terpinene, and thymol as the major constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> (Nejad Ebrahimi, Hadian, Mirjalili, Sonboli, &amp; Yousefzadi, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Safaei‐Ghomi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The main cause of these variations in the chemical composition of essential oils could be related to the origin, the environmental conditions, the developmental stage of collected plant materials, and the extraction method.
