<p class="p">The results of Rancimat test showed that the control sample without any antioxidants had the lowest induction period (11.91 hr); this was followed by 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> (12.72 hr), 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> (12.12 hr), and BHA (13.06 hr). The greatest shelf‐life was found in the TBHQ group (38.42 hr). As a result, the addition of each of 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">M. comminnus</italic> essential oils, as well the synthetic antioxidants (BHA and TBHQ), could increase the shelf‐life of sunflower oil significantly (
