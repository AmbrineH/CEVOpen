<p class="p">Lipid oxidation involves the continuous formation of primary oxidation products; hydroperoxides that are unstable may be decomposed, yielding secondary products (Dobarganes &amp; Velasco,

In this method, a saturated solution of potassium iodide is added to oil samples to react with hydroperoxides. The liberated iodine (I
