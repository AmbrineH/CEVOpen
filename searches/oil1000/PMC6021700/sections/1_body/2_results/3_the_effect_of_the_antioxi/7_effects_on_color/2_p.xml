<p class="p">Color of potato chips is a particularly important characteristic for the potato processing industry, and it is stringently related to consumer acceptance (Scanlon, Roller, Mazza, &amp; Pritchard, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Color of fried potatoes has been usually measured in units L*a*b*. L* is the luminance or lightness component, which ranges from 0 to 100 (Papadakis, Abdul‐Malek, Kamdem, &amp; Yam, 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). The comparison of L* values indicated that samples containing BHA or TBHQ had a significantly whiter color (higher L* value), as compared to control (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05); in the samples containing 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus,</italic> essential oils improved the lightness of potato chips, showing no significant difference with the control (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Indeed, the lightness value (L*) was 54.65 for the control chips, whereas 57.39 and 55.96 were found for potato chips fried by the enriched sunflower oil in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> essential oil, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn3597-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). It may be inferred that the volatility of essential oils led to the evaporation of heated oil in the earlier stages of frying. Unlike L*, BI did not follow a defined rule, indicating the reason for the lower dark color in synthetic antioxidants; in addition, the dark color was effective in the BI increase.
