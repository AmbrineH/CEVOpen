 <italic class="italic"> T. carmanicus</italic> essential oils, and BHA or TBHQ synthetic antioxidants significantly reduced AV in potato chips. Sunflower oil without any additive (control) produced severe acidity during potato frying; however, the addition of antioxidants, either synthetic (TBHQ and BHA) or natural (
