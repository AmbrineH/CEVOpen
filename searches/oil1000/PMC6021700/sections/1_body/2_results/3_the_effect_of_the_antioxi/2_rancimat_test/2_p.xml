<p class="p">Foodstuffs that contained oil like potato chips turned rancid over time. This was caused by chemical changes in the fat; in particular, its oxidation was noteworthy. Because of this, determining the oxidation stability of fats and oils in foods has proven to be a useful tool in the quality control of foodstuffs. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by measuring the length of the induction time, as determined by Rancimat test. Rancimat is a rapid automated method that provides reliable information about the oxidation stability of fats and oils (de la Presa‐Owens, Lopez‐Sabater, &amp; Rivero‐Urgell,
