 <p class="p">The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant effects of the essential oils of 
  <italic class="italic">Myrtus communis</italic> leaves and 
  <italic class="italic">Thymus caramanicus</italic> aerial parts in order to improve the physicochemical properties of potato chips. Sunflower oil without any antioxidant (control group) was fortified with 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">BHA</styled-content> or 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">TBHQ</styled-content> antioxidants (200 ppm), and 
  <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> or 
  <italic class="italic">T. caramanicus</italic> essential oils (3,000 ppm). The effects of the antioxidant behavior of these compounds on the physicochemical properties of potato chips were analyzed by measuring peroxide value (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PV</styled-content>), acid value (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">AV</styled-content>), and thiobarbituric acid (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">TBA</styled-content>). In addition, changes occurring in oxidation stability, texture, and color were evaluated. The results revealed that samples containing either 
  <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> or 
  <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> showed a significant decrease in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PV</styled-content>, as compared to the control sample. Compared with the control, the extracted oil of potato chips with 
  <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> or 
  <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> led to the significant reduction in 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">AV</styled-content> (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05). The results also revealed the addition of the essential oils of 
  <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> or 
  <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> was obviously effective in preventing the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">TBA</styled-content> increasing value. Based on the results obtained by the Rancimat test, either 
  <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> or 
  <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> essential oils could significantly increase the shelf‐life of potato chips, as compared with the control sample (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05). The hardness of potato chips was decreased in 
  <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> or 
  <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> groups (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05), as compared to the control sample. Neither 
  <italic class="italic">M. communis</italic> nor 
  <italic class="italic">T. carmanicus</italic> essential oils had any negative effects on the lightness values, as compared to the control (
  <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .05). Based on the results, the physicochemical properties of potato chips could be improved with the addition of these essential oils.
