<p class="p">Now, this highly ambiguous traditional nomenclature hits a global market, where Tulsi is praised as an “adaptogen” for the stressed Westerner [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] and traded in continuously increasing amounts. This conflict of nomenclature will inevitably culminate in serious problems for quality control and consumer information. The situation is complicated further by the fact that several chemovars exist that strongly differ in their composition of essential oils–for instance, commercial use discriminates between a methyl-cinnamate, a camphor, and a citral chemotype of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic>, while for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> four different chemotypes are described [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, it is not clear, to what extent these chemical differences are determined by genetics (“nature”), and to what extent by differences in the environment (“nurture”).
