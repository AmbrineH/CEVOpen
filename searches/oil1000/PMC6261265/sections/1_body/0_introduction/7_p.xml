<p class="p">A model case for the conflict of vernacular and scientific nomenclature is represented by the Basils (genus 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic>). From molecular phylogeny, the origin of the genus can be inferred to be tropical Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] with the centre of diversity in the Indian subcontinent. The Basils are probably the medicinal plants with the longest documented tradition spanning around four millennia with first records dating to the Vedic scripts. As might be expected from such a long and intricate history of human use, the traditional nomenclature of the Basils (Tulsi, Tulasi) is complex, ambiguous, and, in the last consequence, not projectable on to any scientific taxonomy. On the other hand, the trading volume is, with around 100 t of essential oils per year, quite considerable [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Depending on their appearance and use, the Tulsis are differentiated in a kind of binomial nomenclature–for instance, the dominant form, called Rama Tulsi, is used for religious purposes and usually “translated” as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The purple Krishna Tulsi, named after its resemblance to the colour of the Hindu deity Krishna, is preferred for medical use and also assigned to 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In contrast, Rama Tulsi (synonymous with Sri Tulsi), probably due to its importance for worship, is sometimes assigned to (the now outdated) 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sanctum L</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. A third type, Vana Tulsi (the meaning “forest” Tulsi may indicate that it is often collected in the wild), is mostly “translated” as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] although it is also used as a name for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">canum</italic> (an outdated name for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic> L., [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). There is a whole cosmos of additional types of Tulsi that partially stand for other species of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic>, such as Babui Tulsi for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] that can also appear as Kali Tulsi [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], while Kala Tulsi stands for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic>, but in the same source [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] is also used as a synonym for Sri Tulsi, while Ram Tulsi is also used for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic> L. Only a few species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">kilimandscharicum</italic>, which was brought to India from East Africa, seem to carry a traditional name (Kapur Tulsi from the Hindi word for camphor) that is unequivocal. The 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> type of Tulsi might even show further differentiations, because for certain treatments, such as the expelling of worms or wound healing, a form of Tulsi is prescribed that is called Surasaadi [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>].
