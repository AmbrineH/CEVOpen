<p class="p">It is evident that problems caused by the ambiguities of vernacular taxonomy will be accentuated progressively as a consequence of economic globalisation. Already in the 1990s, the international trade volume for pharmaceutical plants was estimated to exceed 400 000 tons per year [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], a number which will have increased in the years since and does not consider the extensive proportion of medicinal plants that are directly consumed in their country of origin. Consumer safety is further deteriorated by deliberate replacement of medicinal plants by cheaper, but often inactive, substitutes–a problem that in combination with a rapidly growing internet trade, has become a major concern for a substantial proportion of commercially traded medicinal plants [

This metaphor for a translation device illustrates the problem: there is no bidirectional relation in the “translation” of vernacular into scientific nomenclature, since the vernacular nomenclature is context dependent.
