<p class="p">Three examples may suffice to illustrate this point: The traditional Mesoamerican oil crop ‘Chia’ is currently booming as so called “super food” in Europe and is defined as 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia hispanica</italic> L. by the EU Novel Food Regulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, in their region of origin, the name ‘Chia’ (in the languages of the native Mesoamericans meaning just “oily”) is used for six different plants; some of them, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Amaranthus caudatus</italic>, belong to completely different plant families [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Ambiguities of vernacular names can also lead to drastic misdeclaration of commercial products as found recently for Bamboo tea (designated as 
 <italic class="italic">Dan Zhu Ye</italic> in Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM). Many samples did not contain any Bamboo, but rather the leaves of a Chinese species of carnation, which in China is also known as “Stone Bamboo” (
 <italic class="italic">Shi Zhu</italic>) and should not be consumed by pregnant women because it activates uterine contractions [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. So far, the most serious consequence of misunderstood vernacular taxonomy is the case of 
 <italic class="italic">han fangchi</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">Aristolochia fangchi</italic>) which had been traded to Europe as (guan) fangchi (
 <italic class="italic">Stephania tetrandra</italic>), with the consequence that more than 100 women in Belgium lost their kidneys as a result of consuming a TCM based slimming therapy [
