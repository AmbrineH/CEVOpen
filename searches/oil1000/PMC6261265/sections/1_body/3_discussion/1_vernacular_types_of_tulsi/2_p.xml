<p class="p">Vernacular nomenclature is based on differences in human use of the respective plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], whereas scientific taxonomy strives to create a nomenclature that reflects “natural” relationships among plants. While the classical Linnean concept of species as morphologically distinct groups of individuals has been mostly replaced by concepts in which genetic relationship and gene flow are used to define a species, the debate about what species actually are and how we can delineate them is ongoing (for a comprehensive discussion of current species concepts see [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]). In the context of “biological species” that are defined by genetic barriers, hybridisation of species, i.e. the successful breakage of these barriers, must represent the exception to the rule. However, it becomes increasingly clear that hybridisation is a powerful driving force for speciation reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. This is particularly relevant for plants, where genetic barriers are much more permeable than in animals. The Lamiaceae, with an estimate of some 7000 species, have so far remained recalcitrant to a consistent taxonomy—Lindley’s 
 <italic class="italic">bonmot</italic> of the “
 <italic class="italic">state of confusion</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">that has been gradually increasing since the days of Linnaeus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">until it has become the disgrace of Botany</italic>” [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] has basically remained valid. One reason may be the fact that species barriers are maintained here mainly by differences in flower morphology that provide a certain (but by no means a secure) channelling of gene flow. A classic example is the role of the pollination lever in the sympatric speciation of Central European 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Changes in the geometry of sexual organs leading to hybridisation are a likely event and are expected to generate a more or less reticulate field of different “species”. In this context, the diffuse clustering of four 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> species into haplotype I is what would be expected, while the fairly robust delineation of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> into a separate haplotype is a phenomenon that demands further explanation.
