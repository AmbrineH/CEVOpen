<p class="p">In the current work, we can show that plastidic barcoding markers can identify different haplotypes within the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic>: Haplotype II (
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic>) clearly differs from haplotype I (
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">x africanum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">kilimandscharicum</italic>). Rama Tulsi and Krishna Tulsi belong to the 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> haplotype, while the third type, Vana Tulsi, belongs to haplotype I, although it cannot be assigned to any of the four recognised species in this cluster. This genetic difference is mirrored by differences in the profiles of secondary compounds. Developmental state and light quality can modulate the amplitude to which the chemical profile becomes manifest, possibly linked with different, light-quality dependent responses in the development of oil glands. Nevertheless, the profile itself seems to be relatively hard-wired, as seen by the robust difference between Vana Tulsi and the other two (Rama, Krishna) types of Tulsi. Our findings are consistent with a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], where ‘Ram Tulsi’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’ diverged clearly from 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">citriodorum</italic> (a synonym of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">x africanum</italic>), and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">kilimandscharicum</italic>, although this conclusion was based on only one sequence per accession.
