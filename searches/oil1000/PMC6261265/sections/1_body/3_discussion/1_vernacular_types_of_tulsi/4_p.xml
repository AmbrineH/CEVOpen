 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic>, has a much smaller genome which seems to derive from a hypopolyploid event, where the basal number of chromosomes had been reduced to 9. This would provide a straightforward explanation for the very tight genetic divergence of haplotype II (
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic>), in contrast to the rather promiscuous pattern seen between the species forming haplotype I. ‘Vana Tulsi’, while clearly clustering with haplotype I, nevertheless differs from any of the tested species in this cluster and from its morphology rather resembles the accessions of haplotypes II and III, indicative of a certain degree of reproductive isolation–it might therefore be promising to investigate this type of Tulsi by cytogenetics to search for marks of incipient speciation, for instance in consequence of a hybridisation event. It is recognised that the plastidic markers used in the current study are not suited to detect hybridisations. Nuclear barcoding markers such as the internally transcribed sequences ITS1 and ITS2 might allow further resolution. Results from our previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] indicate that these markers allow further differentiation within haplotype I, and we are currently including additional accessions to obtain more solid data in support of this hypothesis.
