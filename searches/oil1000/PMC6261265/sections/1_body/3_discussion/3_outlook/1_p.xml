<p class="p">Making use of sequence differences in the barcoding marker 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA</italic>, we were able to discriminate different types of the medicinal plant Tulsi and to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of Vana Tulsi (haplotype I) versus Rama and Krishna Tulsi (haplotype II). Further, we developed a simple and rapid assay to discriminate these types of Tulsi based on a differential restriction site in this marker. Although this assay can contribute to improved transparency, because it highlights differences which align to vernacular designations of commercial products, further progress in discriminative resolution would be desirable. Given the impact of genome remodelling during the evolution of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], duplications in gene families would be one of the optionsâ€“a principle exploited in Tubulin-Based Polymorphism, a strategy with high resolutive power [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. For instance, the practice to commercialise Tulsi in complex mixtures with other Ayurvedic plants clearly illustrates the limitation even of 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA</italic> as trait-independent marker. For practical applications, it is the chemical specificities that matter. Our observation that the compound profiles seem to be based on genetic differences, while environmental conditions (light quality) and development instead modulate the degree to which these profiles become manifest, provides a good starting point to develop trait-related markers that would discriminate specific chemotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic>. This would also allow authentication of target species in a mixed sample without the need for demanding approaches such as high-throughput genomics of commercial samples.
