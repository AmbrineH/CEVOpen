<p class="p">Despite the prospects for industrial applications, there is still a long way to go until molecular markers can be used routinelyâ€“the regulatory and technical issues have been comprehensively reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. For instance, many of the traded products contain mixtures of different plant species, parallel processing of a large number of samples by PCR poses the challenge that even minute contamination can be amplified creating false positive results and DNA quality in what are often processed samples may become limiting. A further drawback of authentication by barcoding is the need to generate and analyse the sequences before a conclusion on the identity of the sample can be made. This is time consuming and requires expertise in handling sequence information, which conflicts with the requirements of practical use, where large number of samples may have to be checked in a short time to decide whether they can be released for trading. Fingerprinting methods, such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (using arbitrary primer pairs to generate a banding pattern) are convenient at first sight, because they do not require any working hypothesis. However, the reliability of these markers for authentication is limited as shown by systematic validation testing in the Brassicaceae [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The reason is mainly that the relatively low annealing temperatures for these arbitrary primers can generate non-specific amplification products. Also, bands of equal size do not necessarily originate from the same template but are treated as if they were. Alternative markers, such as inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), allow for a better resolution as compared to the plastidic barcodes [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. However, for the same reasons as for RAPD (low annealing temperatures, ambiguous assignment of banding patterns), the ISSR approach can have reproducibility issues [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], which may be tolerable in a taxonomic study, but strongly conflicts with the needs of consumer protection.
