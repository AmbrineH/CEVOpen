<p class="p">Assays to authenticate commercial samples must meet three central requirements: they have to be fast, they have to be easy, and they have to be reliable. Our approach, targeting a restriction polymorphism of the 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA</italic> marker, meets these requirements. We exemplarily applied this strategy to two commercial samples declared to contain mixtures of ‘Rama’, ‘Krishna’, and ‘Vana Tulsi’, (which was declared as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic>) and could show that the declaration of ‘Vana Tulsi’ as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic> was wrong.
