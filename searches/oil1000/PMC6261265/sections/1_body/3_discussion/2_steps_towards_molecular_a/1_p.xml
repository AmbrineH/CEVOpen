<p class="p">In the current work, we have explored the potential of barcodes for authentication of ambiguous plant material for the sake of consumer safety and product transparency. For commercial application, discriminative power is not sufficient as criterion. Robust amplification success or accessibility for sequencing are further criteria that must be met. In our hands, two of the markers, 
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA</italic>, show the best potential for commercial application. While 
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic> was the marker which was most easily amplified (for instance, if compared to 
 <italic class="italic">matK</italic>), its relatively high degree of conservation represents a certain drawback. Therefore, the 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA</italic> barcode seems to provide a good compromise between robust amplification and discriminative power. This is consistent with the experience of others, and in fact, the introduction of this marker into the British Pharmacopoeia to authenticate 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> represents the first example of a DNA barcode as a trait in industrial quality assurance [
