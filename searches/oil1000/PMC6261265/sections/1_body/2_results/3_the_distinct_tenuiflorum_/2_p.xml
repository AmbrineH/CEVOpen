 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> formed a well supported (91%) monophyletic group with considerable distance from the 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> clade. The only (small) deviation in this block was the ‘Krishna Tulsi’ accession from the Botanical Garden in Milan mentioned above (t1). 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">filamentosum</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">campechianum</italic> formed sister groups that appeared to be monophyletic and were delineated from 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic>, but at lower bootstrap values (50% in case of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>.

 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic> which was also formed a well supported clade (87%) was split into subgroupsthat were more differentiated than the subgroups in the 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> clade, although showing low bootstrap values (~50%). When flower morphology was projected onto this tree, the 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> clade differed from the other clades due to its longer corolla, while in the 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">campechianum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic> clades the corolla was short, such that the anthers protruded significantly. Interestingly, ‘Vana Tulsi’ was closer to the non-
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> clades if flower morphology was considered, although with regard to the genetic markers it clearly associated with the 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> clade.
