<p class="p">Due to the pronounced morphological variability of vegetative organs, the determination of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> species is far from trivial. All accessions were therefore raised to the flowering stage and then their identity verified (and sometimes updated) based on floral traits. Here, a considerable variation in the geometry of flower organs can be observed: while 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic> possess a well-developed upper lip (
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>
 </bold>), this organ is shorter in 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">kampechianum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic>, as well as in the validated specimen of ‘Vana Tulsi’ in our sample. The lower lip was long in 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic>, slightly retracted in 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">campechianum</italic>, shorter in both 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> and in ‘Vana Tulsi’, and very short in 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic>. As a result, the sexual organs in 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> were contingent with the corolla, while they protruded slightly in 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">campechanium</italic>, and in ‘Vana Tulsi’. In 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> and, even more pronounced in 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic>, the anthers were almost freely exposed around 10 mm beyond the edge of the lower lip. These differences in geometrical relations are likely to influence pollination mechanisms or possibly even the spectrum of pollinators, leading to the question of whether they might be linked with genetic channelling leading to incipient speciation. Mutations in barcoding markers, although not under selective pressure, should then segregate between the different lineages.
