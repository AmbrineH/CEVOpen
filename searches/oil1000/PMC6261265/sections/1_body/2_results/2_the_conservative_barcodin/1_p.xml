<p class="p">Among the common barcoding markers, the 1,5-ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase Large subunit (
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic>) is considered to be one of the most conserved loci, because mutations in the coding sequence can impair carbon fixation in the dark reaction of photosynthesis. Therefore, the 
 <italic class="italic">rbcL</italic> marker, while very useful for the discrimination of families and genera, usually shows only poor resolution below the family level [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. When we constructed an alignment of sequences from our validated specimens along with reference sequences recovered from GenBank (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>

 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> (25 sequences), but also 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic> (4 sequences),

 <italic class="italic">x africanum</italic> (4 sequences),

 <italic class="italic">kilimandscharicum</italic> (3 sequences), as well as our validated ‘Vana Tulsi’ (

 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> (12 sequences) as well as our validated

 <italic class="italic">campechianum</italic> sample formed a clearly delineated second cluster. This also included our validated ‘Rama Tulsi’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’ (blue arrow) accessions, as well as one other GenBank sequence that had been deposited as ‘Krisha Tulsi’ (blue arrow), which should probably read ‘Krishna Tulsi’. A second sequence deposited in GenBank as ‘Vana Tulsi’ (green arrow) belongs to the 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic> clade and was declared as such. Both sequences come from a comparative study on Lamiaceae in commercial samples and derive from fresh material collected in the Botanical Garden of Milan without any mention of morphological verification [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. A third clade comprises 7 sequences from 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic> that neighbour 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> and are relatively distant from the 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> haplotype. A fourth, more distant, clade comprises 7 sequences that were available for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">filamentosum</italic>. To test the validity of this topology, we have reconstructed the tree using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. Although most clades were not statistically supported, the two trees showed the same topology (
