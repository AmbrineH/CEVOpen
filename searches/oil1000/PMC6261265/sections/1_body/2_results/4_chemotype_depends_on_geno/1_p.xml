<p class="p">To become of practical relevance for consumer protection, the genetic differences between different Tulsi types have to be reflected by chemical differences. Alternatively, the chemical differences might derive from environmental factors independent of genotype. In fact, the different chemotypes found in the Basils are traditionally interpreted as resulting from cultivation in different areas rather than having a genetic basis [
 <xref rid="pone.0207763.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this has never been addressed by systematic experimentation. We therefore raised different genotypes side by side under different light qualities and then profiled two groups of bioactive fractions by HP-TLC–the water-soluble flavonoids, and the lipophilic essential oils. In a preparatory study, where the three types of Tulsi were compared through development (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207763.s005" class="xref">S5 Fig</xref>
 </bold>), we observed that the profile of flavonoids was strongly dependent on developmental stage, whereby the abundance of compounds increased with the age of the plant. As expected, the abundance of flavonoids in commercial samples of the same accessions (that had been raised under the tropical sun of India) was higher than in plants raised in the greenhouse. However, despite these modulations, the profile of ‘Vana Tulsi’ remained clearly distinct from that seen in ‘Rama Tulsi’ or ‘Krishna Tulsi’. Thus, while the expression of the compound pattern clearly varied depending on developmental stage and cultivation conditions, the pattern itself was constant for a given genotype. In the next step, we compared flavonoid profiles (

 </bold>) and essential oil profiles (

 </bold>) for different accessions of 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic>. Despite an overall congruence of these patterns, there were specific bands, where the accessions differed clearly. For instance, in the flavonoid fingerprint two blue fluorescent bands at R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> ~ 0.6 were characteristic for accessions belonging to haplotype I as defined in 
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>
 </bold>. Interestingly, this band was also seen in ‘Vana Tulsi’ (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A</xref>
 </bold>). Conversely, a green fluorescent band at R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> ~ 0.2 was seen in accessions belonging to 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> (including ‘Rama Tulsi’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’) and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">campechianum</italic>, but was weak or even absent in accessions from haplotype I as well as in ‘Vana Tulsi’. Overall, the flavonoid profile could be matched to the genetically defined haplotypes. The essential oil pattern also showed accession-dependent differences (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g004" class="xref">Fig 4B</xref>
 </bold>). While the essential oil pattern of ‘Vana Tulsi’ clearly differed from the tested accessions of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> including ‘Rama Tulsi’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’, it was also distinct from 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic> (that were also variable). Generally, the profiles seen for the essential oils showed a larger variation between the genotypes and revealed chemotypic differences that were more pronounced than the genetic differences.
