<p class="p">In summary, although the different 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum</italic> accessions respond differently to altered light qualities, and although the amplitude of compound accumulation is modulated by light, and (in a pronounced manner) by the age of the plant, the compound profile itself seems to be quite variable. The conclusion from these experiments is that chemotype depends on genotype, but its expression is modulated by environment and development.
