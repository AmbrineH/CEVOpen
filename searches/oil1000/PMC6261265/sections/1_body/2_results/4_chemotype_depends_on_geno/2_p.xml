<p class="p">The striking trait of ‘Krishna Tulsi’ is its purple colour caused by anthocyanins. Since the expression of anthocyanins is often under the control of photoreceptors, we investigated the extent to which differences in the chemical profiles of ‘Vana Tulsi’ versus ‘Rama Tulsi’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’ might be caused by different lighting conditions during cultivation. This was systematically tested by raising the plants side by side under equal fluence rates of light but under light of different spectral composition. In addition to conventional white light, we tested white light complemented with red and blue light, which should not only activate chlorophyll (this was excluded by keeping the photosynthetically available radiation constant throughout all parallels of this experiment) but would also activate type-II phytochromes (red light) as well as type-I phytochromes (blue light). A third set used white light complemented with long-wavelength UV-A (365 nm) to activate cryptochromes, and a fourth set with white light complemented with short-wavelength UV-B (310 nm) should active the UVR8 receptor. While we were able to see certain modulations in the flavonoid patterns (for instance, in ‘Krishna Tulsi’ a yellow band at R
 <sub class="sub">f</sub> ~ 0.18 became upregulated under UV-B, i.e. under conditions, where anthocyanin expression in most plants is most active), the profile of flavonoids remained unaltered (

 </bold>). The plants were clearly responsive to the changes in light quality, as was visible from the differences in the density of oil glands for different light qualities (

 </bold>). Here, the different genotypes were not only different in terms of overall ability to produce glandular scales, but also in terms of wavelength dependency and responsiveness to altered light quality. For instance, ‘Rama Tulsi’ was effectively insensitive to the modulation of wavelength, while

 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> accession 8098 was most responsive to UV-B light. ‘Vana Tulsi’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’ generally produced a lower number of glands but were stimulated to do so by short-waved irradiation (mostly UV-A).
