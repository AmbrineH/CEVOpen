<p class="p">If the type of ‘Tulsi’ depends on genetic factors rather than on differences in light quality or developmental state, DNA-based assays to discriminate ‘Vana Tulsi’ from ‘Rama Tulsi’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’ should target informative differences in the haplotype. We have used this idea to develop a simple assay making use of a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA</italic> intergenic spacer predicted to cause a differential restriction site for HinfI (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>
 </bold>). As a result, the 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA IGS</italic> amplicon should not be cut for members of the haplotype I, while members of the other haplotypes would become restricted (
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref>
 </bold>). Upon treatment of the 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA IGS</italic> amplicon, one would get for specimens from haplotype I a single band of 420 bp, while for specimens from the other haplotypes, there would be two smaller fragments of 236 bp and 188 bp (
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g006" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref>
 </bold>). We verified this prediction restricting the 
 <italic class="italic">trnH-psbA IGS</italic> amplicon from 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">americanum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. x 
 <italic class="italic">africanum</italic> as representatives of haplotype I and did not see a breakdown of the 420-bp band (
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g006" class="xref">Fig 6D</xref>
 </bold>), while for 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tenuiflorum</italic> a double band at around 200 bp was seen. As to be expected, restriction of Vana Tulsi yielded only the full-length band at 420 bp. Two commercial samples declared to contain ‘Rama’, ‘Krishna’, and ‘Vana Tulsi’ were assayed by the same approach (
 <bold class="bold">
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207763.g006" class="xref">Fig 6D</xref>
 </bold>, 
 <italic class="italic">samples 1 and 2</italic>): in both cases, the full-length band as well as the restriction fragments were found, indicative of a mixed sample containing both haplotype 1 and haplotype 2. Interestingly, sample 2 was declared to contain ‘Rama’ and ‘Krishna Tulsi’, specified as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sanctum</italic>, and ‘Vana Tulsi’, specified as 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic>, i.e. only genotypes that should belong to haplotype 2. Since non-foliar material from other plant material (cinnamon, ginger, pepper, cardamom) had been separated out prior to PCR, the observed fingerprint indicates that the ‘Vana Tulsi’ in the sample (if present) belongs to haplotype I.
