<p class="p">To determine the density of glandular scales, ten leaves per accession and light condition were analysed. Only leaves without any indication of yellowing or wilting were considered. Glandular scales were scored at five fixed positions of the adaxial and abaxial face of each freshly excised leaf (viewed as wholemount specimens) in a window of 430 μm x 330 μm at 20 x magnification under a bright-field microscope (M420, Leica, Bensheim, Germany) with a digital image acquisition system (DFC 500, Leica, Bensheim, Germany). To detect genetic differences between the accessions, the scale numbers per scoring window were compared in relative units between plants raised side by side under identical lighting conditions. Results were analysed using a one-factorial ANOVA for homogeneity of variance, before the detected differences were tested pairwise for significance using a two-sampled t-test.</p>
