<p class="p">For commercial samples, the procedure had to be adapted. Here, the frozen material was ground with liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, and the DNA extracted using the Invisorb MSpin Plant Mini Kit (Stratec Molecular) following the instructions of the producer. Further, for the PCR 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin were added. Amplicons were digested by the restriction enzyme HinfI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt). For the reaction, 10 Î¼l of the PCR product was used and digested following the instructions of the producer. The products were then separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis at constant voltage of 100 V and results were documented by a digital gel documentation system using the fluorescence of SYBRSafe as label.</p>
