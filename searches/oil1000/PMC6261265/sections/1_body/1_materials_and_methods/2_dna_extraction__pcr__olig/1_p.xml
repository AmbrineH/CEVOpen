<p class="p">A small amount (50 mg) of leaf material was harvested, immediately shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. The frozen material was ground using a high-throughput disruptor (TissueLyser, Qiagen, Germany), and the DNA extracted using the InnuPrep Plant DNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel) following the instructions of the producer. Quality was controlled spectrophotometrically (Nano-Drop 1000, peQLab) and by gel electrophoresis. The genomic DNA (50 ng template) was then subjected to a PCR using primers for different plastidic barcoding markers (details are given in

  <xref rid="pone.0207763.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>
 </bold>) with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 95°C, 30 sec annealing at 60°C, and 60 sec synthesis at 68°C using a conventional Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt). Final elongation was 5 min at 68°C. Amplicons were then separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis at constant voltage of 100 V, results were documented by a digital gel documentation system using the fluorescence of SYBRSafe as label. Amplicons were sent for sequencing (GATC, Konstanz, Germany) from both sides, the two sequence reads were aligned using the Alignment Explorer of MEGA phylogenetic software (

Homologous sequences for Ocimum and two outgroups (

 <italic class="italic">Nepeta cataria</italic>) were retrieved from GenBank and aligned after filtering for identity (sequences assigned to the genus, but not a species, were not considered, because they are not informative for this purpose) and authenticity (only sequences from taxa that had been determined by the submitters were considered, in case of doubt, this point was cross-checked by corresponding with the submitting authors). The alignments were trimmed and then used to construct phylogenetic trees either based on the Neighbour-Joining algorithm (model: maximum composite likelihood with uniform rates) or the Maximum Likelihood (model: Tamura-Nei with uniform rates, using Nearest Neighbour Interchange as heuristic algorithm to infer the tree), and bootstraps derived from 1000 replicates, again making use of the MEGA phylogenetic software. In addition to the individual loci, a concatenated alignment was used to infer the phylogeny.
