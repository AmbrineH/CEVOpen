 <italic class="italic">gratissimum</italic>) and cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. For the analysis, sample 1 was used directly, while for sample 2, the non-foliar components were sorted out. Plants were cultivated in individual pots, on a commercial white peat clay substrate (Floraton 3, Floragard, Oldenburg, Germany). All genotypes were raised in parallel in the greenhouse at a temperature of 22°C ± 5°C during daytime, and 18° ± 5°C during the night. The light period was 16 h ± 2 h at around 108 μM
