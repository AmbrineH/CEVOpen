 <p> Discrimination of haplotype I and haplotypes II-IV using restriction length polymorphism of the trnH-psbA IGS marker. A Sequence polymorphism between the haplotypes leading to a differential Hinf I recognition site in case of haplotypes II-IV. B Prediction of the fragment size obtained by Hinf I restriction. C Predicted banding pattern for haplotype I and haplotypes II-IV. D restriction patterns obtained after Hinf I digestion of trnH-psbA IGS amplicons in different accessions of Ocimum. Sample 1 and 2 are two commercial samples declaring to contain ‘Rama’, ‘Krishna’, and ‘Vana’ Tulsi. </p>
