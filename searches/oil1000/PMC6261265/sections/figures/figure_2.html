 <p> Molecular relationships inferred from the RubisCo large subunit ( rbcL) marker. A Evolutionary relationship of 65 sequences for the rbcL marker from Ocimum, along with one sequence from Nepeta cataria and Hanceola sinensis, respectively, used as outgroups inferred using the Neighbour-Joining algorithm. Bootstrap values are derived from 1000 replicates. O bas O. basilicum, O americ O. americanum, O x afric O. x africanum, O kilim O. kilimandscharicum, O tenuifl O. tenuiflorum, O campech O. campechianum, O fil O. filamentosum, O grat O. gratissimum. GenBank accession numbers are shown with each accession, circles represent sequences that had been isolated in the course of the current study, red circle represents the sequence for ‘Vana Tulsi’ that clusters outside of O. tenuiflorum. Blue arrows indicate two accessions that have been reported as ‘Krishna Tulsi’ (both as O. tenuiflorum), green arrows indicate two accessions that have been reported as ‘Vana Tulsi’. Roman numbers represent four main haplotypes. B Signatures of the four main haplotypes defined by the rbcL marker, numbers indicate the nucleotide position in the alignment ( S1 Appendix ). Support is defined as the number of sequences deposited in GenBank that show this signature. Note that the sequence of ‘Vana Tulsi’ falls into cluster I comprising O. basilicum, O. americanum, O. x africanum, and O. kilimandscharicum. </p>
