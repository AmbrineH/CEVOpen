 <p> Chemical profiling of different Ocimum accessions raised side by side in the greenhouse under white light over six months. Flavonoids ( A) and essential oils ( B) were probed by HT-TLC along with reference standards (in case of flavonoids, rutin and hyperoside, in case of essential oils methyl eugenol and ursolic acid). Arrows indicate type-specific bands, green arrow indicates a prominent band in the flavonoid band that is characteristic for accessions belonging to haplotype I in Fig 3, while red arrow indicates a flavonoid band that is characteristic for accessions belonging to haplotype II and IV accessions in Fig 3 . </p>
