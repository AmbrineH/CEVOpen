 <p> Effect of light quality on chemical profiles and glandular scale number in Ocimum tenuiflorum, ‘Rama Tulsi’, ‘Krishna Tulsi’, and ‘Vana Tulsi’ accessions raised side by side in the greenhouse under equal fluence rates (108 μM .sec -1.m -2 ± 30 μM .sec -1.m -2) of either white light (WL), white light supplemented with red and blue light (655 nm, 447 nm, RB), long-wavelength UV (365 nm, UVA) or short-wavelength UV (310 nm, UVB) over six months. Flavonoids ( A) and essential oils ( B) were probed by HT-TLC along with reference standards (in case of flavonoids, rutin and hyperoside, in case of essential oils methyl eugenol and ursolic acid). Profiles for one accession are shown side by side, indicated by colour symbols (RB, red-blue squares, WL white squares, UVB dark-violet squares, UVA light-violet squares). C mean densities of glandular scales on the upper, adaxial, and the lower, abaxial, side of fully expanded leaves given in relative units. Data represent mean values and standard errors from two independent experimental series comprising each three individual plants per accession and ten leaves per plant for each genotype. </p>
