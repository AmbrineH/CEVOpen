 <p> Molecular relationships inferred from the informative positions in a composite alignment of rbcL, matK, trnF-L intergenic spacer, and the trnH-psbA intergenic spacer based on the 79 informative positions in this composite alignment. The inset shows the flower morphology of the different clades. The colour code for upper (circles) and lower (triangles) lips is green long, yellow intermediate, red short. Haplotypes that deviate from the consensus for the respective clade (b basilicum/ americanum/ x africanum/ kilimandscharicum clade, g gratissimum clade, t tenuiflorum clade) are indicated by numbers). </p>
