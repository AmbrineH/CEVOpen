<p class="p">Most studies on alginate coating applications have been conducted at the laboratory scale and commercial applications are still very limited. Further research with practical applications should focus on the industrial implementation to commercialize the alginate coated food products with increased shelf life. Coating application methods can be readjusted so as to implement a recycle process that does not waste too much of coating solution, decrease microbial load of the solution during recycling, design spraying method for irregular surfaces, design industrial size vacuum tanks, etc. to prevent the disadvantages of the application methods. Therefore, sodium alginate-based edible films and coatings could be used to an even greater extent than they are currently.</p>
