<p class="p">Studies about film forming and coating food products with edible biopolymers have been expanded recently. Edible/biodegradable films and coatings can be used to maintain the quality during the shelf life of the product. Promising results have been achieved on fresh cut fruits, vegetables, and meat products coated with alginate solutions with incorporated additives. However, further improvements could be obtained by incorporating new antimicrobial, antioxidative, antibrowning agents to enhance food safety and food quality. A better understanding of any synergistic effect among alginate coating and active agents can be developed.</p>
