 <xref rid="B15-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Mostly, they are large molecules with many hydroxyl groups [

 <xref rid="B20-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Hydrocolloid film applications do not target to control water vapor migration due to their hydrophilic nature [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. However, the continuous polysaccharide film can be referred to as a sacrificial moisture agent. That is, moisture evaporates from the film instead of the food surface [
