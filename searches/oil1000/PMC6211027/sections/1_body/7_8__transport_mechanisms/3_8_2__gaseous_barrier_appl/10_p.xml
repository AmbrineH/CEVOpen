 <xref rid="B200-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>] were evaluated in the literature. Due to being a hydrocolloid, the alginate-based films and coatings generally decreased the respiration rate during storage and, in this way, achieve retention of the quality attributes of the food products. Sipahi, Castell-Perez, Moreira, Gomes, and Castillo [
 <xref rid="B110-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] stated that the LbL coating application method inhibited the respiration process of fresh-cut watermelon.
