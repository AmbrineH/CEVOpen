<p class="p">Gas barrier properties (especially O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) are the second frequently studied transport mechanism. Capillary diffusion (predominant in porous, imperfect materials) and activated diffusion (includes solubilization of the gas in the film, diffusion through the film and release at the other side of the film) are the two mechanisms that occur in gas transport [
