<p class="p">The water vapor barrier properties of alginate films were intended to be improved with the addition of other gel-forming biopolymers. Parris, Coffin, Joubran, and Pessen [
 <xref rid="B81-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] developed alginate-milk based materials (i.e., whole or non-fat milk, whey, sodium caseinate). Films containing whole milk had decreased WVP up to 35% [

 <xref rid="B221-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">221</xref>] have demonstrated that films formed from alginate-whey protein complexes had lower WVP. Rhim, Wu, Weller, and Schnepf [
 <xref rid="B220-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>] found that up to 10% PGA addition decreased the WVP of soy protein isolate films. Han and Wang [
 <xref rid="B143-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>] evaluated the WVP of sodium alginate-CMC films containing pyrogallic acid.
