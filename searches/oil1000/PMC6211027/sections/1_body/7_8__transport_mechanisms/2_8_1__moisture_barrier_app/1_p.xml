<p class="p">Moisture barrier characteristics (i.e., moisture content, water vapor permeability (WVP), water vapor resistance (WVR), and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR)) have been commonly studied in the literature of alginate-based edible films and coatings since moisture barrier properties are very critical in designing the coating process. In raw, untreated fruits and vegetables, epidermal cell layer and cuticles reduce weight loss and edible coatings and films created an additional extra barrier layer on the stomata and decrease transpiration (and, therefore, weight loss) [
