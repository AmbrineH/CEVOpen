<p class="p">There has been an increasing interest in using EOs as antimicrobial agents in alginate coating/film formulations. Rojas-Graü, et al. [
 <xref rid="B233-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">233</xref>] reported that the addition of plant essential oils did not modify the WVP of alginate-apple puree film. Similar results were presented by Norajit, Kim, and Ryu [
 <xref rid="B154-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>] for ginseng extract incorporated alginate films that no significant effect on WVP was observed. On the contrary, Artiga-Artigas, Acevedo-Fani and Martín-Belloso [
 <xref rid="B138-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>] determined that oregano EO incorporated alginate-mandarin fiber coated low-fat cut cheese exhibited higher WVR values than the uncoated samples and the effect increased with increasing concentrations of EO. Kavas, Kavas, and Saygili [
 <xref rid="B136-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>] fortified alginate-whey protein isolate coating with a 1.5% ginger EO and coated kashar cheese.
