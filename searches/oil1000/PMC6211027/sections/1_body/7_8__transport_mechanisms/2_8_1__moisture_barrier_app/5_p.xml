<p class="p">Incorporation of additives can alter the moisture transfer properties of the formed film. Various studies showed that lipid addition into the coating formulation helped to decrease the moisture transport [

On the other hand, the addition of plasticizer to the formulation may increase the WVP values of the film due to reducing the intermolecular bonds between polymer chains [
