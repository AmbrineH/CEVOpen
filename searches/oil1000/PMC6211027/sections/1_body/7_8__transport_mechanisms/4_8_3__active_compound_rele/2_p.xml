<p class="p">The control of the release process with well-determined release rates and migration amounts are very crucial, especially in biotechnology. For this reason, various studies were conducted in the literature. Diffusion of low molecular weight substances such as glucose, L-tryptophan, and α-lactoalbumin and higher molecular weight substances such as albumin, γ-globulun, and fibrinogen [
