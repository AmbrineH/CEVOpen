 <xref rid="B71-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] from alginate films and evaluated the effect of three levels of alginate crosslinking (with different calcium chloride concentrations) on the permeability and release model. As the calcium ion concentration increased, which increased the degree of crosslinking, the mobility of the active substance was prevented and the permeability constant decreased. Moreover, an increase in the sorbate concentration also caused an increase in the permeability values.
