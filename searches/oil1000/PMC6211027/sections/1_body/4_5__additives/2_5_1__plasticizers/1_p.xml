<p class="p">The mechanical properties of biodegradable packages can be improved by the plasticization of the polymer-network with plasticizers, which are generally non-volatile and miscible with the polymer. The primary objectives of the plasticizers are increasing the free volume or molecular mobility of polymers, decreasing the intermolecular forces, bestowing flexibility, reducing brittleness, improving tear impact resistance, and regulating the flow of the coating material [

Furthermore, the plasticizers should have the same solubility properties with the polymer in the solvent system (to prevent plasticizer or polymer separation during film/coating application), possess a high boiling point, and should be able to change the physical and mechanical properties of the substance when incorporated into the formulation [
