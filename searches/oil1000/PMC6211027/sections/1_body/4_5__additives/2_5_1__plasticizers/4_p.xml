<p class="p">In several studies, glycerol has been used as a plasticizer, particularly for alginate films and coatings. However, the amount used is variable. Rojas-Graü, et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] reported that the water vapor resistance (WVR) of alginate coatings increases with an increasing glycerol concentration up to 1.75% (

 <xref rid="B83-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] observed the same type of effect during the optimization of the alginate coating formulation and determined the amount as 1.16% (
