<p class="p">Glycerine and sodium lactate lead to stronger and more elastic alginate-based films compared to sorbitol, which was stiffer [
 <xref rid="B81-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. However, sorbitol added films exhibited better water vapor barrier properties at the same concentration due to being less effective in reducing intermolecular hydrogen bonding between polymer molecules [

 <xref rid="B80-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] compared the effects of glycerol and sorbitol addition to alginate films in terms of their mechanical properties and determined that both plasticizers decreased equilibrium moisture content and porosity. On the other hand, the incorporation of glycerol caused higher WVP and oxygen permeability, while sorbitol did not alter barrier properties [

 <xref rid="B58-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] analyzed the effects of different plasticizers (glycerol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and fructose) on WVP and the mechanical properties of calcium alginate films in two different RH values. WVP increased in the order of fructose, sorbitol, glycerol, and PEG incorporated films. Plasticizers induced a sharp increase in moisture content in the moisture sorption isotherm graphs and modified the mechanical properties with an increasing tensile strength.
