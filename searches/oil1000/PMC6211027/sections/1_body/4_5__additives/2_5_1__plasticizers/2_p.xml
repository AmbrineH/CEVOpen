<p class="p">Water is the most common and most effective plasticizer; still, the plasticizing effect of water in hydrophilic biopolymers is difficult due to the dependency of the environmental conditions such as relative humidity and temperature [

 <xref rid="B80-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Therefore, the type and the quantity of the plasticizer are very important in the designing of the edible coating formulation. Parris, et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] stated that based on the total solid content of the film, the plasticizer amount should be determined between 10% and 25% as lower concentrations cause brittleness whereas higher concentrations lead to stickiness.
