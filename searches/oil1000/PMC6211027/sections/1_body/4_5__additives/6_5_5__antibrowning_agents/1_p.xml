<p class="p">Color is a critical quality parameter. Browning reactions during the shelf life of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables result from both enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds [

 <xref rid="B156-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">156</xref>]. It is well known that browning in fruits and some vegetables mainly originate by the enzymatic oxidation (polyphenol oxidases) of phenolic compounds [

 <xref rid="B157-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>]. Polyphenol oxidase requires oxygen to start browning reactions; therefore, implementing an oxygen barrier can be beneficial in preventing browning [
