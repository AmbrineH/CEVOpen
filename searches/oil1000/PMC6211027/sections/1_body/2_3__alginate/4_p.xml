<p class="p">Alginic acid was first discovered and isolated by Dr. E.C.C. Stanford in 1881 [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Alginates (i.e., sodium alginate (E401), potassium alginate (E402), ammonium alginate (E403), and calcium alginate (E404)) are monovalent salts of alginic acid (E400) [
