<p class="p">This method consists of four steps: sample immersion into the alginate dispersions followed by withdrawing the sample and draining the excessive film-forming solution covering the product. Then, a second immersion of the alginate coated sample into the crosslinking bath to achieve the gel formation and draining of the excessive solution [
