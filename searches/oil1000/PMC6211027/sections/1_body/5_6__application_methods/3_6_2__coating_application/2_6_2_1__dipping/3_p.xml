<p class="p">Due to the hydrophilic surface of the cut surfaces of the food products, a good adhesion cannot be easily accomplished by the simple dipping of the food product into the coating material. Multilayer coating or the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique has been used to minimize the sticking difficulty of the coating on the hydrophilic surface of the cut surfaces [
