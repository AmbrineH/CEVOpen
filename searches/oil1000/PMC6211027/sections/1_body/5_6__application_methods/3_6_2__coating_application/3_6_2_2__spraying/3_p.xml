 <xref rid="B22-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] sprayed the dispersion containing water-soluble algin and, later, a gelling agent on the freshly slaughtered hanging animal carcasses. Researchers determined the viscosity of the solution as the critical point of the vertical spraying application to have a uniform adherence to the alginate film. Papajová, Bujdoš, Chorvát, Stach, and Lacík [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] designed a setup to prepare externally gelled planar alginate hydrogels with the airbrushing aerosols of a gelling solution. Amanatidou, Slump, Gorris, and Smid [
 <xref rid="B148-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>] applied a different spraying procedure. Carrot slices were initially dipped in CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solutions and, following the drying, an alginate-based solution was sprayed on the surface of the slices.
