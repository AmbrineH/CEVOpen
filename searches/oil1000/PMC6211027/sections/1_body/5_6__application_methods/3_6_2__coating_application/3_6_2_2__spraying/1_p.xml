 <xref rid="B172-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>]. The spraying technique needs less amount of coating material to achieve good coverage due to high spraying pressure (approx. 60â€“80 psi) [
 <xref rid="B176-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>]. The other advantages of this method are the uniform coating, control of thickness, possibility of multilayer applications, avoidance of coating solution contamination, temperature control of the solution and enabling of working with large surface areas [
