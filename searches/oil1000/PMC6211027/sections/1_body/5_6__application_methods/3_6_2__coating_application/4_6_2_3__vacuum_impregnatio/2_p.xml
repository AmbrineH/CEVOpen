<p class="p">The VI method consists of the same dipping-draining steps, which were explained in the dipping subsection. However, instead of dipping tanks, the samples are submerged into two airtight vacuum chambers connected to vacuum pumps. Subsequent to the vacuum application, products are subjected to atmospheric restoration while they remain immersed in the coating solution under atmospheric pressure. Vacuum period, vacuum pressure and atmospheric restoration time are important parameters in the VI process [
