<p class="p">It is the most frequently used film-forming technique, which consists of spreading of water or water-ethanol solutions/dispersions on a suitable surface and later air drying during several hours in a ventilated oven such as infrared drying chambers [

The structure of the film is depended on the composition of the casting solution, wet casting thickness, temperature and relative humidity of the drying conditions [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Rapid drying of the casting solution should be avoided due to reducing the solvent concentration very fast, and therefore limiting the mobility of the polymer chain and development of intermolecular interactions in the film [
