   <p class="p">Simple coacervation: The precipitation or phase change of the hydrocolloid, which is dispersed in water, is achieved following to (i) the solvent evaporation process (i.e., drying); (ii) incorporation of hydrosoluble non-electrolyte (in which the hydrocolloid is not soluble, e.g., ethanol); (iii) the pH adjustment with the addition of electrolyte, which impel salting out or cross-linking.</p>

   <p class="p">Complex coacervation: The precipitation of the polymer complex is achieved by mixing two hydrocolloid solutions, which have opposite electron charges.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Gelation or thermal coagulation: Precipitation or gelation is accomplished by heating of the macromolecule which causes its degradation (e.g., proteins such as ovalbumin) or the cooling of hydrocolloid dispersion (e.g., agar, gelatin).</p>
