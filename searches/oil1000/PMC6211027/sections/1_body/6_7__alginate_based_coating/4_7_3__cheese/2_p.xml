<p class="p">Edible coatings and films have been applied and studied in several types of cheese as packaging system to prevent the quality losses. Zhong, et al. [
 <xref rid="B217-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>] investigated the performance of three different coating materials (i.e., sodium alginate, chitosan, soy protein isolate) with four various application methods on mozzarella cheese. The results showed that alginate-coated samples possessed better overall qualities due to its better wettability on the product surface [
 <xref rid="B217-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>]. Lucera, Mastromatteo, Conte, Zambrini, Faccia, and Del Nobile [
 <xref rid="B137-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>] demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity of potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, calcium lactate, and calcium ascorbate, which were incorporated into an alginate coating and used to coat mozzarella cheese, were similar. The main difference arose from the sensory point of view. Kavas, Kavas, and Saygili [
 <xref rid="B136-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>] fortified the composite coating of alginate-whey protein isolate coatings with ginger EO and obtained kashar cheese with a lower acidity and higher fat level.
