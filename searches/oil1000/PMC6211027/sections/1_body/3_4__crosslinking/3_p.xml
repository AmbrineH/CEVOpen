<p class="p">There are two types of procedures for the incorporation of gelling ions into the alginate solution to form hydrogel (i.e., external and internal gelling modes) [

(2) On the other hand, the internal gelling method consists in incorporating an insoluble source of gelling ions with alginate solutions and afterward, the gelling ions are released by processes that lower the pH: the addition of organic acids or slowly hydrolyzing lactones [
