<p class="p">In situ gelation of alginate, and strongly homogeneous structure forming are also an interest of biotechnology (e.g., tissue engineering, immobilization of cell and enzyme systems, carriers for drug delivery system). A technique to prepare homogeneous alginate gels with a slow release of calcium ions has been reported [

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>.2H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O -CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> -GDL) as a gelation agent due to their very low solubilities, which allows for a uniform distribution of the CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in the alginate solution and, therefore, a more controlled and more uniform gel formation. In their subsequent research, the dimensional stability (swelling tendency of the gel due to an increased tendency of the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups to interact with water molecules and osmotic pressure) was controlled by controlling the calcium ion concentration of the external aqueous environment, crosslinking density, and polymer concentration of the gel and chemical composition of alginate [
