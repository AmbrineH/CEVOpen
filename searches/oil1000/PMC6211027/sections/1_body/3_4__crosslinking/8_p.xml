<p class="p">It was pointed out by Pavlath, et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] that two type of reactions take place when an alginate film/coating is immersed in crosslinking calcium solution: diffusion of the multivalent ion which induces formation of calcium linkage with the carboxyl groups for the insolubilization of the alginate film, and the dissolution of alginate by the solution [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. The increased concentration of the multivalent ion diminishes the dominance of the dissolution process [
 <xref rid="B69-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Rhim [
 <xref rid="B70-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] also noticed the same phenomena and added that the method of CaCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> treatment affected the thickness of the film, i.e., direct addition of the crosslinking agent lead to thicker films compared to immersing the alginate films into a crosslinking solution.
