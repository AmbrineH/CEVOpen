<p class="p">The degree of crosslinking affects the swelling ability of the 3D structure of the alginate in the solvent, and we end up with a decrease in the permeability to various solutes and being used in drug controlled release systems [
 <xref rid="B71-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. In the study by Zactiti and Kieckbusch [
 <xref rid="B71-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], the degree of swelling decreased (in other words, the crosslinking was increased) with the increasing concentration of Ca
 <sup class="sup">+2</sup> ions in the crosslinking solution and, therefore, the solubility and elongation of the alginate films decreased, while the tensile strength increased. Similarly, Rhim [
 <xref rid="B70-foods-07-00170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] observed that an increase in the CaCl
