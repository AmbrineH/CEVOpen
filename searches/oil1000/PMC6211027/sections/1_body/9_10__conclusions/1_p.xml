<p class="p">In an ideal case, an edible coating or film should decrease the evaporation of the water content, loss of desirable odor and flavor volatiles, prevent microorganism growth, suppress respiration, and gas exchange; while the modified atmosphere created by the barrier should not cause anaerobic respiration (and, therefore, anaerobic growth) and undesirable volatiles. On the basis of the evaluation of the previous literature on alginate-based edible films and coatings, it can be concluded that the alginate-based edible films and coatings can be efficiently used to accomplish these aims with an enhancing shelf life of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood, and cheese. The information summarized here can lead researchers to design successful coating applications.</p>
