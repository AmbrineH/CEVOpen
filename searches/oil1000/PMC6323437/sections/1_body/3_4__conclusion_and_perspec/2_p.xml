 <italic class="italic">In vivo</italic> tests reported various models of inflammation that resemble human pathologies, including assessment of their mechanism of action, antioxidant enzyme dosages, and molecular effects of EOs. Regarding the rigor of design and study data included in this review, most of the studies presented moderate quality indicating that some aspects still need to be improved but in general provide evidence of the anti-inflammatory potential associated with the antioxidant activity of EOs.
