<p class="p">During chronic inflammation, a variety of intracellular signaling pathways are activated, comprising of cell surface receptors, tyrosine kinases, and transcription factors, leading to overexpression of proinflammatory genes involved in the development of chronic diseases [

Furthermore, the cellular components represented by the mast cells and leukocytes are recruited to the site of the damage, which leads to a “respiratory burst” result of increased oxygen uptake and therefore an increased release and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) at the site of damage [

Under physiological conditions, ROS are generated in phagocytes to neutralise the invading organisms, presenting an important role in the host defense mechanism. In contrast to oxidant mechanisms, the organism has endogenous defense antioxidant systems, including for example superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. When ROS production is greater than cellular antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids [
