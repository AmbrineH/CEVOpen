Essential oils have a complex composition; the great majority of the identified components include terpenes (oxygenated or not), predominantly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. However, allyl and propenylphenols (phenylpropanoids) also are important components of some essential oils [

These secondary metabolites have been related as potent antioxidants, free radical scavengers, and metal chelators, also presenting antinociceptive, neuroprotective, anticonvulsant, and anti-inflammatory properties, reported in preclinical studies, characterizing as potential source for the development of new drugs [
