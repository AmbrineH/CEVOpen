<p class="p">A diversity of protein kinases is activated in the inflammatory process, such as members of the Janus-activated kinase (JAK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/, AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families to alter cell proliferation. In the chronic inflammatory process, the excessive activation of these signaling pathways causes also the activation of certain transcription factors, such as NF-

 <italic class="italic">α</italic>), and activator protein-1 (AP-1), potentiating the initial inflammatory response. In addition to these factors, the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cytokines, and chemokines have also been reported to play a role in oxidative stress-induced inflammation [
