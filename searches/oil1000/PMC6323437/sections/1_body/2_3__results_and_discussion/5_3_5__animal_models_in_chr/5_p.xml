<p class="p">Another widely used model corresponds to the evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which several pharmacological models are employed, such as induction of ulcers by

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. These pathologies are characterized by an excessive response of the immune system of the intestinal mucosa, activating the production and release of inflammatory mediators, such as eicosanoids, cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitrogen. In addition, defense cells such as mast cells produce toxic superoxide anions in the inflammatory environment and recruit neutrophils generating excess ROS, proteolytic enzymes, and ROS that contribute to lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, activated macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells express receptors for IL-1
