<p class="p">Involvement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is also well documented. Inflammatory cell types such as T-cells, monocytes, and neutrophils play major roles in mediating the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis. The deposition of lipid and oxidized low-density lipoprotein contributes to the initial and prolongated inflammatory response, especially in lipid oxidation, which is taken up by macrophages, dendritic cells, and smooth muscle cells to form lipid-laden foam cells. In addition, cells of the immune system participate to the inflammatory process producing proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-
