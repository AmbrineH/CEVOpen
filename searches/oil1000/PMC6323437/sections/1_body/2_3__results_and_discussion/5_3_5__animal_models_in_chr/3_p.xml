<p class="p">In recent years, some reports relate pathogen infection to the development and progression of chronic inflammation. In this systematic review, we found 9 studies reporting inflammatory conditions induced by microorganisms or their components, including LPS from

Some authors suggest that LPS would stimulate inflammation by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species, mainly by the production of superoxide anion (O
