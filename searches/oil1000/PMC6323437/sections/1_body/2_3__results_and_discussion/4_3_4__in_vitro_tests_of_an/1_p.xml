<p class="p">Researchers, when proposing to investigate the pharmacological evaluation of substances, initially carry out 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> tests, since these tests present a high reproducibility and function as a trait to evaluate the pharmacological potential of these substances, as for example the anti-inflammatory activity. The assays employed are, in most instances, cell culture techniques, in which the cells receive various stimuli (chemical or biological) that induce the production of mediators involved in inflammatory processes, such as arachidonic acid and cytokines and their metabolites [
