<p class="p">As described in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, our review included 2 reports presenting in 
 <italic class="italic">vitro</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies, 9 reports presenting only 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies, and 19 reports presenting only 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies. In the studies reported in this review, biochemical and molecular targets were verified by colorimetric and enzymatic assays, biochemical analyses, and techniques such as Western blot and immunohistochemistry. These studies base their assays on methodologies using cell culture commonly found in chronic inflammatory processes, such as macrophages, monocytes, astrocytes, and cancer cells, correlating anti-inflammatory results with the antioxidant potential of essential oil or their major components. The evaluated 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> studies parameters and main outcomes are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>.
