<p class="p">The primary search identified 429 articles (200 from Scopus, 18 from Science Direct, 32 from BIREME, and 179 from PubMed). However, 146 manuscripts were indexed in two or more databases and considered only once, resulting in 283 original articles. After an initial screening of titles and abstracts, 192 articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or presented completely different themes from the proposal of this review. After an initial screening of titles and abstracts and a full-text analysis, 27 articles were considered potentially relevant. In addition, 3 articles were included after manual search for data extraction, totalizing 30 final articles included in this systematic review. A flowchart illustrating the progressive study selection and numbers at each stage is shown in
