 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>], performs a first antioxidant defense in an oxidative stress situation [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Catalase also participates in this defense process, catalyzing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (highly reactive) to water and molecular oxygen, being located mainly in the peroxisomes [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Glutathione exists in two forms with different subunits and different active sites. Glutathione peroxidase catalyzes the reduction of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> or organic peroxides (ROOH) to water or alcohol by the presence of GSH, which is converted to oxidize glutathione during this reaction. The main function of this latter enzyme is the protection of the polyunsaturated cell membranes [
