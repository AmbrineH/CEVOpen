<p class="p">In the articles reported in this study, the authors correlated the antioxidant tests with the anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oils and substances tested. For this, isolated tests of 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antioxidant activity, such as DPPH, inhibition of 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-carotene degradation, ABTS, NO, and FRAP tests, were used as initial screening of the pharmacological activity of EOs or isolated substances. Based on the satisfactory results obtained, some anti-inflammatory activity tests were subsequently conducted [

In these models, the analyses of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and lipid peroxidation were mostly described [
