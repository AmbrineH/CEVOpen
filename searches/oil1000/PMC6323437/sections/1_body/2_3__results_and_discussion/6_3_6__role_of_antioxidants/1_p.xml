<p class="p">Free radicals correspond to a molecule or atom that carries unpaired electrons that makes them highly reactive and unstable and can cause cell damage. In normal cell metabolism, many free radicals are produced, which serve important functions in the signaling of specific pathophysiological pathways, the great majority of these radicals being produced in the mitochondrial metabolism. Examples of these are hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and organic peroxides. In addition, in the absence or low concentrations of oxygen, excessive lipid peroxidation occurs and mitochondria also generate nitric oxide (NO), which can generate reactive nitrogen species, which can produce other reactive species such as malondialdehyde [
