<p class="p">In the inflammatory process, defensive cells located in injured regions lead to a “respiratory burst” in the tissue resulting from increased uptake of oxygen and, therefore, increased production and release of ROS in the damaged area. The release of mediators by these cells associated with the presence of ROS and RNS stimulates signal transduction cascades and alters transcription factors, such as NF-

Metabolites generated in inflammation associated with oxidative stress impair healthy tissue by altering the stroma and surrounding epithelial cells, which after a long period of time can evolve into more serious problems and trigger, for example, carcinogenesis [
