<p class="p">Regarding methodological quality, all 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies were evaluated using a standardized checklist, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. It was observed that all studies described the objectives, outcomes to be measured, and main findings obtained. However, none of the included articles reported sample size calculation. In general, doses, routes of administration, and frequency of treatment were adequately described. Most of the 
 <italic class="italic">in vivo</italic> studies (18 reports, 85.7%) adequately reported the animal allocation, but less than half (10 reports, 47.6%) reported that the animals were randomly housed. In addition, the majority of included studies did not make it clear if the investigators or the outcome assessor were blinded from the treatment used.
