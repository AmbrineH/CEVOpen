<p class="p">Nanoparticles containing thymol were also evaluated, using experimental models that mimic psoriasis. For this, anthralin (1,8-dihydroxy-9-anthrone), a drug used to treat psoriasis, was used for inducing inflammation in healthy skin mice and the antioxidant activity was evaluated after exposition to light, generators, and oxidative stress events. Thymol in nanoparticles showed better inhibition of edema by reducing inflammatory cells in inflamed tissue when compared to free thymol, indicating that nanoparticles improve anti-inflammatory activity mediated by mechanisms that inhibit the formation of reactive oxygen species [
