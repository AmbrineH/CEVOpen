<p class="p">In the experimental models, cinnamaldehyde, 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-elemene, and thymol were evaluated in LPS-induced cardiac inflammation or hyperlipidic diet. Cinnamaldehyde possesses potent anti-inflammation effects on endotoxemia [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] showed that cinnamaldehyde inhibited inflammatory infiltration and the levels of TNF-

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>, and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated rats by blocking the TLR4 and MAPK pathways, associated with the reduction in ROS levels in cardiac tissue [

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Elemene also showed activity in the cardiac inflammation model. In this evaluation, treatment of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice with 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-elemene inhibited atherosclerotic lesions by reducing levels of nitric oxide, cytokines, and oxidative stress indicators and reversing the intracellular ROS production and MAPK signaling activation [
