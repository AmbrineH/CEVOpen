<p class="p">In view of the wide use of traditional medicine associated with its importance in drug discovery, EOs have been studied and their compounds identified/isolated components due to their diverse pharmacological properties, including the treatment of acute and chronic inflammation justified by their antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. EOs are volatile compounds that may contain more than 300 different compounds. Most of chemical constituents are terpenes, especially mono- and sesquiterpenes, but some nonterpene compounds biosynthesized by the phenylpropanoid pathway can also be present in EOs [
