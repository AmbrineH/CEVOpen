<p class="p">CNC is typically produced by controlled acid hydrolysis that selectively targets the disordered cellulose segments present in the source material, leaving the crystallites intact.

 </sup> The resultant nanoparticles are rigid nanorods of highly ordered (crystalline) cellulose. The most common CNC preparation method, via sulfuric acid hydrolysis, installs charged half-ester sulfate groups on the CNC surfaces and ensures their excellent colloidal stability in aqueous media. Resulting from CNCâ€™s inherent chirality or handedness, it self-assembles into chiral nematic liquid crystal phases.
