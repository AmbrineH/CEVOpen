<p class="p">After isolation, the large density of hydroxyl groups in nanocellulose and lignin provides ample possibilities for functionalization, using conventional water- and alcohol-based chemistries.

 </sup> In addition, both nanocelluloses and lignin particles display nonspecific interactions with cellulose derivatives. This facilitates hybridization and multicomponent materials to be formed. Several reviews covering a wide range of aspects related to nanocelluloses are available, including those from our group.

 <italic class="italic">Langmuir</italic> has published a couple of relevant, complementary Invited Feature Articles (see refs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12" class="xref">12</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13" class="xref">13</xref>)). The first reference compared the characteristics and properties of lab-made and industrial nanocelluloses, enticing a growing “optimism” for their deployment in colloidal systems.

 </sup> The second reference discussed the generic use of colloidal particles in a range of fluid/fluid interfaces.

 </sup> Here we expand on the construction of supramolecular assemblies at fluid interfaces, a field that is in the early stages. Lignin colloids are reported less frequently: while many studies are available regarding their isolation, characterization, and modification, very limited knowledge exists regarding their structuring and colloidal behaviors in aqueous suspension, an issue that is covered here, at least partially.
