<p class="p">The recent progress in green, plant-based colloids is swiftly attracting increased interest in both academia and industry. Here we introduce the subject with special emphasis on results from our recent work dealing with the development of multiphase systems, particularly for the stabilization of oil/water interfaces. The colloidal stability and parameters affecting such properties are all important when formulating emulsions. In addition, the size, geometry, and morphology of plant-based colloids provide new insights and opportunities to address emerging applications. We highlight a range of uses for plant-based colloids: in helping to minimize the use of petroleum-based substances, in endowing mechanical strength, in reducing materialsâ€™ cost, and in developing advanced green materials. Our anticipation is that this discussion will trigger ideas for the development of new platforms with impact in colloidal and material systems. Finally, it is feasible that new opportunities may emerge by taking advantage of the synergies between nanocelluloses and lignins.</p>
