<p class="p">Generally, lignin is removed during isolation of fibers. However, it has been realized that many advantages may materialize if (residual) lignin remains in the isolated “ligno-nanocelluloses”. Indeed, this enables some level of control on their interactions with water, depending on the composition and type of lignin (which depends on the precursor plant source).

 </sup> Thus, we propose that consideration should be given to (1) lignocellulosic colloids (colloids containing cellulose and bound lignin), (2) those inherently produced as mixtures containing nanocellulose and lignin, and (3) colloids that combine the single components (isolated nanocelluloses and lignins derived from the same or different sources). It is for this reason that we discuss both nanocelluloses and colloidal lignins separately but with an appreciation for new possible uses if they are recombined strategically.
