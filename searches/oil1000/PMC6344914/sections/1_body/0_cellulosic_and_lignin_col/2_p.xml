<p class="p">In plants, cellulose is the main load-bearing component, forming semiordered microfibrils. Lignin, on the other hand, is often considered to “act as a glue” between the fibrils and fibers. This is, however, an oversimplification because other functions are equally important. Lignin is mostly derived from plants, while sources of cellulose also include bacterial biofilms and sea animals.</p>
