<p class="p">The most readily available source of nanocelluloses and lignins are plants, wood, and forest products as well as side streams generated during their processing. Within nanocelluloses, CNFs are usually obtained by disintegrating the fibersâ€™ cell walls by strong mechanical shear, following appropriate pretreatments, e.g., selective acid and enzymatic hydrolysis

 </sup> or chemical oxidation. For instance, catalyzed oxidation is one of the few processes that isolates truly individual CNF, such as TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-oxyl radical)-oxidized nanocelluloses,

 </sup> which display uniform lateral dimensions. By contrast, intensive mechanical shearing results in a more heterogeneous distribution of the lateral dimensions of CNF. The relatively high axial ratio of CNF, coupled with its flexibility, promotes entanglements that together with hydration and electrostatic interactions (if present), trigger the formation of hydrogels at very low concentrations.
