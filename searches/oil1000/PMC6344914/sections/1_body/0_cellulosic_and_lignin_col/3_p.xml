<p class="p">Among the various cellulosic materials, the recent popularity of nanocelluloses stems in part from their fibrillar or rodlike nature, nanometer size in the lateral dimension, tailorable crystallinity, and structuring capabilities, which equip them for a vast number of applications. We consider two basic types of nanocellulose, rodlike cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and cellulose nanofibril (CNF), where the latter displays a higher axial aspect. They contain ordered structures with packed parallel cellulose chains that form a dense network held together by van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>
