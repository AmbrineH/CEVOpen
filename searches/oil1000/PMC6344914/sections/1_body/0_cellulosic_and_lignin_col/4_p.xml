<p class="p">To keep the internal native crystalline structure, the most common route to access nanocelluloses is by disintegration of the plant cell walls. Thus, unlike most synthetic nanoparticles, most nanocelluloses are produced top-down and preserve, to some degree, the biologically derived morphology and ordered structure of cellulose in plant cells. Therefore, the processing method greatly influences their characteristics, including dimensions, composition, molecular integrity, and crystallinity, among other properties.</p>
