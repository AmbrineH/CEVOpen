<p class="p">High surface area, multifunctionality, and controlled network structuring are easily obtainable with synthetic particles owing to the bottom-up synthesis where the process itself can be adjusted in terms of the monomeric precursor, the initiator and, if applicable, the emulsifier used (e.g., in latexes).

 </sup> This is in contrast to natural organic colloids that comprise a polymeric backbone, when extracted from plants or obtained from bacteria. Additionally, synthetic particles can be obtained in sizes ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometers, whereas the range of dimensions of plant-based colloids is somewhat limited by the source; moreover, they are inherently polydisperse.
