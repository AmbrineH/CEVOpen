<p class="p">The library of available options is rather large if one considers the currently available nonbiobased, synthetic particles (either organic or inorganic), which have been designed to adsorb at the oil/water interface, principally in Pickering systems. The synthesis of anisotropic organic and inorganic particles has been expanding, for several decades now, following progress of surface chemistry to control their morphological properties. An example is that of spherical silica or latex particles that have been used for nearly a century. Highly reproducible and facile synthetic protocols have been developed for the fabrication of spherical particles, but this is quite different in the case of anisotropic ones, which demand considerably more tedious processes. Compared to plant-based particles, a significant drawback of the synthetic counterparts is their expected nonbiodegradability. In some cases, they can also be a toxicological hazard to humans, directly or indirectly, for example, via the food chain. Related effects are being evaluated for plant-based materials, and so far they have been found not to elicit immune reactions, even after prolonged exposure after introduction intracutaneously in model animals.
