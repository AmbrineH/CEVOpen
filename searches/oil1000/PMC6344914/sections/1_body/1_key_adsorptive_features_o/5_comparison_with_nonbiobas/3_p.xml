<p class="p">Anisotropic inorganic particles are generally obtained with sizes &lt;1 μm, commonly synthesized from building blocks such as silicates, gold, or metal-oxides. They find use in the stabilization of interfaces and outperform spherical particles because of their higher contact area relative to their mass or volume (

 </xref>f). Nevertheless, those particles are rigid in nature and cannot conform to any given surface.

 </sup> When the length of such inorganic nanoparticles becomes considerable in comparison to the radius of curvature of the interface, a smooth adsorbed layer cannot be attained and “hedgehog”-type structures result, with the particles organizing tangentially to the interface.

 </sup> Therefore, controlling the source of nanocelluloses and the size of the crystalline domains offers the possibility to tether interfacial adsorption that cannot yet be achieved with inorganic systems.
