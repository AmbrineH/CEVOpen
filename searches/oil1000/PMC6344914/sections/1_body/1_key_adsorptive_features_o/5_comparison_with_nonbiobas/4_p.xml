<p class="p">Synthetic anisotropic particles obtained from organic materials, mainly polymers, are generally obtained with sizes above one micrometer except for oblong micellar assemblies, bottle-brush polymer particles, and replica particles obtained from inorganic templates. These have been used only scarcely for the stabilization of interfaces but have found applications principally as biofunctional particles and rheology modifiers. Polymeric bottle-brush architectures are a good example of a versatility that is not yet available from plant-based particles. For instance, the aspect ratio of bottle-brush polymers, their size (from nanometers to several micrometers), functionality, responsiveness, and flexibility can all be engineered at once, subsequently highlighting an extremely high degree of versatility as a result of a long history of developments in synthetic chemistry (

 </sup> Therefore, although not fully studied yet, all of these qualities are expected to allow control of interfacial interactions.
