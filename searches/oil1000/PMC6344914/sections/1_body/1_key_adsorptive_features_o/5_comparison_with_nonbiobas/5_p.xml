<p class="p">To fulfill an increasing demand for sustainable materials, plant-based colloids have been isolated or designed to exploit some of their unique physicochemical properties, while suppressing the production cost and promoting eco-friendliness. Although fine process engineering is required for large-scale production, isolation of plant-based colloids can benefit from the adoption of green routes
