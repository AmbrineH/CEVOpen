 </sup> Lignin particles can be prepared from industrial side streams by using a number of methodologies. They are generally designed to be spherical; therefore, their interaction at the oil/water interface follows previous findings for particles of synthetic origin with the same shape (

 </xref>e). The interaction of lignin macromolecules with a given solvent depends on factors such as ionic strength, pH, temperature, solvent quality, and, importantly, monolignol composition in the lignin.

 </sup> In most solvents, lignin is mostly found as associated structures, for example, in the form of cylindrical building blocks having 4â€“10 monolignol units, where the amount of monomers per building block is influenced by lignin concentration.

 </sup> An attractive aspect of lignins is their versatility because they can be obtained with given chemical composition, molar mass, and solvent affinity, depending on their source and separation process.

 </sup> While this can be upsetting for cracking the macromolecule into monomeric precursors, it is an advantage in the domain of colloid science, as a toolbox with a variety of choices as far as the expected interfacial behaviors.
