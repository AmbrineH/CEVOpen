 </sup> The case of fluid interfaces is less common in natural system but of high technological relevance. Here, the adsorption strength of natural colloids at fluid interfaces is largely associated with the ability of a given fluid to wet the surface of the particles.

 </sup> Thus, a key advantage of utilizing plant-based colloids is the possibility of selected chemistries and reaction conditions that can be introduced during their isolation, conducted either by bottom-up or top-down approaches. Importantly, the geometry and morphology of the particles are to be considered as additional, critical parameters that significantly modulate their functions.

 </sup> When evaluating the physicochemical properties of colloids interacting at the oil/water interface, several aspects come into play, including (i) the balance of interaction energies of the particle at the oil/water interphase, (ii) particle’s adsorbed conformation at the interface, and (iii) the relative magnitude of interfacial area covered by the particles relative to their size or volume (

 </xref>a–c). Accordingly, the interactions between the particles and the given phases are favored by the right hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance, which is dictated by the inherent surface chemistry, the particle’s dimensional anisotropy, and the molecular and colloidal flexibility.
