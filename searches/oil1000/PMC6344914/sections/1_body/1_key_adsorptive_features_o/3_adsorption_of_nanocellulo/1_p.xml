<p class="p">The wide choice of plant-based colloid morphology and rigidity can be conveniently selected, depending on their origin and method used for their isolation. Also, their surface chemistry can be easily altered. Apart from their eco-friendliness and bio/economic integration, they offer unique properties compared to conventional, synthetic colloids (those produced from metals and minerals or petroleum-based polymers). Still, significant challenges need to be addressed for interfacial stabilization when adopting biocolloids, also including other polysaccharides, proteins, extractives, and biogenic minerals.</p>
