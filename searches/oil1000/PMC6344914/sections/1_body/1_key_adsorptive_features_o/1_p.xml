<p class="p">Relevant to this contribution is the fact that phenomena such as stability, surface reactions, and mobility play critical roles in determining the behavior and fate of colloidal particles, whether they are of synthetic or natural origins. A main emphasis of our work is the introduction of plant-based colloids in the stabilization of multiphase systems, particularly the emulsionâ€™s oil/water interfaces. The associated processes and the state of dispersion are principally regulated by the nature of the colloidal particles and the conditions of the surrounding medium as well as the presence of dissolved substances.
