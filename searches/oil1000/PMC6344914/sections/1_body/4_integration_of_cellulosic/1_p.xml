<p class="p">It is reasonable to discuss nanocelluloses or lignin particles together because they are both sourced from plant biomass, where they are the main components. They also form stable colloidal systems in aqueous suspension. However, there is perhaps a more compelling motivation: nanocelluloses carrying residual lignin exhibit properties that make them unique. Such synergies have been studied to a very limited extent. In addition, the integration of lignin (as lignin particles) with nanocelluloses can become quite attractive if one reflects on recent developments that exploit the strong interactions between these two components. This goes from ultrastrong wood panels that are obtained upon densification of cellulosic fibers in the presence of lignin

 </sup> In fact, earlier we introduced the subject when researching the role of residual lignin in films or nanopapers comprising “ligno-nanocellulose” (see refs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21" class="xref">21</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22" class="xref">22</xref>) and references therein). The question remains whether similar compositions are effective in stabilizing fluid/fluid interfaces. This is yet to be determined but is a topic currently under our consideration. In retrospect, such possibilities are not surprising if one reflects on the role of cellulose and lignin in the cell wall of plants. Therein, strong interactions and synergies are part of a multifunctional and hierarchical structure that responds efficiently to several demands.
