<p class="p">The phenyl-propane monolignols (p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl) of lignins are linked to form complex, 3D-branched structures possessing a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic side chains that effectively reduce the surface tension of water.

 </sup> This ability of lignins has been noted to depend on the molecular weight, types of functional groups, and solubility. The behavior of lignins at the oil/water interface, however, is different from that of most conventional synthetic surfactants. High concentrations, from 1 to 10%, are needed to effectively lower the surface tension, and instead of undergoing micellization at the cmc, associative structures are formed by lignins. Lignin stabilizes emulsions by adsorption at the oil/water interface, which prevents droplet coalescence by electrostatic and steric repulsion (

 </sup> Importantly, the possible presence of residual molecules cannot be ignored, such as extractives and carbohydrates (as in lignin-carbohydrate complexes), which even if present in very small amounts affect the overall surface activity of the “lignins”.
