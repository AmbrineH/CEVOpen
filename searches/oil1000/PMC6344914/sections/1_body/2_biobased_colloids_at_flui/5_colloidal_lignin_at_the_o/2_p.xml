 </sup> The results showed that higher molecular weight lignins were more surface active. Sjöblom et al. studied the effect of molecular weight of lignosulfonates on the stability of O/W emulsions with a light petroleum (C9–C16) distillate.

 </sup> They concluded that lignins adsorbed at interfaces and promoted flocculation by bridging adjacent droplets; higher molecular weight fractions of lignin resulted in enhanced stability.
