<p class="p">Functional groups, carbonyls, carboxyls, and aliphatic-hydroxyls present in the structure of lignins, play important roles in the hydrophilicâˆ’lipophilic balance. Similar to the monolignols, functional groups exist on the lignin, depending on the lignin, depending in its source and, together with molecular weight, can vary according to the extraction processes. For instance, coming from the sulfite pulping process, lignosulfonates contain considerable amounts of sulfite and hydrogen sulfite ions, which make this lignin water-soluble at neutral pH.

 </sup> Kraft lignins, presenting lower levels of sulfur and being by far the most widely available, have also attracted attention, but they may require chemical modification (e.g., carboxymethylation or acetylation) for changing their solubility and surface activity at neutral pH.
