<p class="p">From green and sustainable perspectives, there is a need to develop facile, efficient methods to control the behavior of nanocelluloses at the oil/water interface. The combination of the two types of nanocelluloses to exploit their synergies is a highly attractive alternative. Recently, we investigated a system that included both CNC and CNF in a single stabilization step.

 </sup> CNC primarily stabilized the (sunflower) oil/water interface, via adsorption. Moreover, at given amounts of non-adsorbing CNF, depletion effects developed, which changed the aggregation state of the oil droplets, via either depletion flocculation or depletion stabilization (

 </xref>a). At low CNF concentration, creaming of the oil droplets occurred because of the difference of density of the phases. At intermediate CNF concentration, significant flocculation occurred, induced by osmotic effects between droplets in the presence of CNF (

 </xref>c). Upon further increasing of the concentration of CNF, depletion stabilization took place (

 </xref>b). It should be noted that the oil/water interface stabilized by CNCs was intact and no droplet coalescence was observed, owing to the formed, mechanically robust interfacial layers. The results form the basis of an approach that uses non-adsorbing CNF to control the interfacial and bulk behavior of CNC-stabilized emulsions.
