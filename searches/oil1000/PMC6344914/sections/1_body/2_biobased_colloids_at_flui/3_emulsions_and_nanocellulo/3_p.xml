<p class="p">Recently, we used a food-grade cationic surfactant, ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE), to engineer the behavior of CNC at the sunflower oil/water interface.

 </xref>a): three interfacial adsorption regimes at given surfactant loading were observed, depending on its structure adsorbed on CNC, as unimer or as adsorbed admicelles. For instance, at low LAE addition, the emulsion droplets were stabilized by complexes containing partially neutralized CNC. At medium LAE concentration, the system underwent a transition from nearly neutralized CNC aggregates to CNC aggregates containing adsorbed LAE bilayers or admicelles. At high LAE concentration, the oil droplets were stabilized by both the complexes containing fully covering CNCs and by LAE molecules. Finally, the oil phase type influenced the interfacial behavior of CNC. Both, CNC/LAE complexes and LAE molecules contributed to stabilize viscous, nonpolar sunflower oil. In contrast, when a less viscous oil was used, only LAE adsorbed at the interface, and CNCs were preferably located in the bulk of the aqueous phase.

 </sup> The results demonstrate a promising opportunity to controllably tune the interfacial adsorption of CNC by introducing a cationic surfactant, depending on the oil composition.
