 </sup> Among them, facile surface modification helps to engineer the properties of nanocelluloses and to tune their behavior at the oil/water interface.

 </sup> The effect of nanocelluloses, when used as a component of surfactant-stabilized emulsions, favors systems with water as the continuous phase. In practice, this means that emulsion inversion from oil-in-water (O/W) to water-in-oil (W/O) is prevented; see

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>
 </xref>c for a map illustrating the possible emulsion morphologies, depending on the composition and formulation variables. More specifically, observations as far as the effect of nanocelluloses in surfactant-stabilized emulsions indicate that the presence of cellulosic nanoparticles is akin to the effect of a viscosifying additive that displaces the transitional inversion line. For example, the presence of nanocelluloses limits emulsion inversion from O/W type to W/O type, as is normally done by changing a formulation variable, for instance, by increasing the salt concentration in emulsions stabilized by ionic surfactants. This is equivalent to moving the inversion boundary upward, as illustrated. Moreover, if the formulation variables are selected in such a way to produce oil-continuous systems in the absence of nanocelluloses (W/O emulsions, for example, if the formulation favors interactions with the hydrophobic phase), the addition of nanocellulose makes more likely the persistence of drop-in-drop or multiple emulsions of the water-in-oil-in-water (w/O/W) type. In effect, this is qualitatively equivalent to a shift to the left in the position of the catastrophic inversion line of

 </xref>c. Note that the changes in the transition boundaries described here are to be taken only as illustrations to rationalize the effect of nanocelluloses because, to our knowledge, such phenomena have not been shown experimentally.
