<p class="p">Besides the surface engineering of CNC by adsorbing oppositely charged surfactants, a more sophisticated but useful approach is to apply nanoparticleâ€“surfactant systems (NPS) in situ.

 </sup> CNC-based NPS were generated at the toluene/water interface via electrostatic interactions between charged groups of CNC and amine end-functionalized polystyrene originally dispersed in toluene. Structured liquids, generated by interfacial effects, assembly, and jamming of NPS took place, forming a robust barrier with exceptional mechanical properties (

 </xref>b). The pH-switchability of amine groups enabled a controlled response of the CNC-based NPS. Taking advantage of these effects, a jet of CNC aqueous suspension free-falling into a toluene solution produced aqueous tubules (stabilized when the CNC-surfactants were jammed at the interface).
