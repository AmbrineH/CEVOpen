 </sup> The results indicated that the interactions between anionic CNC and cationic alkylammonium surfactants (dodecyl dimethylammonium bromide (DMAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) significantly affected the interfacial behavior of CNC. Specifically, aggregation of surfactant molecules on CNC occurred when the concentration of surfactant exceeded the apparent critical micelle concentration (cmc),

 </sup> which dramatically increased the hydrophobicity of CNC and enabled better wettability at the oil/water interface. By adsorbing cationic DMAB, which contains two alkyl tails, a double transitional change was observed, from enhanced interfacial bending for CNC toward dodecane at low DMAB concentration (O/W,
