 </sup> Nanorods with lengths ranging from 185 nm to 4 μm (aspect ratios ranging from ca. 13 to 160), were found to irreversibly adsorb at the oil/water interface. The formed oil droplets showed similar diameter, indicating that CNCs presented roughly the same interfacial wetting properties as well as flexibility at interfaces. The aspect ratio more directly influenced the interfacial coverage on the oil droplets, that is, CNCs with small aspect ratio formed a dense layer (coverage &gt;80%) while an interconnected network of low coverage (40%) took place for the longer nanorods (

 </xref>a). Furthermore, the shorter nanocrystals were shown to promote individual droplets, whereas longer nanorods were involved in networked structures. In fact, more than half of the introduced, 4 μm nanorods were involved in the formation of the interfacial network; meaning that a substantial proportion formed extended bridges between adjacent droplets (

 </xref>b), again demonstrating that the aspect ratio significantly affects the adsorption of nanocelluloses at interfaces. The results lead to a better understanding of adsorption for rodlike particles of given sizes and to the elaboration of controlled surface architectures, from a homogeneous monolayer to interconnected porous multilayered interfaces.
