<p class="p">The interfacial properties of nanocelluloses with various shapes and surface chemistries, produced by acid hydrolysis of eucalyptus fibers (CNCa) and enzymatic hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose (CNCe), respectively, were compared to reveal their surface activity and ability to form Pickering systems.

 </sup> Compared to CNCa, CNCe showed a larger affinity for hydrophobic surfaces. The possible presence of surface-bound proteins (residual cellulolytic enzymes) may partially explain this observation along with the distinctive surface roughness that was proposed to be of major impact on the ability of CNCe to stabilize sunflower oil/water interfaces. These results give rise to the fact that the interfacial behavior, and thus the applications of CNC, can be tuned by controlling its surface properties and shape.
