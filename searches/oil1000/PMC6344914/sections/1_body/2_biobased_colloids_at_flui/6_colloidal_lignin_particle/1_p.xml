<p class="p">Recently, spherical lignin particles have been proposed as promising alternatives to stabilize Pickering emulsions (

 </sup> a method for producing lignin particles via aerosol flow was introduced, and particles with different hydrophilicity (originating from Kraft and Organosolv lignins) were used to formulate Pickering emulsions. Briefly, a lignin solution was atomized and subsequently dried during flow through a heated laminar flow. With this method, dry particles with sizes ranging between ca. 30 nm and 2 μm could be produced and fractionated by size. Oil-in-water Pickering emulsions were prepared, and their stability was shown to depend on particle size, concentration, and surface energy. More specifically, more stable emulsions were obtained using Kraft lignin particles with the smallest average particle diameter, ∼0.4 μm, at the highest concentration used, 0.6% w/v in water. This was somewhat unexpected because it is known that the barrier for desorption of particle-stabilized emulsions increases with the particle size, as was shown in related systems.

 </sup> One can speculate that one reason for the higher stability observed with the smaller lignin particles may be related to the size polydispersity and number density.
