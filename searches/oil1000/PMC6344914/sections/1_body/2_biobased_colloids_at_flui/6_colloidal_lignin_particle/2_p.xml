<p class="p">When considering lignin type, compared to Kraft lignins, those from the Organosolv process display an enhanced hydrophobicity and lower interfacial affinity. The surface characteristics of lignin particles (chemical composition, wettability, and electrostatic charge), which can be tuned readily (from its origins or depending on the source as well as isolation methods and possible postmodification), makes them ideal for interfacial modification and for tailoring their behavior at a given oil/water interface.</p>
