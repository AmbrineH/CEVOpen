<p class="p">CNC can be easily modified using numerous reactions,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup> and it is possible to take advantage of an interesting property: CNCâ€™s cellulose chains are arranged in a parallel configuration, resulting in crystals bearing reducing and nonreducing end groups. Such chemical anisotropy, as far as the difference in reactivity of the ends of the crystal,

 </sup> allows for asymmetrical or end-selective modification (

 </xref>c). An efficient chemical route to introduce chemically versatile thiol groups at the reducing ends of CNC was reported by us.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68" class="xref">68</xref>
 </sup> Thiolation of CNC at the reducing end was carried out by first carboxylation of the reducing end aldehyde groups followed by reaction with 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide-1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino) propyl carbodiimide (NHS/EDC-mediated activation) and final reaction with nucleophilic amine molecules carrying thiol termini. The selectivity and extent of thiolation at the reducing end of CNC were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy imaging of silver nanoparticles that tagged the CNC termini. These results revealed the inherent chemical asymmetry of CNC and presented a precise control over CNC self-assembly behavior on surfaces, broadening the applicability of CNC in versatile technologies.
