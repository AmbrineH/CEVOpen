<p class="p">Fascinating aspects of nanocelluloses, which attract considerable attention, are their tailorable fibrous morphology and surface properties. Cellulosic particles isolated from different sources, following given methods, display various sizes and axial length ratios which can induce special structuring and adsorption behaviors. This is not the case of colloidal lignin, mostly forming spherical morphologies. Remarkably, CNC displays an intrinsic right-handed chiral twist (

 </xref>a, left), enabling it to form liquid crystals above a given concentration, depending on its aspect ratio, crystallinity, and surface charges.

 </sup> The helicoidal twist along its longitudinal direction has been directly proved by electron tomography (

 </sup> Furthermore, in given conditions and upon drying from aqueous dispersion, CNCs preserve their initial self-assembled, cholesteric nematic phases and produce photonic band gaps in the visible region due to the twisted rodlike shape and anisotropic charge distribution.

 </sup> The chirality of crystalline cellulose provides great opportunities for functional and advanced applications of CNC in structured assemblies.
