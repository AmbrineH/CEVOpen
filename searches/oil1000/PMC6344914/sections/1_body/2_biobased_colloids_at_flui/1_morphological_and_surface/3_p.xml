<p class="p">One question that emerges is still how nanocelluloses dynamically interact at the oil/water interface. This was investigated by using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS),

 </sup> which suggested that CNC adsorbed as monolayers with varying surface density, mainly depending on interparticle interactions. Interfacial multilayers can also be formed if the CNC bears no charges, for example, after desulfation of CNC produced via sulfuric acid hydrolysis. Furthermore, the neutron wave vector dependence with the intensity showed that CNCs were in contact with the oil only via their surfaces but did not penetrate the bulk phase; no deformation of the oil surface at a nanometer scale was revealed. The results reinforce the hypothesis that the (200) crystalline plane of CNC directly interacts with oil and clarifies that the interaction is limited to interfacial contact. Similar interfacial contact behavior of CNC at the oil/water interface has been shown by molecular modeling (
