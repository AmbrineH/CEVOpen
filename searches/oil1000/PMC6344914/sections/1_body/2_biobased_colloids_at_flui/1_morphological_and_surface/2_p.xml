 </sup> Nevertheless, the potential of nanocellulose to self-assemble at the oil/water interface has been successfully exploited in a variety of applications, both of fundamental and practical importance.

 </sup> In the context of this invited feature article, it is critical to understand the characteristics and dynamic behavior of nanocelluloses at the oil/water interface. One of the major factors that dictates their behavior at interfaces is how they achieve interfacial adsorption or attachment to the nonpolar phase (oil). The crystalline faces of nanocelluloses are structurally nonequivalent, showing one with a partial hydrophobic character.

 </sup> Capron et al. found that the amphiphilic character of CNC, observed for the Iα and Iβ cellulose lattices, relied on the (200)β/(220)α hydrophobic edge plane. Therefore, CNC could adsorb with this less polar crystalline plane for which axial CH moieties are directly exposed at an edge truncation at the surface of the crystal.

 </sup> Thus, the wettability of CNC at the oil/water interface is controlled by their crystalline orientation (

 </sup> Moreover, a recent study investigated the relationship between bending characteristics for all plane directions of CNC.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64" class="xref">64</xref>
 </sup> It was found that the bending angle that reached the plastic deformation limit was approximately 60° in all directions, and particularly, the (200) crystalline plane presented higher bending potential compared with the others. This finding provides evidence that the specific crystalline plane of CNC can bend along the oil/water interface, that is, the small deformation of CNC, accommodating to the curvature of oil droplets, promotes interfacial wetting and adsorption.
