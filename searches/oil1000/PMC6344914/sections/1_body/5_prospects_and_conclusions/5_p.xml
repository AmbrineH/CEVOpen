<p class="p">Research on the dynamic behavior of plant-based colloids at interfaces is of great interest. They can reduce the need for synthetic materials used in colloid systems and will open new opportunities for revealing novel functional applications of structurally defined natural nano- and microparticles. We leave this feature article with some questions that were partially addressed but remain open for discussion: What factors affect the assembly of plant-based colloids at the oil/water interface? What are the dynamics of nanocelluloses and lignin particles adsorbed at the interfaces? What applications and properties are possible as a result of the stabilization of fluid/fluid interfaces, in the form of emulsions with given morphologies? How can nanocelluloses and lignin particles be combined to develop yet new compositions that exploit their interesting synergies? Are there other plant-based colloidal materials that should be considered, for example, heteropolysaccharides, proteins, and extractives?</p>
