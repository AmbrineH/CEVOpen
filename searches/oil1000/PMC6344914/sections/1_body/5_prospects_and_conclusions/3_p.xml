<p class="p">Lignocellulose as a renewable feedstock makes a good case to respond to the demands for sustainable use of natural resources and environmental consciousness. Moreover, there is an interest in exploiting lignocelluloseâ€™s unique functionalities. Specifically, in the colloidal forms (here nanocelluloses and lignin particles), they combine their intrinsic features and their characteristic shapes and sizes toward a large variety of promising performances. Triggered by their fascinating properties, especially the distinctive interfacial behavior, advanced applications of ligno-nanocellulose at the oil/water interface will develop extensively and profoundly, evolving from fundamental insights to practical aspects. The inherent ability of ligno-nanocellulose to self-assemble at the oil/water interface facilitates supra-structures and highly hierarchical assemblies. They also allow functional products because of the strong interfacial reinforcement effect, presenting potential advantages in the fields of drug delivery, personal care, porous material, etc.</p>
