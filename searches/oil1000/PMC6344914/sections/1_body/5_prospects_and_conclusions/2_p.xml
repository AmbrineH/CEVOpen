<p class="p">Considering previous sections on stabilization of oil/water interfaces, any application makes the adjustment of the supramolecular interactions imperative to separate and disperse the nanocelluloses. Grafting polymers opens ample possibilities to alter the hydrophobicity for self-assembly and, importantly in the present context, to incorporate supramolecular moieties to tune the organization and properties at the oil/water interface.</p>
