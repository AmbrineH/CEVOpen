<p class="p">Further understanding and unveiling the dynamic partitioning and assembly behavior of ligno-nanocellulose at the oil/water interface, related to the interfacial free energy during and/or after adsorption, remains challenging. Modifications of ligno-nanocellulose can bridge the gap between bulk properties and unique product functions; however, the modification always leads to alterations of physicochemical properties, which is undesirable for green resources. As for the toxicity of modified ligno-nanocelluloses, efforts should be devoted to maintaining its biocompatibility while achieving the expected performance. Furthermore, although ligno-nanocellulose has been commercially used in the biobased field, developing facile, efficient, and green technologies for production and postprocessing should be considered.</p>
