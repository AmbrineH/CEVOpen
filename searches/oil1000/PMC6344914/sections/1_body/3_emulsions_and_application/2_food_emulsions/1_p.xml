 </sup> Research on food emulsions stabilized by particles has mainly focused on fat crystals, inorganic particles, protein-based nanoparticles and chitin nanocrystals, used as stabilizers. Few efforts using nanocellulosic particles in food-grade emulsion systems have been reported.

 </sup> Lignin and nanocelluloses for food have been limited by uncertainty in their availability, regulation, and cost structure, but this situation may change rapidly, with the prospects of several commercial units opening production.
