 </sup> The combination of CNF and guar showed better stability compared to a commercial control sample. CNF was reported to have a positive effect on the mouthfeel of the mayonnaise. Mikulcov√° et al. studied the encapsulation of essential oils (cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and limonene) with carboxylated CNC and CNF to produce emulsions with antibacterial properties against typical food-borne pathogens.

 </sup> According to their results, the droplet size of CNC-stabilized emulsions was smaller compared to CNF-stabilized emulsions. CNF-based emulsions were reported to be stable during a two-month storage without creaming, which was attributed to a formation of a strong fibril-droplet network due to the high aspect ratio of CNF.
