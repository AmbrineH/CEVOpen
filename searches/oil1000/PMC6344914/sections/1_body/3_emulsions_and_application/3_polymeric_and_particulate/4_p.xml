 </sup> The emulsion properties were influenced by salinity and grafting density, given that they affect lignin aggregation. Thus, emulsions with a wide range of properties could be produced. The development of gas-switchable Pickering emulsions stabilized by 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA)-modified lignin particles was reported by Qian et al.
