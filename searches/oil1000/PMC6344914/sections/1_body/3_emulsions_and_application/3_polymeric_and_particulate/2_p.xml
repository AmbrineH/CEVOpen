<p class="p">Surface roughness is a key factor for tuning the interfacial properties of colloidal particles, given the effective increase of overall surface area of the particles. It also has a consequence on the contact angle that influences particle adsorption behavior at interfaces

 </sup> In our recent efforts, wrinkling and other surface morphologies of colloidal lignin particles produced from the aerosol method were investigated by harmonic analyses.

 </sup> It was shown that different morphologies were related to the onset of buckling transition during the drying phase of the aerosol flow synthesis. Such changes were time-dependent, going from spherical droplets, over crust and buckling formation, to final structures exhibiting wrinkling and crumpling (

 </xref>b). Wrinkled lignin particles showed a similar surface roughness spectrum, wherein differences were found most noticeable in the large-wavelength region. The results are useful in efforts to design particles with tunable interfacial behavior and wettability. Furthermore, they provide a means to improve our understanding of the role of surface topography on colloidal interactions. Finally, incorporating corrugated surface features in plant-based colloids might offer an avenue for effectively utilizing, modifying, and extending their properties.
