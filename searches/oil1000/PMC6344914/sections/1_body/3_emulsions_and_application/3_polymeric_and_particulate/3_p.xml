<p class="p">Microcapsules with different properties for utilization in various applications can be made via Pickering emulsion templates stabilized by lignin particles. Yi et al. successfully utilized lignin nanoparticles as a barrier to obtain a multilayer composite microcapsule via a Pickering emulsion template accompanied by in situ interfacial polymerization of a melamine formadehyde prepolymer (PMF) (

 </sup> Furthermore, the mean diameter of fabricated microcapsules decreased with increasing lignin content (

Isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) was richly and efficiently loaded into a lignin nanoparticle-based Pickering emulsion to produce a self-healing composite. IPDI reacted with water and moisture to form a solid. Thus, IPDI-loaded microcapsules were incorporated into epoxy coatings, and their anticorrosion effect was demonstrated on a steel plate (subjected to accelerated corrosion tests by immersion in a brine solution).
