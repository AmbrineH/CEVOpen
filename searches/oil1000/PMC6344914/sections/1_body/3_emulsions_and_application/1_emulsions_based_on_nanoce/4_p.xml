<p class="p">In the case of W/O emulsions, surface modification is critical for emulsion stabilization, e.g., by affecting the wettability of the cellulosic particles.

 </sup> Lif et al. studied water-in-diesel emulsions using nonionic surfactants, sorbitan monolaurate, and glycerol monooleate as emulsifiers and hydrophilic or hydrophobic CNF as a stabilizer.

 </sup> The motivation for producing water-in-diesel emulsions was to improve the emission profile in combustion compared to regular diesel. For hydrophobization, CNF was treated with octadecylamine or poly(styrene-
 <italic class="italic">co</italic>-maleic anhydride), given that silylation was not suitable for fuel applications (silicon poisons the exhaust catalyst). It was concluded that both the surfactant and the stabilizer were needed to produce reasonably stable emulsions. The most stable emulsions were obtained by combining hydrophobic and hydrophilic (unmodified) CNF. Cunha et al. hydrophobized CNF and CNC with lauroyl chloride, which stabilized W/O and o/W/O double emulsions.

 </sup> In the double emulsions, unmodified nanocelluloses were used to stabilize the inner, oil/water interface, while the modified nanocelluloses stabilized the outer, water/oil interface.
