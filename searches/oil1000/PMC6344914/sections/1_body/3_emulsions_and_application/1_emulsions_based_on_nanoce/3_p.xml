<p class="p">In addition to modifying nanocelluloses for emulsion stabilization, increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase is also of interest. Because of the long fibrillar structure and high aspect ratio of CNF, they can be effective in the stabilization by their effect on the continuous phase.

 </sup> The addition of surfactant is also useful in tailoring the properties of the emulsion. For example, we showed that the morphology, viscosity, and stability of emulsions can be tuned, depending on the concentration of CNF and sodium dodecyl sulfate.

 </sup> When the CNF content was increased, the viscosity of the continuous phase was enhanced, the droplet size reduced, and emulsion stability improved.

 </sup> We used a nonionic surfactant to compatibilize CNF with polystyrene (PS) in w/O/W double emulsions (see also

Such a system makes it possible to compatibilize phases with different polarity and, upon removal of the solvents, to produce composite polymeric structures with high interfacial areas, which is appealing for numerous applications. Because of the shear thinning behavior of double emulsions containing CNF and PS, electrospun nanofibers could be fabricated from such precursors (
