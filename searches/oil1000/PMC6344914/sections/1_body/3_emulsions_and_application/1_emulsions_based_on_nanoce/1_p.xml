<p class="p">The capability of nanocelluloses to stabilize an emulsion depends on many variables, such as source, aspect ratio, and surface charge, among others. Because of the natural hydrophilic character of cellulosic nanomaterials, most efforts in this field have focused on O/W emulsions. However, W/O or double emulsions can also be formed by chemically modified nanocelluloses, via hydrophobization or surfactant complexation (
