 <p> Schematic illustration of (a) emulsification process toward stable CNC-based Pickering emulsions followed by addition of CNF. (b) Three stabilization regimes were induced, depending on CNF concentrations. (c) Depletion flocculation of oil droplets in the CNC-stabilized Pickering emulsions was observed with nonadsorbed CNF reaching the critical flocculation concentration.
