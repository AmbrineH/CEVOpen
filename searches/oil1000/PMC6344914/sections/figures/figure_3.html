 <p> (a) Schematic representation of droplets with adsorbed CNC of different axial ratio: CCN (cotton-based CNC, left), BCN (bacterial-based CNC, middle), and ClaCN (Cladophpra-based CNC, right). Individual droplets (top) and the Pickering emulsion system (bottom) are shown. (b) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of polymerized styreneâ€“water emulsions stabilized by CCN (left), BCN (middle), and ClaCN (right). Reproduced with permission from ref ( 45).

(c) A generic visualization of emulsion formulation showing the interplay between formulation and composition variables, leading to different emulsion morphologies, including double or multiple emulsions (see text). </p>
