 <p> Lignin at the oil/water interface. Mechanisms and properties affecting the behavior of lignins at the oil/water interface as (a) macromolecular colloids and (b) as particles. In panel a, associated molecules display interfacial activity and stabilize the oil/water interface by adsorption of such structures. In panel b, the colloidal particles adsorb via typical Pickering stabilization. </p>
