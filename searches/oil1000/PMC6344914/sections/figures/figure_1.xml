  <p class="p">Examples of biomass-derived, inorganic, and synthetic particles. (a) Characteristic chemical groups present on solid particles and interactions with a nonpolar oil affecting adsorption. (b) Adsorbed particle anisotropy and (c) flexibility favors both interactions and structuring (close packing) at the interface. (d) (left) Cellulose nanofibril (CNF) adsorbed on a flat surface showing flexible domains and kinks (see small squares) with the crystal domains limiting their flexibility.
