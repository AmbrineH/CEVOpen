 <p> (a) Schematic representation of an anionic surfactant/oil/water (SOW) system containing CNFs. (a 1) O/W or (a 2) inverted W/O emulsions are formed by tuning the salinity (wt %) and CNF concentration. Adapted from ref ( 90). Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society. (b) O/W emulsions with oils of different viscosities stabilized by dissolved, modified lignin (see cryo-TEM of emulsified oil drops). Adapted with permission from refs ( 81 and 82). Copyright 2016 Wiley-VCH and Elsevier, respectively. (c) Lignin particles with uniform size synthesized from lignin solutions by surfactant-stabilized W/O emulsions. Adapted with permission from ref ( 83). Copyright 2015 Royal Society of Chemistry. (d) Fluorescent and SEM images of oil droplets surrounded by lignin particles obtained from emulsion precursors (see panel c) or from the aerosol flow method. Adapted from ref ( 46).
