<p class="p">A more recent strategy for limiting some drawbacks of bioplastics is the preparation of multilayer polymeric systems, usually achieved by film blowing of different biodegradable polymers through coextrusion. Being an emerging trend, only few papers report on this approach and several limitations still need to be solved, such as unsatisfactory interlayer adhesion, poor mechanical performance, and thermal degradation of the polymers during film-blowing operations.</p>
