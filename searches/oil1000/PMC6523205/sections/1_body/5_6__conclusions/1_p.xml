<p class="p">The main degradation pathways of the most important bioplastics and related systems were discussed. The reports from the literature revealed that PLA, PBAT, and starch can be degraded in real field conditions, i.e., both on the soil and buried in the soil. Biopolymers and bioplastics are prone to degradation by UV radiation and microorganisms. Several biodegradable polyesters proved to undergo both enzymatic (induced by lipases) and chemical (in NaOH solution) hydrolysis, while being quite stable under acidic conditions.</p>
