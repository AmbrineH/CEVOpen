 <xref rid="B23-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] focused on the processability and properties of PLA films, using spray-dried, lignin-coated cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as fillers and choosing film blowing as a processing technique. They found that lignin coating enhanced the dispersion of CNCs as well as interface adhesion with PLA, leading to significant improvements of the storage modulus even with very low amounts of CNCs (0.3â€“0.5 wt %), attributed to the very good dispersion which promoted an increased PLA crystallization.
