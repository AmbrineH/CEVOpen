 <xref rid="B89-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] prepared blown films from PLA/PBAT and PLA/PBS blends in the presence of polypropylene glycol di glycidyl ether as plasticizer and compatibilizer. The processability was adequate and the tearing strength showed a maximum like trend in the investigated composition range, with the tensile strength in the range 12–24 MPa, the elongation at break in the range 150–260%.
