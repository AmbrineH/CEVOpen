 <xref rid="B37-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] studied the rheological properties of biodegradable polymers subjected to film-blowing processing, as well as the mechanical properties and the suitability to industrial scale film-blowing operations. The investigated biodegradable polymers were from the MaterBi
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> and Bioflex
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> commercial “families”. Also, different blow-up ratios and draw ratios were chosen. The study allowed selecting the most suitable biodegradable polymers from a range of systems coming from the above reported commercial families.
