 <xref rid="B91-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>] attempted to overcome PLA fragility by using palm oil deodorizer distillate (PODC) as additive. They prepared blends where rigidity and glass transition temperatures were not changed much, while the elongation at break increased significantly; the additive also acted as a processing aid during the film-blowing operation.
