 <xref rid="B88-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] prepared films from poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT) blends via melt blending and film blowing, also using a commercial chain extender containing epoxy functional groups and investigating the effect of the latter on the mechanical, rheological, morphological and thermal properties. They found significant improvement of mechanical properties such as elongation at break, tensile strength and tear strength upon using a small amount of the chain extender; scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed an enhanced compatibility due to its presence. Furthermore, the sealing strength of PLA/PBAT/ADR film was evaluated and found to be higher than that of PLA/PBAT, suggesting suitability for shopping bags applications.
