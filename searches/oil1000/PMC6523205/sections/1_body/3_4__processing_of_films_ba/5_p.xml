 <xref rid="B90-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] focused on the unsatisfactory water vapor barrier properties of PBAT films, preparing nanocomposites films containing organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT), via film blowing and biaxial orientation. They also compared the results with those predicted on the basis of the Bharadwaj model. It was found that the barrier properties greatly improved on increasing the OMMT percentage, although a plateau was reached; on the other hand, the elastic modulus systematically increased up to the maximum investigated OMMT amount (13 wt %) while the elongation at break reached a maximum (5 wt %) and then dropped. The relationship between clay amount and water vapour permeability was found to be in good agreement with the model, and dependent on the orientation (parallel to film surface) of the clay platelets.
