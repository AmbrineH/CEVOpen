 <xref rid="B92-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] prepared blown films from PLA and PBAT were produced using an epoxy functionalized-poly(lactide) (EF-PLA) in order to provide some degree of compatibilization (through the epoxy groups reacting with the PBAT) as well as an improvement of the rheological properties. They found that the compatibilizer enhanced the melt strength, thus allowing use of higher PLA amounts (up to 70%) and especially to have higher bubble stability. Furthermore, the typical static charge build-up was reduced. At the same time, mechanical properties such as dart resistance were found to be significantly improved (up to 400%).
