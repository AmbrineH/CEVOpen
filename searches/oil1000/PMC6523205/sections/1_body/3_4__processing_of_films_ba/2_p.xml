HC content was between 10% and 50%, and average thickness was 60 Î¼m. Furthermore, maleic anhydride functionalized ethylene elastomers were used as compatibilizers. It was found that compatibilized showed interesting mechanical and thermal properties, suggesting a possible suitability to applications in packaging and agriculture.
