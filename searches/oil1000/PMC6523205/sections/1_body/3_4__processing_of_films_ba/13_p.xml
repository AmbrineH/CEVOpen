<p class="p">Basically, all the studies focused on processing of bioplastics pointed out that during melt compounding, these biodegradable polymers tend to undergo hydrolytic degradation and/or Î² C-H scission reactions. In this context, some nanocarbon-based fillers could be used to avoid the risk of thermal and chemical oxidation of bioplastics during melt processing [

Another possibility relies on the use of natural antioxidants, such as polyphenols, essential oils, lignin nanocrystals, vitamins, which offer several benefits in terms of safety, health and environmental sustainability [
