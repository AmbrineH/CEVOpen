 <xref rid="B94-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] studied thermoplastic starch blends (based on potato starch, glycerol and water) in order to find the most suitable processing conditions, including temperature, glycerol amount and moisture content in a film blowing operation. Natural starch grade, as well as an oxidized and hydroxypropylated grade, were used. Natural starch processability was significantly more difficult and sticky behavior was one of the major problems encountered. A reasonable compromise was found with approximately 20% glycerol and approximately 10% moisture content.
