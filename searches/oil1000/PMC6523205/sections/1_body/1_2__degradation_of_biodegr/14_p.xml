 <xref rid="B53-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] provided information on biodegradable PBAT in quite different environments, finding a faster degradation rate when buried in soil rather than under laboratory conditions (in a Xenon tester); for instance, the elongation at break dropped from 900% to 70% in one month, versus 6 months in laboratory. Most of these changes were attributed to surface morphology modifications (cracks and holes), suggesting that the enzyme-related hydrolysis of PBAT is actually controlled by surface mechanisms, especially in the presence of fungi rather than bacteria. As regards the UV degradation, it was found to be controlled by the photochemistry of the terephthalate moiety.
