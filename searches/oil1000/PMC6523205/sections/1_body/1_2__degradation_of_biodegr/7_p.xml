<p class="p">Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] prepared a review, discussing different kinds of polymeric degradations along with their mechanisms, including thermal degradation, photo-oxidative degradation, catalytic degradation, biodegradation, mechanic-chemical degradation and ozone-induced degradation, highlighting how different polymers can behave in a consequently different way according to the actual degradation environment and the mechanisms involved. This was confirmed also by the studies of Ramasubramanian [
 <xref rid="B47-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] in his review on polymer degradation mechanisms, providing also some possible parameters affecting the degradation process and stating that the degradation process is affected not only by molecular weight, chemical structure and bond type, but also by the nature and mechanism of the degradation process.
