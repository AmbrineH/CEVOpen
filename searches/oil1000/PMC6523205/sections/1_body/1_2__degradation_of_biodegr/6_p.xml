<p class="p">Enzymatic biodegradation of PCL and PLA is shown to be extremely fast when accomplished by outdoor living organisms (bacteria and fungi), typically present in the soil, whereas biodegradation in the human body, for instance, due to the lack of suitable enzymes, is extremely slow, ranging from 6–12 months for PLA to 2–4 years for PCL, depending on starting crystallinity and molecular weight [

In fact, bio-resorbability of these polymers involves a two-stage mechanism: hydrolysis of ester groups occurs in the first stage, while the intracellular digestion is carried out by macrophages only in a subsequent stage, that is when the polymer molecular weight is low enough, and crystallinity degree is extremely high [
