 <xref rid="B52-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] studied the actual degradability, both enzymatic (induced by lipases) and chemical (in NaOH solution) of several biodegradable polyesters, such as poly(butylene succinate adipate) (PBSA), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(butylene succinate)/poly(caprolactone) blend and PBAT. In enzymatic degradation, PBSA was shown to be significantly degradable, while PBAT was not degraded much by several kinds of lipases, due to its aromatic ring. In NaOH solution, the degradation rate of PES was quite faster than in the other polyesters; furthermore, degradation rate of PBSA in such conditions was lower than in enzymatic degradation.
