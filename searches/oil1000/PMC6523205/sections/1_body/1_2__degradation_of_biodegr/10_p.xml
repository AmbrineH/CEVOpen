 <xref rid="B49-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] studied the biodegradation of neat poly(DL-lactide) (PDLLA), PCL and a partially miscible PDLLA/PCL blend in compost, up to 12 weeks. They found that the PCL proved to be stable against abiotic hydrolysis due to its semicrystalline structure and hydrophobicity, in agreement with the previously reported discussion on the degradation mechanisms of PCL, while the PDLLA degraded quite fast due to its amorphous nature. With regard to the blend, an interesting result was found: its continuous PDLLA phase accelerated the hydrolysis of the PCL phase. In compost, the degradation kinetics appeared to be generally faster.
