The hydrolytic degradation studies were carried out both in water and in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), finding higher degradation rates than in the case of linear PCL (weight loss approximately 20% in 60 weeks) after immersing the samples either in water or in PBS conditions; similar findings were reported for enzymatic (Pseudomonas Lipase) degradation, although the 20% weight loss was reached in a shorter time (14 weeks). However, the changes in some properties, such as crystallinity, crystal size and elastic modulus were smaller in the latter case, thus suggesting significant differences between the two degradation mechanisms (hydrolytic and enzymatic), in agreement with the previously reported studies.
