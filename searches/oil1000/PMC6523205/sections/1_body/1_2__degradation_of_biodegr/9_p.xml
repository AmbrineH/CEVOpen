Several phenolic constituents, including proanthocyanidins, were found in NSE and their actual radical scavenging action was assessed. They found that NSE acted as a thermal stabilizer for PLA and PE films. Under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, NSE was found to be more effective in protecting PE rather than PLA, mainly because of a combination of peroxy radical scavenging and inhibition of Norrish-type photolytic cleavage.
