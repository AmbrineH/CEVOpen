 <xref rid="B54-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] provided further insight regarding the degradation paths of PBAT-blends, testing biodegradable films (respectively, PBAT/PLA, PBAT/PPC and PBAT/Starch) in real field conditions, i.e., on the soil or buried in the soil, thus investigating on the actual role of UV radiation and microorganisms. Indeed, it was found that biodegradation could occur onto the soil, but the early stages were mainly attributed to UV radiations. Regardless of the different materials tested (although the main component was, in all cases, PBAT, therefore it could be expected that the other components may not have significant impacts on the degradation process), the worsening of mechanical properties was always correlated with crosslinking phenomena of the PBAT fraction and consequent formation of a gel fraction.
