<p class="p">Biodegradable polyesters are prone to several degradation mechanisms that may occur depending on the processing conditions. Hydrolysis of ester linkages is a water-induced degradation mechanism, whose rate and extent depends on water concentration, pH, eventual presence of acid or base catalyst, morphology of the polymer and temperature [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00651-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A provides two common degradation pathways proposed for PLA: hydrolytic chain scission (subpanel a) and main chain scission, i.e., β-C-H hydrogen transfer (b). Hydrolytic degradation in PLA can take place during melt processing or in aqueous media. In the former case, it can be activated by the presence of moisture at high temperatures, in the latter, hydrolytic reactions display pH-dependent kinetics, being particularly faster under alkaline conditions. In both cases, the degradation determines a dramatic molecular weight reduction and can be easily monitored by spectroscopic measurement of –OH and –COOH groups, since the degradation products are hydroxyl- or carboxyl- terminated PLA. In the case of β-C-H hydrogen transfer, instead, carboxylic acid end groups and vinyl esters are formed. Moreover, at high temperatures (above 200 °C), the main degradation mechanism of PLA is trans-esterification, which leads to the formation of cyclic oligomers.
