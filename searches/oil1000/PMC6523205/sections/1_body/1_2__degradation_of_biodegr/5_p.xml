<p class="p">Hydrolytic degradation of poly(α-hydroxyl) esters can proceed by either surface or bulk degradation pathways, with these latter being regulated by mass transfer phenomena (diffusion) and kinetics of chemical reactions [
 <xref rid="B43-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. If the rate of hydrolytic chain scission is faster than that of water diffusion into the polymer bulk, the hydrolysis occurs only at the polymer–liquid interface, thus resulting in the progressive thinning of the sample, whose bulk properties, in terms of molecular weight and crystallinity, remain unaltered. Otherwise, when water diffusion is faster than hydrolytic reactions, hydrolysis takes place randomly throughout the entire polymer bulk. This aspect leads to an overall and uniform decay of molecular weight. Oligomers and monomers that are formed diffuse out, thus causing gradual erosive phenomena until achieving the equilibrium between diffusion and chemical kinetics. Whether this equilibrium is hindered, the accumulation of -OH and -COOH terminated byproducts may trigger an internal autocatalysis that accelerates the bulk degradation with respect to that of the outer layers. In this case, a bimodal distribution of molecular weights would be observed, with a degraded inner core and a less altered skin. As the oligomers become small enough to diffuse throughout the structure, this latter tends to be hollowed.
