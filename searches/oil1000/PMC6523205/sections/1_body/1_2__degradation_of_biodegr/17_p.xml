Blends were prepared by different methods and, depending on this, miscible or partially miscible blends were obtained. In the case of miscible blends, the authors carried out the hydrolytic degradation for approximately 400 days, finding that the adipate sequences on PBAT copolymer are more prone to degradation. The degradation rate was found to decrease slightly in the presence of PH, depending on its amount, thus suggesting a way to tailor the actual degradability.
