 <xref rid="B50-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] studied the thermal stability of PLA/PCL blend nanocomposites containing TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTâ€“IR) spectroscopy. The neat PCL showed better thermal stability but, on the other hand, neat PLA showed to a higher activation energy of degradation: this suggests that the degradation rate is more temperature-dependent, probably due to a degradation mechanism based on chain scission and re-formation. However, the PLA/PCL blend showed a reduced thermal stability, although the addition of TiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> nanoparticles helped to improve it.
