<p class="p">As regards the behaviour of other biodegradable polymers such as MaterBi
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> in a marine environment (i.e., a condition which is currently of topical interest by the mass-media), the study from Muller et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] should be cited. They took into account the decay behaviour of three types of shopping bag polymers (standard, degradable, and biodegradable plastic) in sea turtle gastrointestinal fluids. In particular, a standard bag was based on HDPE, degradable bag was made of a proprietary material composed of either PE or PP with additives, while a biodegradable bag was based on MaterBi
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>. Over a 49-day observation period, only negligible degradation rates (based on mass loss) were found for the standard and the degradable plastic, as expected; on the other hand, up to 9% was found for the biodegradable bag, lower than the degradation rate typically expected for industrial composting conditions.
