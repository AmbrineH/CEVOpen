 <xref rid="B80-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>], some researchers have recently studied the of recycling biobased nanocomposites [

 <xref rid="B81-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. With particular reference to PLA, it is known that this polymer undergoes thermodegradation during melt processing [

 <xref rid="B82-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] and, therefore, its recyclability is strictly related to the actual extent of thermodegradative phenomena during melt processing [

 <xref rid="B81-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] investigated the effect of silk nanocrystals (SNC) on thermal and rheological properties of PLA subjected to repeated extrusion operations; they found that the presence of SNC slows down the thermal degradation of PLA. Peinado et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] studied the effects of extrusion on the rheological and mechanical properties of PLA filled with nanoclays; they found that, although both PLA and nanocomposites show viscosity decreases after each processing step, there was no major reduction of the mechanical performance.
