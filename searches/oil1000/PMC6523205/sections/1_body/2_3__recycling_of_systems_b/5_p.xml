<p class="p">It was generally observed that upon reprocessing cycles, the properties of biodegradable-based nanocomposites depends on to two opposite effects: (i) chain scission due to thermo-mechanical degradation, and (ii) filler dispersion effect resulting from multiple processing. Although the latter phenomenon may prevail at low reprocessing cycles, the former proves to be dominant at higher cycles. Among possible strategies were proposed the reactive extrusion with chain extenders or branching agents [
