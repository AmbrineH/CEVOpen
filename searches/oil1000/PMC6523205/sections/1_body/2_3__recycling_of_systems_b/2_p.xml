 <xref rid="B69-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] may sound odd, considering that polymers are regarded as a sustainable alternative for oil-derived polymers since they come from renewable resources and since they are biodegradable/compostable; however, there are several reasons to suggest that recycling of bioplastics is a sensible strategy. These are mainly related to the growing industrial demand and to the fact that recycling is crucial to the reduction of non-renewable resources consumption (including the energy demand linked with their production). Furthermore, some commercial bioplastics do not undergo severe degradation under normal conditions, and the disposal of bioplastic-made items leads to the disposal of valuable raw secondary materials [
