<p class="p">Among the polyesters, poly-caprolactone (PCL) has traditionally found applications in the fields of biomedicine and food packaging. With respect to PLA, it presents lower stiffness and tensile strength but higher stretchability and better processability. Moreover, the temperature required for its melt compounding (below 100 Â°C) allows it to be incorporated in a broader spectrum of natural additives for food packaging, especially those prone to thermal degradation/deactivation [
