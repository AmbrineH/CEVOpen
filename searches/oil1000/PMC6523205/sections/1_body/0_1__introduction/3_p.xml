<p class="p">Several biodegradable polymers were developed and many of them showed good potential for several applications. Among them, poly-lactic acid (PLA) probably attracted the greatest interest for several applications; in fact, being bioresorbable and biocompatible, this polyester is mainly employed in biomedicine for the preparation of tissue-engineering scaffolds, drug-delivery devices, biosensors, and is considered one of the most promising for food-packaging applications [
