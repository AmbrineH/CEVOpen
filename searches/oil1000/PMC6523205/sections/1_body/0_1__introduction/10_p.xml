<p class="p">In this brief review, some general information will be provided with regard to the environmental performance of biodegradable polymers and biodegradable polymer-made systems, with concern to their degradation behavior and their possible recyclability features, and actual recycling paths; subsequently, an overview specifically focused on the processing of biodegradable polymer-based films and on the manufacturing and properties of biodegradable polymer-based multilayer films will be discussed. There will be no focus on biomedical applications, since it would be out of the scope of the brief review.</p>
