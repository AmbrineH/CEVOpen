 <xref rid="B16-polymers-11-00651" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] prepared a biodegradable, multilayer sandwich structure, consisting in two PLA layers with an interposed graphene oxide (GO) layer. The preparation of the sandwich structure was performed by hot pressing, using a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) layer as binder between PLA and GO.
