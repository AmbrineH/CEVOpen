<p class="p">Unfortunately, the solution-based methods, previously described, are adequate for manufacturing multilayer films only on laboratory scale, but not enough for large-scale production. On the other hand, a suitable technology for mass production is extrusion, and particularly film blowing, which is known to be a highly efficient technique for the industrial production of polymeric films [

However, it has been widely adopted, so far, for the production of multilayer films of petroleum-derived polymers, while there are only few examples in the scientific literature of film blowing of biodegradable polymers through coextrusion. Cunha et al. [
