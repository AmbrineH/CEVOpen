Then, a third layer (made of PHBV or alginate) was added to the previously described bilayer, by solvent casting. In particular, the assembly of these three-phase systems was performed by hot-pressing. As observable from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00651-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the SEM micrograph shows a good adhesion between the zein layer and both of the other two (alginate and PHBV). With regard to the optical properties of the film, it was observed that the incorporation of cinnamaldehyde, as well as the presence of the third layer, lowered the overall transparency. The authors also showed that the release of the active component, i.e., cinnamaldehyde, is controlled by the presence and the kind of the third layer.
