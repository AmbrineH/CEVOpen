<p class="p">Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that TTO comprise a large number of components and it is likely that their mode of action involves several targets in the bacterial cell [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The observed different antimicrobial activity might depend on the different percentage of TTO components in liquid as well in VP assays, suggesting that additional investigations on the activity of a specific component against a specific microorganism should be further encouraged.
