<p class="p">As expected, head space analysis showed that the lightest components (α-pinene, β-pinene) were more represented than the heaviest ones (terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol). This phenomenon was particularly evident for α-pinene, leading to the speculation that it might contribute to the high antibacterial activity of TTO in VP against CR-Ab. However, the presence of other trace components could also be important, given that they could act synergistically to exert the antimicrobial action.</p>
