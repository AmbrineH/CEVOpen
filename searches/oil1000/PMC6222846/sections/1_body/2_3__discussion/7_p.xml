<p class="p">In addition, being aware that hospital pneumonia cases are usually caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], the potency of TTO was also evaluated in the VP [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Even though the VP efficacy was globally lower than that observed with the disk diffusion analysis (liquid phase), antibacterial activity was retained against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and both CS and CR-Kp whereas no activity was found with regard to MSSA, MRSA, and CR-Pa. Interestingly, TTO in VP maintained an elevated activity towards CR-Ab, thus corroborating the results obtained by Miao Li et al in their model of pulmonary delivery of tea tree oil-b-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. It seems that no VP assays have yet been performed against other MDR and PDR Gram-negatives. If confirmed, the observed effectiveness of TTO VP against CR-Ab might have a critical clinical impact for the therapy of CR-Ab lung infection.
