<p class="p">As well as for Gram-negative bacteria, local and systemic infections caused by MRSA represent a therapeutical challenge for physicians [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The present investigation showed that the addition of TTO at OXA sub-inhibitory concentrations was able to be reduced from 64 to 2 μg/mL its MIC, being OXA one of the more active beta-lactam against

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Killing studies confirmed that low concentrations of TTO (0.25–0.5%

 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) combined with OXA at concentrations equal to (2 μg/mL) and just lower than (1 μg/mL), the breakpoint for methicillin-susceptibility, obtained a potent concentration-dependent bactericidal and synergistic activity, with absence of bacterial growth after 24 h of antibiotic challenge. Although the MIC/MBC values of TTO against MSSA/MRSA were comparable with those obtained by a previous study [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], the killing results were slightly different, possibly due to the different concentrations used for the experiments (up to 3% compared with 5%

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Herein reported synergistic analyses confirmed the indifference between TTO and VAN, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], whereas the novelty of this report is based on the observation (by both synergistic and killing studies) that the addition of TTO at sub-inhibitory concentration indeed restored MRSA sensitivity to OXA. Based on literature survey, no similar results have been yet described with TTO and MRSA and they appear to be crucial when considering the possibility of combining TTO with beta-lactams for MRSA infection. In fact, the activity of other EOs was evaluated against several MRSA strains [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] and the tendency of EOs to reduce antibiotic resistance was observed, with the combination natural compounds–synthetic drugs inducing the reversal of resistance in bacteria toward antibiotics such as penicillin [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], ampicillin/sulbactam [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], carbapenems [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], and oxacillin [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The mode of action of antimicrobial combination leading to the synergism is still an area of active research and it is probably attributed to the perturbation of bacterial membrane or the inhibition of PBP2a activity or its reduction [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] exerted by natural compounds.
