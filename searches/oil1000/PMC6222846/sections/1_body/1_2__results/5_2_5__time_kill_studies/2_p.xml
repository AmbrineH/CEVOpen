<p class="p">Interestingly, TTO associated with OXA was shown to lower the antibiotic MIC against MRSA, which was resistant to all antimicrobial beta-lactams. Evaluation of bactericidal and synergistic activity of TTO combined with OXA was therefore conducted at sub-inhibitory concentrations (

TTO and OXA alone at sub-inhibitory concentrations (0.25–0.5% and 1–2 μg/mL, respectively) were not able to reduce the bacterial amount, whereas the combinations of TTO + OXA at the same concentrations with the exception of 0.25% TTO + 1 μg/mL OXA, showed marked synergistic effects and bactericidal activity against MRSA, with absence of any bacterial growth at 24 h (
