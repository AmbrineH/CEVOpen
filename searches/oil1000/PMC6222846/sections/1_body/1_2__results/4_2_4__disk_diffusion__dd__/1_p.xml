<p class="p">The DD assay was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the liquid phase in comparison to the analysis by VP assay used for the evaluation of the volatile compound activity. DD experiments showed a higher potency of TTO against Gram-negative bacteria than

Regarding VP assays, the in-vitro effectiveness of TTO in VP was lower than that by DD analysis; nevertheless, TTO retained its activity against Gram-negatives, especially with regard to CR-Ab displaying 20 and 15 mm inhibition zone by means of DD and VP assays, respectively (
