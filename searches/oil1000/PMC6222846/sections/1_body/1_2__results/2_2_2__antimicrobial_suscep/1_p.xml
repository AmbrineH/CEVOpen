<p class="p">TTO minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBCs, respectively) were evaluated against a list of standard and clinical isolate strains of important microorganisms such as MSSA, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, MRSA, ESBL-CS-Kp, CR-Ab, and CR-Pa. AMK, CFZ, MEM, OXA, COL, RIF and VAN were used as references drugs (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02584-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). As expected, CR strains exhibited high MEM MIC/MBC values whereas both MSSA and MRSA showed sensitivity to VAN and RIF.
