<p class="p">Among the several chemical components contained in the TTO sample (
 <xref rid="molecules-23-02584-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), terpinen 4-ol, eucalyptol, α-pinene, and γ-terpinene were found to be the most abundant by the classical GC/MS analysis performed on the liquid EO (35.4%, 15.2%, 12.4%, 9.8%, respectively). A different scenario was instead observed by performing the EO VP analysis through headspace technique. A direct comparison of the two analyses indicated a marked increase in the percentage of α-pinene (22.5%) and almost 20% reduction in terpinen 4-ol (28.7%) in the VP.
