<p class="p">Tea tree oil (TTO) is produced by steam distillation of leaves and terminal branches of 
 <italic class="italic">Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> and is currently used in traditional medicine as a topical antiseptic and anti-inflammatory agent and widely formulated into many cosmetic and personal care products [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. TTO is mainly known for its antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], exerted by the inhibition of bacterial respiration and the disruption of the permeability barrier of microbial membrane structures, as well as by the induction of a leakage of potassium ions, both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]; in addition, it has been widely investigated in synergy with conventional antimicrobials, such as vancomycin [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and aminoglycosides for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and, recently, combined with different nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, little is known with regard to the activity of TTO against MDR and pan-drug resistant (PDR) Gram-negative strains both in liquid and VP as well as the potential interaction (i.e., restoring antibiotic sensitivity) between beta-lactams and TTO towards MRSA.
