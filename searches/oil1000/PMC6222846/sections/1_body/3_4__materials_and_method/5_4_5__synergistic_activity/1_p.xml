<p class="p">Checkerboard method was used to investigate the synergism of the following combinations: TTO + AMK/CFZ/OXA/VAN/RIF for MSSA/MRSA; TTO + AMK/MEM for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>; TTO + MEM/COL for CR-Ab; TTO + MEM/AMK/COL for CR-Pa; TTO + AMK/MEM/COL for ESBL-CS-Kp and CR-Kp. A 96-well microtitre plate containing TTO/antibiotic combinations at different concentrations (1–0.5–0.25% 
 <italic class="italic">v</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">v</italic> and 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 × MIC, respectively) was used to perform checkerboard synergy testing. Wells containing a final inoculum of ~5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under static conditions in MHB. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of each combination was defined as: ∑FIC: FICA + FICB = MICA + B/MICAalone + MICB + A/MICBalone. Synergism was defined as FICI ≤ 0.5 whereas FICI &gt; 0.5 but &lt;4 were considered as indifferent.
