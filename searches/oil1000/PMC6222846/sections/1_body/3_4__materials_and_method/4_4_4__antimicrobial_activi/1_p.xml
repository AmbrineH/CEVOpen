<p class="p">MIC and MBC of TTO, amikacin (AMK), cefazolin (CFZ), meropenem (MEM), oxacillin (OXA), colistin (COL), rifampin (RIF), and vancomicin (VAN) were determined by using the macro dilution broth method [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-23-02584" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of each antimicrobial agent and TTO were prepared in 2 mL Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) in borosilicate glass tubes and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic that completely inhibited visible growth whereas bactericidal activity was defined as ≥3-log10 CFU/ml reduction of the initial bacterial count after 24 h of incubation. The used bacterial inoculum was ~5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> CFU/mL.
