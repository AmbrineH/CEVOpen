<p class="p">Killing curves were performed in boro-silicate glass tubes in a final volume of 10 mL CAMHB which were further incubated at 37 °C. At 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h time points, 1 mL aliquots were sampled and washed with 0.9% saline solution in order to prevent the antibiotic carry-over effect. Ten-fold dilutions were then plated on Muller-Hinton agar and the number of CFUs was determined. Medium without antibiotics was used as growth control. Bactericidal activity was defined as ≥99.9% (i.e., ≥3-log10 CFU/mL) reduction of the initial bacterial count at each time point. Synergy was defined as a ≥100-fold decrease in CFU/mL between the combination and its most active constituent at the same concentration after 24 h, with the number of surviving organisms in the presence of the combination ≥100-fold CFU/mL below the starting inoculum. </p>
