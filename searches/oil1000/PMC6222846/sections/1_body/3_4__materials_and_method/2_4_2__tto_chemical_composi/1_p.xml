<p class="p">The GC/MS analysis was carried out with a GC-MS and GC-FID using a turbomass Clarus 500 GC-MS/GC-FID from Perkin Elmer instruments (Waltham, MA, USA). A Stabilwax fused-silica capillary column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm film thickness) was used with helium as carrier gas (1.0 mL/min). GC oven temperature was kept at 60 °C for 5 min and programmed to 220 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and kept constant at 220 °C for 30 min. Solvent delay 0–2 min and scan time 0.2 s. MS was taken at 70 eV. Mass range was from 30 to 350
