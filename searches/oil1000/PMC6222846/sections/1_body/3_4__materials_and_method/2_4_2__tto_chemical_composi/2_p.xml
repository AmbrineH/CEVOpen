<p class="p">To investigate TTO volatile component, a Perkin-Elmer Headspace (HS) Turbomatrix 40 autosampler connected to a Clarus 500 GC-MS was used for headspace analysis. To develop an optimal headspace procedure for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from TTO, essential parameters such as equilibration time and temperature were adjusted.</p>
