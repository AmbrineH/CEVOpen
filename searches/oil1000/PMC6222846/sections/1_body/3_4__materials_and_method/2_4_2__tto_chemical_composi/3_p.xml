<p class="p">The relative percentages for quantification of the components were calculated by electronic integration of the GC-FID peak areas. Identification of the constituents was performed based on MS library search (Nist MS Search Ver. 2.0 and Wiley 9th edition). Linear retention indices (LRI) of each compound were calculated using a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C8-C30, Ultrasci) injected directly into the GC injector with the same temperature program as reported above. Only chemical components with percentages higher that 0.1% were investigated (
