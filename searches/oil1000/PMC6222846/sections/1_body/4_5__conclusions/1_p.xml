<p class="p">In conclusion (a) for the first time a significant potency of TTO (alone and in combination) was demonstrated against a selection of clinically relevant MDR/PDR Gram-negative microorganisms; (b) the antibacterial evaluation of TTO was performed both in liquid and VP, making it reasonable to be used as a possible inhalatory for lung infections, especially those caused by CR-Ab; (c) the activity of TTO/OXA combination against MRSA at sub-inhibitory concentrations might be expression of a restored susceptibility to OXA induced by TTO, with obvious clinical implications.</p>
