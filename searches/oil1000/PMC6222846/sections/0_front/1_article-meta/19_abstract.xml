 <p class="p">Purpose: Herein, an extended investigation of Tea tree oil (TTO) against a number of multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms in liquid and vapor phases is reported. Methods: The activity of TTO was tested against methicillin-sensitive 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA), 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, and clinical strains of methicillin-resistant 
  <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta lactamases producer carbapenem-sensitive 
  <italic class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (ESBL-CS-Kp), carbapenem-resistant 
  <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> (CR-Kp), 
  <italic class="italic">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (CR-Ab), and 
  <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (CR-Pa). Minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBCs) and synergistic activity between TTO and different antimicrobials were determined. In the vapor assay (VP), TTO-impregnated discs were placed on the lid of a petri dish and incubated for 24 h at 37 Â°C. Results: TTO showed a potent bactericidal activity against all the tested microorganisms. TTO in combination with each reference antimicrobial showed a high level of synergism at sub-inhibitory concentrations, particularly with oxacillin (OXA) against MRSA. The VP assay showed high activity of TTO against CR-Ab. Conclusion: Evaluation of in-vitro activity clearly indicated TTO as a potential effective antimicrobial treatment either alone or in association with known drugs against MDR. Therefore, TTO could represent the basis for a possible role in non-conventional regimens against 
  <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and Gram-negative MDR. TTO in VP might represent a promising option for local therapy of pneumonia caused by CR-Ab.
