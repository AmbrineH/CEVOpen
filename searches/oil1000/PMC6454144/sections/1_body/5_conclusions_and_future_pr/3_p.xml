<p class="p">Inadequate reporting of experimental methodologies may hinder independent verification and validation of results among different laboratories and equipment units. It is therefore advisable to establish a set of recommended guidelines for conducting and reporting NTAP experiments which would help improve the reliability of future experimental data, thus facilitating process optimization for industrial implementation. Some suggestions on this regard are provided in
