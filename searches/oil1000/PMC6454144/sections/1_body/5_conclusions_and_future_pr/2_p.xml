<p class="p">Although the exact mechanism of microbial inactivation by NTAP is not completely known yet, the cellular envelopes, DNA and proteins are recognized as potential targets, and damages produced to them are the result of the simultaneous action of the different components and reactive species occurring in plasma when the microbial detoxifying capacity is overcome, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional macromolecules that compromise cellular viability. The multi-target nature of NTAP could justify the great antimicrobial effectiveness of NTAP in comparison with other technologies that affect a single component or cellular structure. The relative contribution of each individual damage to the total lethal effect of NTAP is unknown yet, since, on the one hand, the composition of plasmas may be very different depending on the conditions of production and, on the other hand, the magnitude of the damage could be in turn dependent on the type of microorganism and the time of treatment (Muranyi et al.,
