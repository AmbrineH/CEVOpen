<p class="p">However, the industrial implementation of NTAP with these aims still requires substantial research efforts, which should be especially focused at (i) assessing the impact that NTAP shows on the nutritional and sensory quality of treated foods in order to facilitate the design of preservation regimes capable of inhibiting pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms while maintaining food quality attributes; (ii) identifying the plasma components and reactive species responsible for the antimicrobial activity of NTAP, which will allow a better selection of processing conditions; (iii) confirming the lack of toxicity of the chemical species generated during NTAP treatments; (iv) developing combined preservation treatments, within a hurdles technology concept, where other inactivation approaches showing a synergic effect when applied together with NTAP will be used; (v) and designing fit-for-purpose equipment susceptible to be easily adopted in a processing line, being compact, energetically efficient, and cost-effective.</p>
