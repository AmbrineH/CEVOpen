<p class="p">At present, consumers demand safe foods which also meet other quality criteria that traditional food preservation methods do not meet, such as convenience, high nutritional and sensorial quality, long shelf life, freshness, additives-free status, environment-friendly processing and low production costs (Fernández et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Heat treatments have been widely used for many years to extend shelf life and enhance food safety and are generally well-accepted by consumers. However, they present certain drawbacks, such as the loss of nutrients and the considerable reduction in the organoleptic quality of some foods they cause (Jayasena et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). For this reason, a great deal of attention has been paid in recent years to the development of new preservation approaches, based on novel technologies, so-called “Emerging Food Preservation Technologies,” whose objective is to inactivate microorganisms and enzymes without appreciably altering their nutritional, organoleptic and functional characteristics (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). These novel technologies include high hydrostatic pressures, pulsed electric fields, high-intensity ultrasounds, pulsed light, oscillating magnetic fields and, more recently, non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP).
