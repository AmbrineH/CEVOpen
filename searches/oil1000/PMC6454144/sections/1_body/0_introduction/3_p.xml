<p class="p">In order to produce plasma it is necessary to supply energy to a gas to cause its ionization. Plasmas can be classified according to their temperature into two large groups: thermal plasmas and cold plasmas (Lieberman and Lichtenberg, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Thermal plasmas can reach temperatures of up to several thousand Celsius degrees and are used in applications where high temperatures are required, such as in casting processes in the metallurgical industry or in chemical synthesis processes (e.g., production of acetylene from natural gas). Cold plasmas, with temperatures close to ambient temperature, are on the contrary suitable for the treatment of heat sensitive materials.
