<p class="p">These cold or non-thermal plasmas (NTAP) are generated by the application of an electric or electromagnetic field to a gas. The field energy causes the free electrons to accelerate and ionizes the gas atoms and molecules, which release more free electrons that in turn provoke new ionizations. In addition, excited electrons produce molecular dissociations, with the formation of new atoms and free radicals, also able to excite atoms and molecules to higher energy levels. Excited atoms and molecules, when returning to the more stable state, emit excess energy in the form of broad-spectrum electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Consequently, the plasma is constituted basically by molecules and atoms in an excited state, positive and negative ions, free radicals, electrons, UV radiation and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, such as ozone, superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, atomic oxygen, nitric oxide or nitrogen dioxide. Interestingly, all these agents show antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, molds, yeasts, and even bacterial and fungal spores (Kl√§mpfl et al.,
