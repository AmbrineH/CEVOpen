<p class="p">The term Plasma is used in Physics and Chemistry to designate the state of an ionized gas. Plasma is considered the fourth state of Matter. Although solid, liquid and gaseous states are more common on Earth due to their temperature and pressure conditions, they are, in global terms, exceptional, whereas plasma is the predominant state across the universe. It is estimated that up to 99% of Matter is found in this state, e.g., in auroras, the ionosphere, the solar wind, the sun and other stars (Lackmann and Bandow,

In addition, it is also possible to artificially produce plasmas, and many of them are part of our daily lives (e.g., televisions or monitors with plasma screens, fluorescent tubes or neon lamps used in lighting and as indicators in equipment, etc.). They are also used for industrial purposes, e.g., to confer certain functional properties onto materials (paper, plastics, fabrics or electronic elements), to produce electrostatic precipitation of fine particles, to generate ozone, or as an active medium for chemical synthesis processes.
