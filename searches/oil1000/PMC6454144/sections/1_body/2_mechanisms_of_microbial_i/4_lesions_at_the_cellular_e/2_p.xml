<p class="p">Reactive species exert their oxidative effect especially on the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the cytoplasmic membrane (Laroussi and Leipold, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), which are very susceptible to lipid peroxidation phenomena. Lipid peroxidation can compromise cell viability by modifying membrane properties, decreasing its permeability and even its integrity (Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Hosseinzadeh Colagar et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction that begins with the attack of unsaturated fatty acids by reactive oxygen species (or any reactive species), which extract a hydrogen atom from a methylene group (-CH2), giving rise to the formation of a lipid radical (L
 <sup class="sup">*</sup>) which can react rapidly with an oxygen molecule to give a peroxyl radical (LOO
 <sup class="sup">*</sup>). These radicals can extract new hydrogen atoms from other lipids and become hydroperoxides (LOOH), which undergo chemical degradative phenomena to produce very toxic degradation compounds, such as alkoxy (LO
 <sup class="sup">*</sup>), peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals and reactive aldehydes, including malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal. In fact, malondialdehyde is commonly used as a biological marker of oxidative stress (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), and a linear correlation between the content of this compound in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, the time of exposure to NTAP and microbial viability has been described (Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Hosseinzadeh Colagar et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Yost and Joshi, 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). These intermediate reactive compounds also behave as secondary toxic messengers of the reactive species generated in the plasma, amplifying their lethal damage to the cell (Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Furthermore, many have greater stability than the plasma reactive species and, consequently, a much longer cytotoxic action, and can disseminate from the membrane toward more distant molecules, like DNA (Yost and Joshi, 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), where they exert their action by interacting with nucleotides, inducing important modifications and cross-links and making cell growth and DNA repair more difficult (del Rio et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Typhimurium, malondialdehyde has been shown to be capable of inducing base insertions, deletions and substitutions, thus potentially contributing to significant DNA alterations (Dobrynin et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). In addition, some of the aldehydes generated in the peroxidation process, including malondialdehyde, are capable of forming cross-links in the polypeptide chains of proteins, affecting the activity of enzymes and membrane-associated proteins. To sum up, NTAP causes an uncontrolled process of lipid peroxidation which results in (i) changes in the membrane chemical composition, ultrastructural organization and permeability, (ii) a decrease in membrane fluidity, and (iii) the inactivation of membrane-associated enzymes, thereby compromising cellular viability.
