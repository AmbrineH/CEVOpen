<p class="p">Damage to DNA is caused through the oxidation of bases. For example, oxidation of guanine generates 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (OHdG), a compound which is used as a marker of oxidative DNA damage (Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Yost and Joshi, 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The oxidation of DNA bases leads to a transversion (substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine or 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic>), which alters the bonds between DNA bases, causing changes in DNA conformation, and frequently leading to errors in the reading of the strand, mutagenesis and cell death. Some of the chemical species of plasma also react with deoxyribose carbons, breaking the N-glucosidic bond, thus generating apurinic or apyrimidine sites (abasic sites). All these changes may eventually lead to DNA strand ruptures (Hosseinzadeh Colagar et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ryu et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Yost and Joshi, 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Microorganisms can nevertheless respond to DNA damage inflicted by NTAP. Indeed, transcriptional studies using microarrays have demonstrated that up to 18 genes involved in the SOS response are overexpressed upon exposure to NTAP (Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Such overexpression is triggered when the level of accumulated damage is so high that microbial replication mechanisms are blocked. Similarly, Sharma et al. (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), studying the transcriptomic response of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> cells exposed for 2 min to an argon plasma, observed an intense overexpression of several genes encoding for polymerase enzymes involved in the repair of extremely damaged DNA (
 <italic class="italic">polB, dinB, umuC</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">umuD</italic>). In addition, these authors also detected an incomplete induction of some more specific DNA repair mechanisms, such as the nucleotide cleavage repair system, and concluded that plasma exerted massive damage at DNA level. The existence of significant damage to microbial DNA has also been corroborated using agarose gel electrophoresis techniques (Joshi et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Han et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Hosseinzadeh Colagar et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ryu et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). For instance, Joshi et al. (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) observed fragmentation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> DNA after NTAP treatment, which increased with increasing treatment times, and Hosseinzadeh Colagar et al. (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found that treatment times longer than 3 min resulted in a complete degradation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> genomic DNA. Similar results have been obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by Ryu et al. (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), who also found complete DNA fragmentation after exposure to plasma for up to 3 min, and by Muranyi et al. (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), who detected massive DNA damage in 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> vegetative cells and, to a lesser extent, in their sporulated forms.
