<p class="p">The influence of treatment medium composition on plasma effectiveness in liquid media has been scarcely studied, but some reports have shown that the presence of some salts, such as carbonates, phosphates and sodium chloride (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Ryu et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), reduce the efficacy of NTAP treatments, through reacting with the chemically active species or due to their buffering capacity. The presence of organic matter can also influence the effectiveness of NTAP. Indeed, Rowan et al. (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) observed a greater inactivation of various enteropathogenic microorganisms in poultry washing water than in distilled water, which was attributed to the formation of nitric acid and carbonic acid from fat and proteins present in the medium. On the other hand, the inactivation of molds and yeasts in complex media has been shown to be much less effective than in a saline solution or water (Ryu et al.,
