<p class="p">For liquids, only those plasma-generated reactive species with a relatively long life, such as ozone, atomic oxygen, nitric oxide or hydrogen peroxide, would have the capacity to diffuse through the medium and interact with microbial cells (Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, NTAP has been shown to be very effective in liquid media (Montenegro et al., 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Surowsky et al., 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), which has been attributed to the generation of new secondary reactive species through the interaction of the chemical species of plasma with each other or with water or other molecules present in the liquid or gaseous phase of the medium. For example, the coexistence of ozone and hydrogen peroxide in water results in highly reactive species such as hydroperoxides and hydroxyl radicals. In addition, atomic oxygen, upon reaction with water, can generate hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen (Surowsky et al., 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Takamatsu et al., 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), and the interaction of nitric oxide and superoxide produces peroxynitrite, a highly reactive compound that can readily diffuse through cell membranes (Ercan et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
