<p class="p">The higher NTAP resistance exhibited by yeasts and molds in comparison to vegetative bacterial cells could be due to differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in cellular structure and molecular composition. On the one hand, the fungal genome is protected by the nuclear membrane, which constitutes an additional diffusion barrier that would contribute to increase the cell resistance to DNA damaging agents. On the other hand, the fungal cell wall is very thick and consists of rigid layers of polysaccharides, which would provide further protection to the cell (Kl√§mpfl et al.,
