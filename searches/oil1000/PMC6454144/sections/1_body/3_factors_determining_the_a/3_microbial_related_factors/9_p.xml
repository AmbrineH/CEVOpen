<p class="p">It is worth noting that NTAP treatments have been shown to be capable of inactivating different bacteria (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus, E. faecium, L. monocytogenes, E. coli</italic> O157:H7, 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>) in the form of biofilms (Jahid et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Flynn et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). It is well-known that cells within biofilms exhibit increased resistance to various disinfectant agents commonly used in the food industry (Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Similarly, cells in planktonic state show a higher sensitiveness toward NTAP than cells within biofilms. For instance, Jahid et al. (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported for 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic> that a treatment with an oxygen plasma for 15 s caused a 7 log reduction in planktonic cells, whereas only 3 log reductions were obtained for cells forming a biofilm, even when the treatment time was prolonged for up to 5 min. The increased NTAP resistance of cells within biofilms has been attributed to the protective effect exerted by the biofilm's extracellular matrix, constituted mainly by polymeric substances, including polysaccharides, phospholipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and teicoic acids (Shi and Zhu, 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), which represents a physical barrier hindering the penetration of the chemical reactive species occurring in plasma, which would then require longer treatment times to exert their antimicrobial action (Vleugels et al., 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>).
