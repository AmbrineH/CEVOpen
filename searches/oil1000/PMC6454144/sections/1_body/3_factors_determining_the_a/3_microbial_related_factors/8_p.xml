<p class="p">It is well-known that the cellular physiological state markedly determines microbial resistance to different inactivation treatments. In fact, bacterial cells harvested during exponential growth phase are known to be more sensitive against heat, pulsed electric fields and high hydrostatic pressures than cells obtained in the stationary phase of growth (Alvarez et al.,

 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). However, based on the results available in the literature, the microbial physiological state exerts little or no influence at all on microbial resistance against NTAP. Thus, no significant differences in D-values were found among
