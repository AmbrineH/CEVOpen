<p class="p">Microbial resistance to various inactivation treatments is largely determined by growth conditions, especially temperature and pH (Alvarez-Ordóñez et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Álvarez-Ordóñez et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Alvarez-Ordóñez et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, little attention has been paid so far to the impact of such environmental growth conditions on the effectiveness of NTAP treatments. Very few studies have assessed the effect of growth temperature on NTAP resistance. There exists some data for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Typhimurium, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Enteritidis, 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. innocua</italic>, grown in the range 10–45°C (Fernández et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Calvo et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), and for 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic>, grown at temperatures between 4 and 30°C (Jahid et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). From these studies it can be concluded that no significant differences in NTAP resistance occur at growth temperatures close to the optimum growth temperature (20 to 45°C), while at temperatures below 20°C a minor sensitization of cells to plasma occurred. On the other hand, in the particular case of 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic> cells forming biofilms, resistance to NTAP exponentially increased with increasing growth temperatures, with times required to reduce the population in 5 log cycles being 1.84 min at 4°C and 25.33 min at 30°C (Jahid et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
