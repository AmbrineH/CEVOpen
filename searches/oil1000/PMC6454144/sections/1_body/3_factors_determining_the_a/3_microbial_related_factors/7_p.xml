<p class="p">Intraspecific variability in NTAP resistance may also exist. Indeed, Galvin et al. (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and Burts et al. (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) have reported differences of around 1 log cycle of inactivation among 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strains exposed either to helium-based or air-based plasmas. Similar results have been described by Niemira (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) for a group of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> O157:H7 strains exposed to air plasmas.
