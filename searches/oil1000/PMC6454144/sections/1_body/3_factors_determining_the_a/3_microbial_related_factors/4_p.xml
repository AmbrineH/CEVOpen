<p class="p">The higher NTAP resistance exhibited by bacterial spores may be due to the low water content and the high concentration of dipicolinic acid in the spore core, the low permeability of the spore inner membrane, the very robust spore coat, which represents a physical barrier to external agents, the special conformation of the spore DNA, which is saturated by a group of soluble acid proteins (SASP), the presence of detoxifying enzymes in the spore cortex, or the absence of metabolic activity within the spore, which limits the activity of plasma-generated components (Henriques and Moran, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). In a recent study by Reineke et al. (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) analyzing two 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> mutant strains, unable to synthesize dipicolinic acid during sporulation and two of the major SASPs, respectively, it was reported that only this latter strain was more sensitive to NTAP than the wild type strain, what suggested that DNA stabilization through SASPs may be responsible, at least in part, for the increased resistance of bacterial spores against NTAP.
