<p class="p">In relation to the influence of growth pH, our research team (Calvo et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) has recently demonstrated that the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Typhimurium, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Enteritidis and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in media acidified with different acids (acetic, ascorbic, citric, lactic, malic, and hydrochloric) at low pH conditions (pH 6.5, 5.4 or 4.5) did not significantly influence the antimicrobial effectiveness of NTAP treatments. The short-term exposure of these microorganisms to acid, cold or heat stress shocks prior to NTAP treatments did no modify their resistance either. Since cross-resistance adaptive responses did not take place, these findings allowed us to conclude that NTAP may be a first-choice technology to be included into food processing schemes following a hurdles technology approach in combination with acidification, mild heating or refrigeration.
