<p class="p">Several authors have attempted to explain the loss of antimicrobial efficacy of NTAP on substrates with high microbial loads. Fernández et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) suggested that with high microbial loads the abundance of reactive species per cell would not be sufficient to cause their death. Even, these reactive species would react with already inactivated microorganisms or with their cellular components (e.g., proteins), which could act as sequestering agents (Kamgang-Youbi et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), thus protecting the remaining living cells. In this regard, Fernández et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) found that the addition of heat-inactivated cells significantly reduced NTAP effectiveness against 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Typhimurium. In addition, when high microbial loads are present, microorganisms are arranged in a stacked structure, in the form of multiple layers, with the upper microbial layers, even if already inactivated, constituting a physical barrier to the penetration of plasma, therefore protecting those microorganisms located in the inner layers. This distribution of microorganisms in layers has been observed through electron microscopy for 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic> spores (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), as well as through fluorescence microscopy for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Typhimurium (Fernández et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, it should be taken into account that in all the studies mentioned above, contamination levels and microbial loads were much higher than those expected in naturally contaminated food.
