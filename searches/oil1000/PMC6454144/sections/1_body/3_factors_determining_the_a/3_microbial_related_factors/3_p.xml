<p class="p">Some studies, in particular, provide interesting insights into the inter-kingdom and inter-species variability in NTAP resistance. Kl√§mpfl et al. (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) evaluated the effectiveness of an air plasma for the inactivation of vegetative cells of 15 bacterial species, including 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli. P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, E. faecalis, B. cereus, B. pumilus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. difficile</italic>, one yeast species (
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>), and spores of four bacterial species (
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis, B. pumilus, B. atrophaeus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. stearothermophilus</italic>). They observed that after 30 s of NTAP treatment, between 4 and 6 log reductions were achieved for vegetative cells, while after a 1 min exposure under the same working conditions, from 1 (
 <italic class="italic">G. stearothermophilus</italic>) to 4 (
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>) log reductions were attained for bacterial spores. Lee et al. (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), using a plasma obtained from a mixture of helium and oxygen, also reported a higher sensitivity to NTAP for vegetative cells than for yeasts and bacterial spores, with D values of 0.3 min for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, 2 min for 
 <italic class="italic">S. cerevisae</italic>, and 14 min for 
 <italic class="italic">B subtilis</italic> spores. Similarly, Takamatsu et al. (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found that treatments of around 1 min with a nitrogen-based plasma were required in order to achieve 6 log cycles of inactivation for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>, while 5 and 15 min were required to achieve the same inactivation levels for 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus</italic> spores, respectively. Moreover, Tseng et al. (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) described D values of 0.50 min for vegetative cells of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, while D values obtained for bacterial spores of species belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus, Geobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis, G. stearothermophilus, C. sporogenes, C. perfringens, C. difficile</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">C. botulinum</italic> Type A and type B) ranged between 2.66 (
 <italic class="italic">C. perfringens</italic>) and 8.04 (
 <italic class="italic">C. botulinum</italic> type A) min. Interestingly, spores of 
 <italic class="italic">G. stearothermophilus</italic>, generally used as biological indicators of heat sterilization treatments given their extreme thermoresistance, showed a similar NTAP resistance to that of spores of 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, a mesophilic microorganism, suggesting that mechanisms of inactivation by heat and plasma differ, at least to a certain extent. Similar observations were also made by van Bokhorst-van de Veen et al. (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), who hardly found differences in NTAP resistance among spores of 
 <italic class="italic">B. cereus, G. stearothermophilus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. atrophaeus</italic>, obtaining between 3.7 and 4.9 log reductions after a 20 min treatment with a nitrogen-based plasma, while identified large inter-species variations in spore resistance to heat, UV light and chemical oxidants (hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite).
