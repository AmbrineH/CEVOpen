<p class="p">With processing times described in the literature ranging from a few seconds up to several minutes, it is well-known that microbial inactivation increases with processing time, although not in all cases exponentially. Thus, a wide variety of inactivation kinetics are observed in the published data, where it is frequent to find both linear, concave-upward (tailing) and concave-downward (shoulders) kinetics (Lee et al.,
