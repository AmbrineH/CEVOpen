<p class="p">NTAP effectiveness can also depend on whether treatments are carried out directly or indirectly. In direct treatments, the product is physically located in the field where plasma is generated, and, therefore, it is in intimate contact with all the photons and chemical species produced. In contrast, in indirect treatments plasma is produced at some distance from the product, and is usually displaced toward it, using a rapid flow of the feed gas. In principle, one would expect that indirect treatments would be less effective in microbial inactivation. Patil et al. (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) demonstrated that the direct exposure of 
 <italic class="italic">B. atrophaeus</italic> spores to plasmas generated with gases of different composition (air; a mixture of nitrogen [90%] and oxygen [10%]; a mixture of oxygen [65%], CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> [30%], and nitrogen [5%]) caused the inactivation of at least 6 log cycles, whereas for indirect exposures inactivation rates ranged from 2.1 to 6.3 log units, depending on the type of gas used. Nevertheless, other authors have obtained conflicting results. Thus, Han et al. (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found that indirect treatments were more effective against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> than direct treatments, and suggested that this fact could be due to the recombination of reactive radicals with a short life before reaching the microorganisms in indirect treatments, giving rise to new chemical species with strong bactericidal effects. However, there are also some authors (Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015a</xref>) who did not detect differences in effectiveness between direct and indirect treatments when treating 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes, E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> biofilms.
