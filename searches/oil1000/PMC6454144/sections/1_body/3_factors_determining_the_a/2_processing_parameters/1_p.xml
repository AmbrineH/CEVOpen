<p class="p">NTAP may be obtained through electrical discharges, which may be accomplished by using very diverse systems, e.g., corona discharge, micro hollow cathode discharge, atmospheric pressure plasma jet, gliding arc discharge, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), radiofrequency (rf) and microwaves. In any case, electrical discharges are initiated and sustained through electron collision processes under the action of specific electric or electromagnetic fields. Among all the existing plasma sources, DBD and plasma jets are the most widely explored configurations in food research, due to their easiness of construction and adoption. Indeed, there are some commercially available DBD and plasma jet configurations. Nevertheless, regardless of the equipment used, the molecular composition of plasma will depend on the energy supplied, which in turn is determined by voltage, power and excitation frequency, and even on the composition and flow rate of the working gas, with these parameters being very variable among different NTAP units, which makes it very difficult to carry out direct comparisons among research studies executed employing different equipment and NTAP processing conditions. However, it is possible to draw some general conclusions on how some processing parameters affect the level of microbial inactivation achieved through NTAP treatments.</p>
