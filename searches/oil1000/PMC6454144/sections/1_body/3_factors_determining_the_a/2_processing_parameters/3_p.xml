<p class="p">Voltage (difference of potential between two points per unit of charge, expressed in Volts), power (electrical energy consumed per unit of time, expressed in Watts) and frequency (number of cycles per second, expressed in Hertz) have a great effect on the antimicrobial effectiveness of NTAP, as they are known to determine the input energy and, consequently, the chemical reactive species generated and their concentration. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that an increase in voltage increases microbial inactivation of both vegetative cells and bacterial spores (

However, some technological constraints, including high costs, and potential negative impacts on food quality, due to an excessive temperature rise, represent a limit toward the use of extreme processing conditions in industrial practice (Kim et al.,
