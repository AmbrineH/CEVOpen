<p class="p">Gas flow rate also seems to influence the effectiveness of NTAP treatments (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Lai et al. (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) reported a steady increase in 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli, S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. alcaligenes</italic> inactivation when air flow rates increased from 2 to 7 meters/s, linked to a linear rise in the concentration of negative ions in the generated plasma. Results from our research group have demonstrated that the effect of gas flow rate on 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. innocua</italic> inactivation through NTAP depended on the type of gas used to generate plasma. Indeed, increases in flow rate from 5 to 10 L/min caused an acceleration of bacterial inactivation when air was used, while an additional increase of gas flow from 10 to 15 L/min had a minor impact on microbial inactivation. On the other hand, gas flow rate hardly affected NTAP treatment efficiency when nitrogen was used to generate plasma (Calvo et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). A similar behavior was also observed for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Enteritidis and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Typhimurium (Calvo et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). In contrast, Edelblute et al. (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found that an increase in air flow rate from 5 to 10 liters per minute was accompanied by a loss of efficacy of NTAP for the inactivation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. epidermidis</italic>, and attributed this effect to a reduction in ozone and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. Moreover, Miao and Jierong (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), using oxygen as working gas, suggested the existence of an optimal flow rate for the inactivation of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, reporting that, once this optimal flow rate is surpassed, the lethal effect achieved is reduced. According to these authors, at low flow rates, the number of reactive species, mainly constituted by oxygen radicals, is lower than at high flow rates, but they have a higher average energy and, therefore, the likelihood of each one colliding with microbial cells increases and, consequently, also their antimicrobial effectiveness. However, at higher flow rates the number of reactive species will be higher, but they will have a lower average energy, and their antimicrobial action would be comparatively lower.
