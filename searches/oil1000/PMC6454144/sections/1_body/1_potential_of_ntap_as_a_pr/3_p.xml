<p class="p">This set of advantages has led in recent years to explore the use of NTAP for food preservation, and there are already numerous studies, focused on characterizing its antimicrobial effectiveness and on deciphering the inactivation mechanisms involved. Nevertheless, a great research effort is still necessary to accomplish its successful implementation at industrial level as a safe and effective alternative to traditional preservation methods, with the main challenges arising from the difficulty in interpreting the data obtained by different research groups which use very diverse equipment and operating conditions, resulting in very different plasmas in terms of properties and, consequently, with very different antimicrobial effectiveness. However, some general conclusions can be drawn on various aspects related to the mechanisms of microbial inactivation by NTAP and the factors that determine its lethal efficacy, which will be discussed in the following sections of this review article.</p>
