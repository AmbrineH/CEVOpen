<p class="p">The possibility of using plasma as a surface decontamination technology was first pointed out in the late 60's in an American patent (Menashi, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1968</xref>). However, NTAP was not implemented yet in the food industry at that point, since cold plasmas could only be obtained under vacuum and at small-scale conditions, which was expensive and not applicable in industrial settings (Lackmann and Bandow, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Nonetheless, the technological advances experienced at the late 90's in relation to the sources of plasma generation allowed the development of equipment capable of generating plasmas at atmospheric pressure, thus avoiding the need for vacuum cameras and pumps and facilitating continuous treatments with relatively simple and inexpensive equipment.
