<p class="p">NTAP offers very important advantages for food industries, which makes it a very promising novel food preservation technology. Firstly, it allows short processing times. Indeed, it has been described that very short treatment times (between a few seconds and 2 min) can cause more than 5 log reductions for different microorganisms, including pathogens such as

 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, and even sporulated microorganisms such as 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium botulinum</italic> (Deng et al.,

 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Jayasena et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), which prevents their subsequent recontamination. Finally, its non-toxic nature and the reduced consumption of water and chemical agents result in a significant reduction of effluents, which is beneficial not only from an economic but also from an environmental point of view.
