<p class="p">As already mentioned, the interaction of plasma with water results in the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, including nitrates and nitrites (Oehmigen et al., 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), reaching concentrations of up to 1,050 ppm (Hao et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The generation of nitrites during plasma treatment may raise a flag since use of nitrites in food is restricted, with maximum allowed concentrations, due to their potential toxicological effects. However, Jung et al. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) manufactured frankfurters by replacing the nitrites of the curing salts by plasma-treated water and did not detect significant differences in their microbiological or organoleptic quality during 28 days of storage at refrigeration. Interestingly, the residual nitrite content was 30% lower in sausages processed with plasma-treated water. Similar results have been also obtained by directly treating the meat butter with NTAP at different stages of the sausage making process, and a patent for NTAP as a system to eliminate nitrites in meat products has been recently filed (Lim et al.,
