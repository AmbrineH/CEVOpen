<p class="p">Finally, NTAP has been also evaluated as a methodology capable of inducing modifications in the functional properties of proteins. Misra et al. (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) showed that the secondary structure of gluten became more stable when wheat flour had been treated with an air plasma, and observed significant changes in the rheological properties of the doughs obtained. These changes, both in viscosity and elasticity, depended on the treatment conditions, applied voltage and exposure time. Thus, NTAP can be used as an innovative strategy in order to modulate the functionality of wheat flour during processing of bread, pasta, noodles, cookies, and others.
