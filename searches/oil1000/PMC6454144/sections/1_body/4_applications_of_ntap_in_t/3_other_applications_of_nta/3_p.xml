<p class="p">NTAP can be used to modify the surface properties of various materials, such as paper, polymers or electronic equipment, to confer them certain functional properties of interest. The idea of using this technology to achieve surface modifications in foods is innovative. NTAP has been used to modulate hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of oil coatings on cookies, in order to improve palatability and appearance (Misra et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). These authors demonstrated that NTAP increased surface hydrophobicity, resulting in a greater extension of the incorporated oil and in a more accurate infiltration of oil, without affecting the color, odor and appearance of cookies. Thus, it allowed the preservation of the functionality of the sprayed oil, also decreasing the amount of oil required, which is interesting from a nutritional and economic point of view. A modification of surface properties after NTAP treatments has also been observed for basmati rice (Thirumdas et al., 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this case, NTAP increased the hydrophilicity and water absorption rate of the cereal, and decreased the cooking time, from 20 to 13 min. Electron microscopy images of the treated rice grains revealed the presence of cracks and depressions on their surface, which probably provide routes for faster absorption of water. Although this experiment was carried out under vacuum conditions, which does not allow a direct extrapolation of the results, similar results are expected at atmospheric pressure conditions. Similarly, NTAP is currently being also proposed as a promising technology for the physico-chemical modification of processing surfaces, such as those of food-contact materials, in a way to prevent microbial adhesion and formation of biofilms, therefore limiting episodes of food cross-contamination with persistent microorganisms colonizing food processing environments. These surface modification techniques are sometimes focused at changing electronegativity, hydrophobicity or morphology/topography of surfaces (Bazaka et al.,
