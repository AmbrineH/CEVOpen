<p class="p">Another potential application of NTAP in the food industry is the decontamination of food processing surfaces and equipment. In fact, a novel plasma system has been designed to decontaminate slicers, in which the cutting blade of the equipment constitutes one of the electrodes of the dielectric discharge system (Leipold et al.,
