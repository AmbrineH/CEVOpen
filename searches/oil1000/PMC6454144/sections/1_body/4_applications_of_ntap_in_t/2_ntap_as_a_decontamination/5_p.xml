<p class="p">NTAP can even be used for the decontamination of food once packaged, using dielectric barrier discharge equipment (Fröhling et al.,

 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Jayasena et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The reactive species generated in this case would simultaneously decontaminate both the packaging material and the food itself. Moreover, once the treatment concludes, the plasma species recombine, the atmosphere returns to its initial composition, and recontamination of the end product after NTAP treatment is thus avoided. The use of NTAP for the decontamination of food once packaged, has been successfully studied in cherry tomatoes, strawberries, bresaola and pork and beef meat by several research groups (Fröhling et al.,
