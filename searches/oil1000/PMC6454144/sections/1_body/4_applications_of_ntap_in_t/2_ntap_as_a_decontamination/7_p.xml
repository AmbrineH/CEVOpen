<p class="p">Recently, several authors have described the fact that water treated by NTAP, so-called plasma-activated water (PAW), has relevant antimicrobial activity, which persist over a long period of time (Kamgang-Youbi et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Ercan et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This offers new possibilities for decontamination of both surfaces and food, through the treatment of water by NTAP, which will be then used for decontamination purposes. This approach may be a promising alternative to the chemical agents currently used for the sanitation of surfaces, equipment and minimally processed vegetables. In fact, the potential of plasma-activated water has recently been revealed for the decontamination of strawberries (Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and mushrooms (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Indeed, a bactericidal effect similar to that obtained using sodium hypochlorite solutions (Issa-Zacharia et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), with no changes in color or firmness, was observed for strawberries treated with plasma-activated water, with log reductions for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ranging from 1.7 to 2.3 log depending on the exposure time (Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Log reductions achieved following a similar approach for treated mushrooms were between 1.5 and 0.7 log after a week of storage, and mushrooms maintained their initial quality attributes (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
