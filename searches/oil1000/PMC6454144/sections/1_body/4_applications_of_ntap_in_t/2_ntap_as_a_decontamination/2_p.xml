<p class="p">In relation to surface decontamination of foods, several studies have shown the potential of NTAP to improve the microbiological quality of a wide range of solid foods, including strawberries, tomatoes, chicken breast filets, ham, cheese slices, carrots, melon, or lettuce, and liquid foods, such as milk, apple and orange juices, and coconut liquid endosperm (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Although microbial inactivation rates obtained widely vary among studies, surfaces and microbial species tested, promising results have been reported. For example, with 2 min treatments, 4 to 8 logarithmic reductions were obtained for 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic> in tomatoes, cooked chicken breast filets and ham, cooked egg white and egg yolk, and cheese slices (Song et al., 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012b</xref>; Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), and 4.5 log units for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> in carrots (Baier et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>a). Even treatments as short as 10 and 15 s have been able to reduce the population of 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic> in lettuce in 5 log cycles (Jahid et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) and that of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. Typhimurium in tomatoes in 6 log units (Ziuzina et al., 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, most studies have not evaluated the impact of NTAP treatments on the nutritional and sensory properties of such foods, despite the fact that plasma-generated reactive species could lead to organoleptic changes in the end product. Moreover, information available in the literature is very variable, with some authors identifying minor changes in color, texture, appearance, taste or aroma of foods, while others have reported important modifications in sensory attributes after NTAP treatment (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The observed discrepancies are probably due to the variability in equipment, plasma generation conditions or type of food used in validation studies. Indeed, several authors have shown how these factors influence the maintenance of food sensory attributes. For example, the application of similar NTAP treatments significantly modified the color of carrots (Baier et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and the taste of cooked egg yolk (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012b</xref>), but did not affect these quality attributes in apples and cooked egg white, respectively. Moreover, NTAP treatments using helium as working gas caused changes in pork loin color, whereas this quality attribute was not modified in treatments using a mixture of helium and oxygen (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Baier et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) also reported changes in leaf lettuce color after a NTAP treatment, which only occurred when the distance between food and plasma generation source was low (5 mm). Furthermore, Rød et al. (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) described that an increase in potency, treatment time and storage time was accompanied by an increased lipid oxidation and rancidity of bresaola. Similarly, a NTAP treatment of 5–10 min has been shown to induce lipid oxidation in cheese samples (Yong et al., 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015b</xref>). However, no significant changes in the fatty acid composition of beef jerky were detected after exposure to plasma for 5 min (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
