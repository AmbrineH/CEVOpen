<p class="p">NTAP can be also used for the decontamination of food packaging materials. Currently, the most widely used methods with this aim are based on the employment of dry or wet heat or chemical agents, such as peracetic acid or hydrogen peroxide, which can be applied at relatively high temperatures, ranging from 65 to 80°C, to increase their effectiveness. However, most polymers used as packaging materials do not withstand high temperatures. In addition, some chemical agents also present other drawbacks, such as their difficult handling, maximum limits allowed and the possible generation of toxic waste substances. NTAP is an attractive alternative to chemical decontamination agents, due to its effectiveness as a decontamination technique which successfully inactivates microorganisms, including bacterial and fungal spores, on abiotic surfaces (Muranyi et al.,
