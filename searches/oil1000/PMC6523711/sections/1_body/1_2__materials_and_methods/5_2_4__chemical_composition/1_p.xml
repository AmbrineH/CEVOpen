<p class="p">The IPM alone, five experimental diets, and freeze-dried feces were ground. Fish whole-body samples from each tank were minced, mixed, and a representative sample was freeze-dried and homogenized. These ground/homogenized samples were then analyzed according to methodologies described by AOAC [
 <xref rid="B21-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The DM content was determined after drying samples at 105 °C for 24 h and ash content was determined by combustion at 550 °C for 12 h. Crude protein content (N × 6.25) was determined by the flash combustion technique followed by gas chromatographic separation and thermal conductivity detection on an FP 428 elemental analyzer (LECO Corp., Saint Joseph, MI, USA). Fat content was determined by dichloromethane extraction on a Soxhlet apparatus. Total phosphorus was measured according to the ISO 6491:1998 [

Gross energy was determined in an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (IKA-Werke GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Staufen, Germany). Yttrium oxide in feeds and feces was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) according to the methodology described by Reis et al. 2008 [
