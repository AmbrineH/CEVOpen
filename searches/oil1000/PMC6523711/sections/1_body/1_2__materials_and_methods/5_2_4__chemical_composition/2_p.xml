<p class="p">Total amino acids in the IPM alone and experimental diets were hydrolyzed (6 M HCl at 116 Â°C over 22 h in nitrogen-flushed glass vials) and then pre-column derivatized with the AccQ Fluor Reagent (6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate) using the AccQ Tag method (both Waters, Milford, MA, USA) [

Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was then performed in a reversed-phase amino acid analysis system (Waters) using norvaline as the internal standard. Tryptophan was not determined because it is partially destroyed by acid hydrolysis. The resultant peaks were analyzed with EMPOWER software (Waters).
