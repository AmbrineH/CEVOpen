<p class="p">A fishmeal-based control diet (CTRL) comprising 25% FM, 8% of squid meal and krill meal, soy protein concentrate, wheat gluten, and corn gluten was formulated with practical ingredients to fulfill the known nutritional requirements of rainbow trout (
 <italic class="italic">O. mykiss</italic>) juveniles. Based on this formulation, four test diets (IPM5, IPM7.5, IPM15, and IPM25) were formulated (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00187-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), in which FM was replaced at 20%, 30%, 60%, and 100%, respectively, by the yellow mealworm protein meal (the IPM tested here) obtained by processing the larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> reared on complete plant by-products at Ynsect (Dole, France). Proximate composition, and the amino acid and fatty acid profiles of the yellow mealworm protein meal are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-animals-09-00187" class="xref">Table S1</xref>. Squid and krill meal levels were maintained constant in all diets to guarantee high palatability. Test diets required minor adjustments on their formulations to maintain isonitrogenous [crude protein, 48.5% dry matter (DM)], isolipidic (22.7% DM), and isoenergetic (gross energy, 23.2 MJ/kg DM) conditions. Methionine and monocalcium phosphate supplementation were adjusted in test diets to match that of the CTRL diet.
