<p class="p">All powder ingredients were mixed at SPAROS (Olhão, Portugal) according to the target formulation in a 500-L double-helix mixer (TGC Extrusion, Roullet-Saint-Estèphe, France) and ground (&lt;400 µm) in a SH1 micropulverizer (Hosokawa-Alpine, Augsburg, Germany). Diet pellets (1.2 and 2.0 mm) were then manufactured by extrusion and dried in a DR100 vibrating fluid bed dryer (TGC Extrusion). After cooling, oils were added using the PG-10VCLAB vacuum coating device (Dinnissen, Sevenum, The Netherlands). Throughout the trial, experimental feeds were stored in a cool and aerated chamber at room temperature. Samples of each diet were taken for detailed analyses of amino acid and fatty acid profiles (
