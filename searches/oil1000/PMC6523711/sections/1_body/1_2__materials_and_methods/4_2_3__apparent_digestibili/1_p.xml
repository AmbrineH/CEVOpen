<p class="p">At the end of the growth performance trial, 12 fish (body weight: ca. 45 g) from each tank were used to determine the apparent digestibility of dry matter, protein, fat, energy, and phosphorus, following the indirect method with identical diets containing yttrium oxide (Y

 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, 200 mg/kg) as the inert tracer. Fish were stocked in 60-L cylindro-conical tanks with flow-through (3.7 L/min) freshwater at 14 °C and dissolved oxygen levels above 6.4 mg/L, and acclimated for 10 days to rearing conditions and experimental diets. After this period, fish were hand-fed in slight excess daily (at 10.00). Upon a thorough cleaning of the rearing tanks to remove any feed residues, feces were collected daily for the following eight days, using the continuous outlet water filtration system (Choubert-INRA system), and kept at −20 °C. Pooled feces from the fish within each tank were freeze-dried before analysis. Each dietary treatment was tested in triplicate.
