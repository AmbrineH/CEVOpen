<p class="p">Triplicate groups of 35 juvenile rainbow trout with a mean initial body weight (IBW) of 5.01 ± 0.1 g were fed one of the five experimental diets during 90 days. Fish were grown in 250-L fiberglass circular tanks (initial stocking density of 0.7 kg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) supplied with flow-through freshwater at 14.1 ± 0.3 °C and dissolved oxygen levels above 7.4 mg/L, under natural photoperiod changes from May to July. Fish were hand-fed to apparent satiety two or three times per day (at 9.00, 14.00, and 18.00 on weekdays; at 10.00 and 16.00 on weekends). Distributed feed was quantified throughout the trial. Anesthetized fish were individually weighed at the start and at the end of the trial. At the beginning of the trial, 15 fish from the same initial stock were sampled and stored at −20 °C for subsequent whole-body composition analysis. At the end of the trial, six fish from each tank were sampled for the same purpose.
