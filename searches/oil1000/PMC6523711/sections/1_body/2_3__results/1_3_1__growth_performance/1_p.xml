 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 65.959, df = 14). This increase was dose-dependent, with a moderate increase for IPM5, intermediate increase for IPM7.5 and IPM15, and highest increase for IPM25. The SGR was lowest in fish fed the CTRL diet, while those fed diets containing IPM showed significantly higher SGR values (
