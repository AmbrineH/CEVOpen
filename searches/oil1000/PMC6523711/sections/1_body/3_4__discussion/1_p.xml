<p class="p">The replacement of FM with IPM has been previously assessed for rainbow trout. Particularly, Belforti et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] used a commercial full-fat insect meal from 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> larvae, whereas Renna et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] used a partially defatted black soldier fly (
 <italic class="italic">Hermetia illucens</italic>) larvae meal. Both studies evidenced that IPM could be used to replace FM in rainbow trout diets. Moreover, both studies identified a poor lipid profile of fish fed IPM, which could be associated with the poor fatty acid profile of the tested ingredients [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. To our best knowledge, the present study is the first to address the use of fully defatted IPM to partially or fully replace FM in rainbow trout diet.
