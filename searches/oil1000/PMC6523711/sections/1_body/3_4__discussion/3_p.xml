 <xref rid="B31-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], there were no differences in the body composition of rainbow trout fed with the five experimental diets (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00187-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). This result supports the partial or full replacement of FM with IPM without adversely affecting moisture, protein, fat, ash, and phosphorus contents of rainbow trout. This is a notable achievement for the future application of this IPM in rainbow trout aquafeeds, as previous studies have shown notable changes in fish whole-body or fillet quality with the inclusion of insect meal in fish diets. For instance, the whole-body fat composition of African catfish was notably altered when a diet with a low level of insect meal (8%) was used [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. European sea bass showed no whole-body composition changes at 25% insect meal dietary inclusion, but at 50% inclusion level significant changes were observed in ash content. It is possible that the positive results observed for juvenile rainbow trout are associated with the use of defatted IPM and with the significant increases in the retention of protein, phosphorus, and energy in IPM diets (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00187-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The similar and relatively high ADC of the various nutrients and energy observed for rainbow trout fed IPM diets (
 <xref rid="animals-09-00187-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>) suggest that the IPM used in the present study is well digested by rainbow trout, which might contribute to the positive whole-body composition, nutrient retention, and growth performance results, as observed in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The similar ADC results among experimental diets and the amino acid and fatty acid compositions of the IPM diets tested here also support the highly efficient metabolic utilization of the nutrients observed here.
