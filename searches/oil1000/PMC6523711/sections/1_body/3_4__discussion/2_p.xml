<p class="p">The present results show that replacement of FM with fully defatted IPM improves growth performance to the highest range observed for juvenile rainbow trout [

 <xref rid="B30-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. For example, SGR varied between 2.4%/day and 2.7%/day, which is almost twice the SGR observed for rainbow trout fed a fully-fat 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> insect meal, regardless of the replacement level [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], and also higher than the results observed with black soldier fly insect meal, which averaged 1.41% [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In the present study, FCR varied between 0.79 and 0.93 among treatments, indicating the good nutritional adequacy of the feeds and good feeding practices (

 <xref rid="animals-09-00187-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), suggests the positive role of defatted IPM on the growth performance of rainbow trout even at full FM replacement. It is, however, important to note that optimal FM replacement levels often vary with fish species and the defattening level of the IPM. For instance, 
 <italic class="italic">S. aurata</italic> optimal body-weight gain is achieved when FM is replaced at 25% with full-fat 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> insect meal [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Similar results were obtained for African catfish, where a 20% substitution with full-fat mealworm insect meal improved fish growth performance, but negative performance results were observed if replacement levels exceeded 20% [
 <xref rid="B18-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The significant reduction of feed intake observed in the present study for fish fed on IPM has also been reported for rainbow trout diets with FM replaced with insect meal [
 <xref rid="B14-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. While the latter study attributed the reduction of voluntary feed intake to the high-fat content of the whole-dry-insect meal, this does not apply to the present study where defatted IPM was used. Although the presence of anti-nutritional factors in the IPM used in the present study were not investigated, we hypothesize that the reduction of feed intake observed is probably linked to a better nutritional and metabolic adequacy of diets rather than stress or feed palatability, as indicated by the significantly lower FCR and higher growth performance (
