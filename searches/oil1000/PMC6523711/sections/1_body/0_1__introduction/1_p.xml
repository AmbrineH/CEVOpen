<p class="p">Fishmeal (FM) has been the primary source of protein in aquafeeds due to its high protein content, balanced composition of amino acids, and high palatability. However, the increasing demand for FM and fish oil (FO) by the aquaculture industry, has led to a notable price increase of these two commodities [

 <xref rid="B3-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. For instance, plant-based products made of soy, corn, wheat, have been suggested as possible alternative ingredients with high protein content [

 <xref rid="B5-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, feed ingredients of vegetable origin have disadvantages, such as the presence of anti-nutritional factors, low content of particular essential amino acids, and low palatability [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. More alternative ingredients are therefore needed to sustainably promote aquaculture growth while improving fish growth and health performances.
