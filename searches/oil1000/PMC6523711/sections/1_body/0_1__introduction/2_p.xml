 <xref rid="B9-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Such protein content is within the range commonly observed for FM (73% protein content), but it is superior to that of vegetable sources such as soymeal that contains only up to 50% of protein [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-09-00187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Moreover, the ecological footprint of IM production is relatively small, as there is no need for arable land, and energy and water requirements are considerably lower than those needed for other crops, roughages, and crop by-products [

Given these promising features of IM, several types of insects, such as locusts, grasshoppers, termites, yellow mealworms, Asiatic rhinoceros beetles, superworms, domesticated silkworms, common houseflies, common mosquitoes, and black soldier flies have been evaluated for inclusion in aquafeeds [
