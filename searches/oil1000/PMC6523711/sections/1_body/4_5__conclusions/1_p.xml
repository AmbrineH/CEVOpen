<p class="p">In conclusion, the defatted yellow mealworm protein meal tested in the present study could effectively replace up to 100% of the FM in the diet of juvenile rainbow trout with positive zootechnical and nutrient retention consequences. It is particularly important to highlight that the best growth performance and FCR were recorded when FM was fully replaced by IPM, supporting that this IPM is a sustainable and environmentally friendly source of protein in the diet of rainbow trout. Additionally, the potential effects of IPM on fish immunity and health status are worth further research.</p>
