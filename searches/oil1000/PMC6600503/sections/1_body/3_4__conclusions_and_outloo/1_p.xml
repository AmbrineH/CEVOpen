<p class="p">The primary reasons for poor silymarin bioavailability are elevated metabolism, inefficient intestinal absorption, low aqueous solubility, and rapid excretion in bile and urine. These factors necessitate the incorporation of silymarin into a form that can augment its bioavailability. Therefore, silymarin solubilization is fundamental to obtain an optimal and efficient bioavailability and consequently the formulation strategies designed to improve its solubility are of crucial importance. The reviewed studies reveal that increasingly advanced and performing silymarin-based formulations has logically followed step by step the evolution of the nanotechnologies and nanosystems designed to improve the delivery of poorly water-insoluble drugs and active principle ingredients. Current solubilization approaches highlight, for example, the importance and effectiveness of amorphous solid dispersions and lipid-based drug delivery systems, as well as the use of supersaturated solutions. However, most of the formulation preparations suffer some weaknesses such as very complex processes and lack of reproducibility, which are difficult to translate to industrial production. Besides, the drug loading capacity usually is very low and the preparations are unstable during storage. There is still a long way before they come to market. In future, some advanced type of formulation approaches such as emulsomes, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, dendrimers and carbon nanotubes could be successfully utilized for bioavailability enhancement and targeting of silymarin to hepatocytes.</p>
