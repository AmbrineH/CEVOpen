Therefore, the correct selection of formulation technique and compositional materials to design a suitable delivery system for silymarin play an important role in developing a functional, safe and marketable product eventually. The ambition of the present paper is to summarize and highlight the advances made over the past 15 years regarding the formulation strategies to improve the bioavailability of silymarin, as well as focusing on the emerging trends of the nanodelivery of this drug in new pharmaceutical applications.
