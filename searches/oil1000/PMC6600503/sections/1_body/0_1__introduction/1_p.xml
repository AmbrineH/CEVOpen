<p class="p">The number of scientific reports in the literature testifying to the efforts of experts in the fields of colloidal and pharmaceutical sciences in proposing silymarin-based formulations with enhanced stability and solubility, improved bioavailability and efficient therapeutic performances is constantly growing. Silymarin, an official medicine with recognized hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antiviral and anticancer properties, suffers from poor water solubility, inefficient intestinal absorption, presence of multiple components and elevated metabolism [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In general, these undesired properties pose several concerns in the formulation and design of drug delivery systems since inadequate aqueous solubility of the active ingredients constituting the phytomedicines can affect the correspondent bioavailability [
