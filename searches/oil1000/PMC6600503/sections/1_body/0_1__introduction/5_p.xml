<p class="p">Thus, to apply the concept of supersaturation in order to circumvent the problem of the limited water solubility of silymarin and increase its absorption in the stomach and small intestine, the supersaturated solution must be stabilized through the use of precipitation inhibitors for a sufficient period of time. For example, different degrees of supersaturation and maintenance of the supersaturated state can be achieved using amorphous solid dispersions with different polymers such as PVP and PVA. On the other hands, controlled-release systems would represent one option to avoid excessive supersaturation. Therefore, advanced versions of these formulation strategies provide the ability to control the release profile of the drug in response to external stimuli such pH, ionic strength, magnetic field, ultrasounds, light and heat, which can improve the targeting and allow greater dosage control.</p>
