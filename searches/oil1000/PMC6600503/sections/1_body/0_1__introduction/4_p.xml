<p class="p">Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) have attracted interest in the pharmaceutical industry because they can be dosed as preconcentrates and generate a drug-containing emulsion with a large surface area upon dispersion in the GIT. When used in SEDDS, surfactant molecules in a preconcentrate formulation self-assemble to form nanoparticles containing the drug. Thus, to favour faster absorption, higher concentrations of biocompatible amphiphilic compounds are used to form smaller particles. Another technological approach consists in generating a supersaturated solution, characterized by increased chemical potential compared to a stable, saturated solution. Supersaturation, therefore, is a thermodynamically unstable condition and the system tends to return to the equilibrium state by drug precipitation.</p>
