These include drug modifications such as salts, esters and complexes with hydrophilic excipients have been used to optimize silymarin solubility. Most of the formulation strategies refer to complexation with cyclodextrins or phospholipids (phytosomes), solid dispersions stabilized by biocompatible polymers, micro- and nanoemulsions, lipid-based delivery systems, biodegradable polymeric NPs and inorganic nanomaterials.
