<p class="p">Inorganic nanomaterials are currently considered as powerful and very efficient drug carriers due to their versatile nanostructure, functional properties and controlled drug release behaviors. Moreover, they can exhibit excellent biocompatibility, biodegradation, in vivo stability, low cytotoxicity and nonimmunogenic profiles, thereby making these nanovectors an ideal candidate for oral and parenteral drug delivery [

One of the first applications of these inorganic nanomaterials as carriers of a water-soluble form of SIL (molecular complex with the amino-sugar meglumine), was provided by Cao et al. by engineering hollow-type mesoporous silica NPs (HMSNs) [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>]. They were prepared in a W/O microemulsion formulated with nonylphenol 10 as surfactant and subjected to ultrasound irradiation to generate micropores and microchannels within the silica spheres. The obtained HMSNs with particle sizes within the range of 50â€“100 nm and large specific surface area (386 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/g), were able to load silybin meglumine with EE of about 69%. Correlations between in vitro dissolution rates and in vivo absorption rates were also reported for HMSNs. Other studies reported the synthesis of monodispersed porous silica NPs (PSNs) by applying an ultrasonic corrosion method to create regular nanometer-sized pores with sodium carbonate solution [

 <xref rid="B141-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. SIL-loaded PSNs were obtained by immersing the porous NPs in SIL ethanol solution and stirring for 24 h, and after various treatments the entity of drug entrapment in PSN was quantified in about 69%. The mean hydrodynamic particle diameter was ~57 nm, with unimodal and narrow size distribution. In vivo studies indicated multistage release pattern after oral administration of SIL-loaded PSNs, where an initial delay in the rate of drug absorption was followed by an enhanced extent of absorption with a high plasma concentration maintained even up to 72 h. Those results suggested that the PSNs could be used as a promising SIL nanovectors for sustained-release systems, satisfying the need for prolonged treatment after oral administration.
