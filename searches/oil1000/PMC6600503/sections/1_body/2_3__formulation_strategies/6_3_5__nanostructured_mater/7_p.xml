<p class="p">Another system containing stimuli-sensitive components was reported by Fazio et al. [
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">149</xref>], where SIL and gold nanocolloids synthesized by laser ablation were co-loaded into the PLGA-PEG copolymer in a single step procedure. The SIL-loaded PEG-PLGA-Au nanocomposite with a polymer/drug weight ratio of 50:5, was prepared by a modified emulsion-diffusion method. The hybrid NPs allowed SIL to be released in a controllable manner upon thermal activation of Au NPs incorporated in the polymer matrix, stimulated by irradiation of a red laser source of low power density (21 mW cm
 <sup class="sup">âˆ’2</sup>), partially transparent to human flesh. The localized and intensive heating of Au NPs causes the thermal expansion of the polymer, with the consequent release of drug that starts to diffuse out. As a potential application of this nanocomposite, it was suggested the use of wirelessly controlled nanowires responding to an electromagnetic field generated by a separate device. This engineering system would eliminate the tubes and cables required by other implantable devices with the risk of infections and other complications, and activate the release of the drug near areas of the body that are often difficult to reach.
