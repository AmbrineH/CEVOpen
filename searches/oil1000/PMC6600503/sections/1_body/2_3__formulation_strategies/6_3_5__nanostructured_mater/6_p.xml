 <xref rid="B148-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">148</xref>]. The capability to act simultaneously as drug nanocarrier and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent was tested through various methods and techniques. The zeta potential of bare magnetite NPs in aqueous dispersion changed from negative (âˆ’24.2 mV) to positive (+31.6 mV) values upon coating with chitosan, demonstrating the presence of terminal amino groups on the particle surface. The average particle size was about 18 nm with SLM EE of 95%. In vitro studies revealed a sustained drug release pattern.
