<p class="p">Furthermore, a novel micelle-templated synthesis of porous calcium phosphate microparticles was developed by Zhu et al. [
 <xref rid="B145-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">145</xref>], to improve the delivery of the poorly water-soluble SIL in vitro and in vivo. In particular, a mixed micellar system composed by PVP/SC/phospholipid in suitable mass ratios, was adopted innovatively as a new type of template to fabricate the calcium phosphate micron-sized carriers. The drug encapsulation was proven to be incorporated into the porous structure of microparticles after the removal of the micellar template, thus leading to prolonged release in vitro and enhanced absorption in vivo. An excellent linear relationship was obtained between in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption data, recorded in two media at different pH. This correlation could suggest the possibility to predict in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior through the observed in vitro release profiles.
