<p class="p">Other types of inorganic NPs, such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanospheres and crystalline hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanorods, which enjoy favourable chemical properties similar to the inorganic constituents of natural bone tissue, were exploited by Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">144</xref>] to encapsulate SIL. Drug loading into ACP and HAP was achieved by immersion of both types of NPs, previously synthesized by polymeric micelle-templated technique, in SIL-containing ethanol solutions. Both ACP nanospheres and HAP nanorods manifested relatively high drug loading capacity of 900 and 825 mg g
