<p class="p">An example of nanohybrid materials for the advanced delivery of SIL in therapeutic applications is represented by SIL-loaded magnetite NPs (Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) modified with PLGA-PEG copolymers as reported by Ebrahimnezhad et al. [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">146</xref>], to investigate their inhibitory effect on telomerase expression in T47D human breast cancer cell line. The PLGA-PEG-Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> NPs with a SIL loading capacity of about 76%, besides being biocompatible, possessed the advantage of being directed into the target tissue by the action of an external magnetic field [
 <xref rid="B147-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">147</xref>]. The cytotoxic effect on the T47D cell line increased with increasing the concentration of SIL-loaded NPs, demonstrating the feasibility of this nanodrug in down-regulation of Telomerase gene expression in cancer cells.
