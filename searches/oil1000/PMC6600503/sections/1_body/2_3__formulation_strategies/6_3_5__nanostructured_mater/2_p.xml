<p class="p">Commercially available carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (COOH-MWCNTs) [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>], have been employed by Tan et al. [
 <xref rid="B143-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">143</xref>] to covalently conjugate SIL for the advanced drug delivery in therapeutic applications. Drug release from the carbon nanotubes showed a sustained and pH dependent behaviour while a significant in vitro cytotoxicity was expressed against two human cancer cell lines at lower concentrations of 1.56–6.25 μg/mL when compared to free drug alone.
