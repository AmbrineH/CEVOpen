<p class="p">Other types of molecular complexes capable to enhance the bioavailability of the active constituents of silymarin are represented by phytophospholipid complexes known as phytosomes. The phytosome unit is a molecular complex between phospholipids and standardized polyphenolic constituents in a 1:1 or 2:1 molar ratios, whose various aspects such as interactions, structures, characterization and increased bioavailability can be found elsewhere [

According to several studies, SIL-phytosome proved to be more bioavailable with enhanced therapeutic activities compared to the purified molecular extracts, though most of formulations have been focused on oral and topical drug administration routes [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Besides, mixtures of phospholipid and bile salts forming PC-BS mixed micelles, were found to be good nanocarrier candidates to encapsulate SIL with high loading capacity, due to their physiological compatibility and solubilizing capacity. Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] prepared phospholipidic micelles mixed with BS (SPMM) to solubilize SIL in their inner hydrophobic cores. From pseudo-ternary phase diagram investigations, an optimum micellar formulation was capable to solubilize the drug up to 10 mg/mL, which was also found to double in the presence of PVP [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>], who first prepared a SIL-PPC equimolar complex by TFD method, which was then dissolved in anhydrous ethanol together with PPC and SDC at various molar ratios. After evaporation of the organic phase, the mixed micelles loaded with SIL were reconstituted by adding double distilled water. The optimal formulation led to a SIL loading efficiency of 14.43%, which corresponded to a drug solubility in water of 10.14 Â± 0.36 mg/mL.
