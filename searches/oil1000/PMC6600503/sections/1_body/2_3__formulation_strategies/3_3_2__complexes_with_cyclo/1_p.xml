<p class="p">Natural cyclodextrins (CDs) are widely used in pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, cosmetics, food technology and the chemical industries. They can be found in commercially available medications, including tablets, eye drops, and ointments (see ref. [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. They were prepared by different methods, such as physical mixing, kneading, co-precipitation and solvent evaporation. The inclusion complex prepared by the co-precipitation method led to best results regarding the sustained drug release performance. In another investigation, a lyophilized SIL-HP-β-CD complex was prepared and evaluated in vitro by Kellici et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], who performed detailed physicochemical studies on the SIL-CD interactions at the molecular level and investigated the respective bioavailability on MCF-7 cancer cells. In a different study, SLM inclusion complexes with, respectively, HP-β-CD and RAMEB were developed in order to improve SLM anti-fibrotic activity at a lower therapeutical dose of 50 mg/kg, by increasing their potential solubilization and to prevent their metabolic degradation within the GIT after oral administration, [
