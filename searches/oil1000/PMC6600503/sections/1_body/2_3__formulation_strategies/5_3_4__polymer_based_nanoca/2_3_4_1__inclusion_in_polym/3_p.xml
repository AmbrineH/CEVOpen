<p class="p">Another formulation of SLM (containing 33% of SIL) loaded NPs with particle size of ~ 100 nm, was proposed by Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>] by ESE technique and freeze-drying method, using P188 as polymer. Absorption of SLM NPs in the organs was significantly higher than that of drug suspension and very high SLM concentrations were observed in the liver with a long retention time.
