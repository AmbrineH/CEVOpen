<p class="p">The choice of the formulation method is fundamental to optimize the performance of the final product as described by Sonali et al. [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>], who compared kneading, spray drying and co-precipitation techniques in the preparation of SLM-loaded solid dispersions using HPMC as a hydrophilic polymeric carrier. In vitro studies suggested the following enhancement in SLM dissolution compared to pure drug: co-precipitation (2.5 fold) &gt; spray drying (1.9 fold) &gt; kneading (1.5 fold).
