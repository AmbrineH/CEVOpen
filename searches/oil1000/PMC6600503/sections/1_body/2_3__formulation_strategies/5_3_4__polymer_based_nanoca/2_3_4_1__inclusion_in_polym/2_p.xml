At the optimal pH and chitosan-to-SIL charge ratio, the size and zeta potential of nanoplex were, respectively, 243 nm and 21 mV, while the complexation efficiency and yield were obtained in the range 83–87% and 55–63%, respectively. The nanoplex stability after either short or long-term storage and prolonged supersaturation in the presence of HPMC, demonstrated its feasibility as a new strategy for improving SIL bioavailability.
