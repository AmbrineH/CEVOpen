<p class="p">One of the recently published research reports a formulation composed by SLM-PVP-PEG (0.25:1.5:1.5, on weight basis) in form of polymeric composite, which promotes an increase in SLM solubility of more than 24 mg/mL and an excellent dissolution profile [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. The enhancement in drug solubility and dissolution has been attributed to a better SLM wetting driven by the hydrophilic polymers, complete conversion of the crystalline components into the amorphous state and molecular level homogeneousness of SLM, PVP and PEG in the resulting polymeric composite.
