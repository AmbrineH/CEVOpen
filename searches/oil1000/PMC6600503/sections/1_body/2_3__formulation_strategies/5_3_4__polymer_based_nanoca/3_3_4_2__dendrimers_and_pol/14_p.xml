 <xref rid="B134-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">134</xref>] reported the design of polyethylene sebacate (PES) NPs functionalized with the polysaccharide pullulan (PUL) as hepatic targeting agent. SLM was entrapped into the NPs prepared by nanoprecipitation method giving rise to final the PES-SLM-PUL biodegradable polymeric nanocarrier. The EE was about 43% with mean particle size of 283 nm.
