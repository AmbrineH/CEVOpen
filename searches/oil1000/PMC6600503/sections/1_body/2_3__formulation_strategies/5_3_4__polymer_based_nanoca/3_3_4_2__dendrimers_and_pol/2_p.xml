<p class="p">In particular, both amine-terminated full generation (G2 and G3) and ester-terminated half-generation (G1.5 and G2.5) PAMAM dendrimers, were tested for their potential use as SIL solubility enhancers [

 <xref rid="B126-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. Low molecular weight drugs such as SIL, may be encapsulated into the inner core of PAMAM dendrimers or interact with their positively charged surface groups. The estimated number of SIL molecules incorporated into dendrimers ranged between 20 and 32 for G2 and G3 while for G1.5 and G2.5 it was comprised between 4 and 6. The analysis of pharmacokinetic experiments and oral bioavailability data demonstrated that drug-dendrimer complex could improve the oral absorption of SIL.
