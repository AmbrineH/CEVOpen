<p class="p">The weight ratio of SLM:PLGA had a significant effect on the overall entrapment, especially for the most hydrophilic compound among all the components (TXF). After an initial screening of experimental variables, it was found that the EE of the relatively more hydrophilic components TXF, SILcr and SILdi was always much lower than those of SIL and isoSIL. The optimized conditions to prepare PLGA NPs with the ESE method, enabling the synchronous encapsulation of all the active compounds, were observed in correspondence of an increase of both ionic strength and pH, and PVA aqueous solutions saturated with SLM.</p>
