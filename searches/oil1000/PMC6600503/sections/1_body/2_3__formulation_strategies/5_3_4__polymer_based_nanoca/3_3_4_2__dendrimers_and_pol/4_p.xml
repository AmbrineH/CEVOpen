<p class="p">A recent investigation reported also the use of partially PEGylated PAMAM-G4 dendrimers as solubility enhancers and supramolecular carriers for SIL, using two intermediate PEG chains sizes and substitution percentages close to 50% [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]. It has been shown that PEGylation with 2.0 kDa PEG chains provided high drug solubility and extended drug release time compared to analogous dendritic nanovehicles decorated with shorter PEG chain (0.55 kDa). Moreover, 2D-NOESY experiments revealed that the preferential binding sites for SIL association were found at level of both internal branches and external PEG chains.
