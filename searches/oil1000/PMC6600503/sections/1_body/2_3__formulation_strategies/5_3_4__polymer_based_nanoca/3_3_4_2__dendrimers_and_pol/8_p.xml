<p class="p">To reduce the entrapment difference observed for the active components of a plant extract due to their different physicochemical properties, some researchers have developed the concept of synchronous encapsulation of multiple components of SLM into PLGA NPs. Indeed, due to the complexity of herbal medicine compositions, it is desirable to maintain the mass ratios of the multiple components in dosage forms and to achieve synchronous release both in vitro and in vivo because the pharmacological effect would highly depend on such ratios [
