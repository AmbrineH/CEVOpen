<p class="p">Polymeric PLGA NPs, prepared by the single ESE technique, have been also used to solubilize SLM isolated from the seeds of some native milk thistle ecotypes of the Egyptian Delta as described in [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">129</xref>]. Then, the SLM-loaded PLGA NPs were encapsulated into a calcium-crosslinked alginate matrix to obtain a series of biodegradable pH-responsive hydrogel microparticles. The developed particles showed promising biodegradability and sustained SLM release profiles, as well as improving overall drug dissolution.
