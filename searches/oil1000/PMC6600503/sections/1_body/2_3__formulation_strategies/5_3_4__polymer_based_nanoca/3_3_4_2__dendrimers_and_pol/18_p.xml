<p class="p">The in vivo hepatoprotective activity of SLM entrapped into chitosan NPs (SLM-NPs) by ionotropic gelation method, and the anti-inflammatory effect of inulin nanoparticles (IN-NPs) synthesized using the emulsion method, were evaluated singly or in combination against the hepatotoxicity induced by the mycotoxin DON [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. Biochemical results showed that the combined treatment with SLM-NPs plus IN-NPs overcame significantly the toxicity of DON in the liver.
