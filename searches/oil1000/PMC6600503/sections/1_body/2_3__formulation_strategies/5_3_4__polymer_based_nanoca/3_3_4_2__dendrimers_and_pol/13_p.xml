<p class="p">Among various methods used in the preparation of chitosan NPs, namely, microemulsion, ESD, polyelectrolyte complexation and ionic gelation, the latter was adopted by Pooja et al. [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>], to prepare chitosan-TPP NPs for SIL oral delivery. The optimal formulation was characterized by EE of about 83% with particle size of 264 nm (PDI &lt; 0.3) and positive zeta potential (37.4 mV). SIL was amorphous and homogeneously dispersed in the polymeric matrix and no chemical interaction between drug and chitosan was deduced from the FTIR spectra analysis. Cytotoxicity studies revealed that SIL entrapped in chitosan NPs was more effective as anticancer agent than free drug.
