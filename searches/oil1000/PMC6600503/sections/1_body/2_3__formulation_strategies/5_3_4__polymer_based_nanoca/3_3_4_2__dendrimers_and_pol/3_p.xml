<p class="p">One of the open question is the mechanism whereby PAMAM dendrimers increase the small intestinal absorption of the drug. Probably more than one mechanism, such as the effect of paracellular transport of drug-dendrimer complexes through the epithelium, improved contact with the epithelium itself and higher absorption through the endocytosis process, could contribute to the greater oral bioavailability of SIL vehicled by PAMAM dendrimers.</p>
