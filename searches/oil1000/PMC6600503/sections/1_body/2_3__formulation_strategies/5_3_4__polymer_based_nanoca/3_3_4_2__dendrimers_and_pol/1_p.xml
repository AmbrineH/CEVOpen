<p class="p">Dendritic macromolecules such as PAMAM are hyper branched biocompatible polymers, widely employed as nanocarriers for the encapsulation and delivery of compounds either by supramolecular complexation (encapsulated drug) or covalent attachment (conjugated drug) [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. Each repetitive branching represents a new dendrimer generation (G), which determines the molecular weight, size and number of primary amine sites.
