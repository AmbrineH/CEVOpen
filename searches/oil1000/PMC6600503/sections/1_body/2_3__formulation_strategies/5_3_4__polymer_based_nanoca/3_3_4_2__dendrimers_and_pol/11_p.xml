<p class="p">Analogously, SLM-loaded PCL NPs formulated by ESE technique, showed sustained release, improvement in bioavailability as well as enhancement of liver protection following i.v. administration [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. Particle sizes and EE were 130–430 nm and 91–95%, respectively, depending on polymer concentration. Increase in polymer content led also to delayed drug release due to increase in particle dimensions.
