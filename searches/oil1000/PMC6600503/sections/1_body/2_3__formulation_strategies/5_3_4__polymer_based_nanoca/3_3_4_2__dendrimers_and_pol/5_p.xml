<p class="p">Alternative nanocarriers are represented by the polymeric micelles, used as a multifunctional drug delivery platform to improve the solubility, stability, and delivery efficiency of poorly soluble drugs. SLM solubilization into polymeric micelles was achieved using an amphiphilic derivative of the carboxymethylchitosan (CMCHS) synthetized by Sui et al. [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Polymer amount of 10 mg/mL improved the concentration of solubilized SLM 13 times more than that of pure drug dissolved in water. SLM-loaded polymeric aggregates were found much bigger and polydisperse than blank micelles. In vitro tests showed a slow SLM release from micellar solution, lasted up to 40 h.
