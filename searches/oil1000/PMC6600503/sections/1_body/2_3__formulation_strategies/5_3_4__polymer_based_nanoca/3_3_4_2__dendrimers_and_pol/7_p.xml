<p class="p">PLGA polymeric nanocarriers were also used by Snima et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>] to produce SLM NPs through the ESE method. The particle hydrodynamic diameter was ~ 220 nm and SLM EE was 60%. In vitro tests showed a slow and sustained drug release profile at physiological conditions. Moreover, the NPs with desired drug release kinetics, were capable of delivering SLM into prostate cancer cells to induce differential anticancer effect.
