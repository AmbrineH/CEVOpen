<p class="p">In the following subsections, various approach specifically designed for silymarin delivery will be reviewed and systematically classified in the final Table 1, including the suitable cross references mentioned in the text. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02155-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the types of formulations that have been developed to improve the solubility and bioavailability of silymarin, most of which being designed primarily for oral administration. Henceforth, the acronyms SLM and SIL will be used, respectively, to indicate the silymarin powdered extract and its main purified active constituent silybin or silibinin. The meaning of the other acronyms is shown in the list of abbreviations at the end of the review.
