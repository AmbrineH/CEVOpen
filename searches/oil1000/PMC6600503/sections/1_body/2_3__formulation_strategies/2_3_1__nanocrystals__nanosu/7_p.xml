<p class="p">SLM/PVP solid dispersion prepared by a fluid-bed coating technique, was also designed as payload of a monolithic osmotic tablet consisting of a tablet core and semi-permeable coating of cellulose acetate with mechanically perforated release orifices [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. This delivery system permitted the synchronized release of the multiple components of SLM in solubilized state under the driving force of the osmotic pressure. In vitro release profiles indicated that the overall release rate was adjustable by monitoring the formulation variables.
