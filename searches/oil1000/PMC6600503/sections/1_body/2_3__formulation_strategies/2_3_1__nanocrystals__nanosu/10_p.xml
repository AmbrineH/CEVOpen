<p class="p">The anticancer efficacy of SIL nanosuspensions was also tested by Zheng et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], by carrying in vitro assays on human prostatic carcinoma PC-3 cell line. The HPH method has been recently used to test the feasibility of SIL nanocrystals as stabilizing agent of a Pickering emulsion of glyceryl monocaprylate oil droplets in water and provide a novel formulation free of any surfactants or polymer stabilizer [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The authors obtained flat spherical drug nanocrystals with mean particle size of 300 nm for homogenization pressure as high as 100 MPa. Scanning electron micrographs supported a core-shell microstructure of the emulsion characterized by a core of oil saturated with SIL and a shell of SIL nanocrystals. Compared with SIL nanocrystalline suspension (SN-NCS), SIL nanocrystal self-stabilized Pickering emulsion (SN-SSPE) showed a better dissolution profile with a faster rate and more efficient dissolution. This difference was attributed to the fraction of drug dissolved in the oily phase of SN-SSPE, which could be released more easily than SN-NCS.
