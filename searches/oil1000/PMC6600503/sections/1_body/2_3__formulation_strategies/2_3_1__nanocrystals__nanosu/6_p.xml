<p class="p">This strategy, besides using water instead of the organic solvent, led to a reduced ratio of hydrophilic polymeric carrier and drug in the final solid dispersion. A series of 1% aqueous solutions of biocompatible polymers and surfactants were tested to evaluate their capacity as SLM carriers in enhancing the aqueous solubility of the drug. PVP and Tween 80 provided the highest drug solubility of about 800 mg/mL and 2500 mg/mL, respectively, and were selected for preparing SLM-loaded solid dispersions. The optimised SLM/PVP/Tween 80 formulation (5:2.5:2.5, w/w/w), combined both relatively smaller amounts of carriers and increased drug solubility and dissolution. Compared to a commercial product, the proposed solid dispersion improved the oral bioavailability of the drug in rats by almost 3-fold and also exhibited advanced hepatoprotective bioactivity.</p>
