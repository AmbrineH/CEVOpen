<p class="p">Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] used the HPH technology to design SIL nanosuspension formulations for oral and i.v. administrations with different particle sizes. XRPD and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments showed that the crystalline structure of SIL was not perturbed as a result of the homogenization and freeze-drying processes. In vitro dissolution profiles and solubility tests of various nanosuspensions, including unmilled commercial SIL and a physical mixture for comparison, yielded an increase in solubility and dissolution rate following the reduction of particle size as predicted by the Noyes-Whitney equation [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Such nanosuspensions were able to improve the permeability of the transport of SIL across the Caco-2 cell monolayer. In vitro results were further confirmed by the pharmacodynamics and tissue distribution studies in beagle dogs and mice [
