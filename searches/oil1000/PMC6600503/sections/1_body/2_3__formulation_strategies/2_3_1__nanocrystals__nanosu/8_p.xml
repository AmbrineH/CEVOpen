The resulting microparticles were characterized by a narrow size distribution with mean value of 4.4 Î¼m, and extract EE of about 85%. The water-soluble microencapsulated powder dramatically improved both in vitro dissolution and permeation rates, suggesting a higher SLM bioavailability after oral administration.
