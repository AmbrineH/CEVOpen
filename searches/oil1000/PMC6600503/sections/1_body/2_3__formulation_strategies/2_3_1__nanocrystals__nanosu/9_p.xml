That work was the first reporting SIL-loaded nanodispersion produced via microfluidics, enabling efficient control over the particle size, homogeneity, and drug release performance. The antisolvent precipitation with a syringe pump (APSP) was employed to produce SIL-loaded NPs in order to improve the bioavailability of the hydrophobic cargo [
