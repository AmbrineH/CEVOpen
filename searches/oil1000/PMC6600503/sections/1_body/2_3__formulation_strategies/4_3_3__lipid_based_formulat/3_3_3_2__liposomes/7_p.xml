<p class="p">A more recent development of using ligand-functionalized liposomes to improve the SIL bioavailability is reported in the work published by Ochi et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], who demonstrated a synergic effect on the liver cancer cell line HepG2, provided by the co-encapsulation into PEGylated nano-liposomes of SIL and GA. The liposomal suspensions, prepared by the TFD method followed by sonication, were formulated with SIL and GA at a 1.74:1 molar ratio together with a mixture of DPPC, CHOL, and mPEG2000-DSPE at a specified molar ratio. Scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that the co-encapsulated nanoliposomes had a mean diameter of 43 nm while the zeta potential was âˆ’23.25 mV, sufficient to inhibit liposome aggregation.
