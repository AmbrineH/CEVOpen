<p class="p">To overcome instability problems that commonly occur in the GIT and improve the poor aqueous solubility of SLM, El-Samaligy et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], investigated the feasibility of encapsulating the drug in a liposomal dosage-form for buccal administration via spray. Liposomes were prepared by RPE method using a base lipid mixture of soybean lecithin and CHOL in a 9:1 optimized molar ratio. In addition to the basic liposome ingredients, various additives were gradually introduced, such as positively (SA) or negatively (DCP) charge inducers and non-ionic surfactants (Tween 20 or Tween 80). At the end of a multifactorial screening, an optimal composition for hybrid liposomes was derived as lecithin/CHOL/SA/Tween 20 at 9:1:1:0.5 molar ratios, which warranted both best SLM EE of about 69% and high in vitro absorption and permeation performances [
