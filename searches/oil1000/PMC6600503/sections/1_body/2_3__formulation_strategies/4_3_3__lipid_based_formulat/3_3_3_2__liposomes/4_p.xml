<p class="p">In order to improve the stability of liposomal nanocarriers and enhance the SLM encapsulation, Xiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] adopted the strategy of “proliposomes”, which are defined as dry, solid particles that form a reconstituted liposomal suspension when put in contact with water [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. SLM-proliposomes were prepared by film-deposition using mannitol as carrier and a mixture of methanol and chloroform (2:1 v/v) as the apolar medium to dissolve both drug and phospholipids. The content of SLM in the proliposomes was 9.73% (w/w). In the reconstituted liposomal suspension, the mean particle size was about 200 nm while a mean value for SLM EE was about 93%. After oral administration in beagle dogs of drug entrapped in the reconstituted liposome suspensions (drug equivalent to 7.7 mg kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> were, respectively, 2.46 ± 0.58 μg h/mL and 0.47 ± 0.13 μg/mL.
