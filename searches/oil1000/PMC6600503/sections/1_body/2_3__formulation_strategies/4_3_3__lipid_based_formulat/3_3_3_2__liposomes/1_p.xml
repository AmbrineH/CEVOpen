<p class="p">Liposomes are hollow spherical NPs with a closed shell of a lipid membrane (mono- or multi-layer), inside of which an aqueous solution can be encapsulated. These supramolecular aggregates owe their success as carriers of therapeutic drugs for many advantages including the capability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, having targeting and controlled release properties, cell affinity, tissue compatibility, reduced drug toxicity and improved drug stability [

Moreover, liposomal systems are known to find an immediate access to the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) rich sites like liver and spleen, and this self-targeted nature of liposomal carriers can be exploited well for drug distribution to hepatic site. During the researches, the conventional structures of the liposomes have been subjected to several changes, which have brought out a series of new type liposomes, such as long-circulating stealth liposomes, stimuli-responsive liposomes, cationic liposomes and ligand-targeted liposomes [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Liposomes can be prepared using a wide range of methods, such as thin-film dispersion (TFD), reversed-phase evaporation (RPE), alcohol injection, and spray-freeze-drying. Other strategies comprise proliposomal formulation, with the use of a cryoprotectant and high process temperature, and supercritical fluid of carbon dioxide method (SCF-CO
