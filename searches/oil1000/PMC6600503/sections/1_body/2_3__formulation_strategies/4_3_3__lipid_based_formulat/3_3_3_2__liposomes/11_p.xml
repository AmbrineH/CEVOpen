<p class="p">A recent study reported on the effect exerted by SLM contents and type of BS on the drug EE in BS-liposomes (bilosomes) prepared with TFD method [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. The obtained vesicle dispersions were characterized by highly negatively charged zeta-potential values compared to an analogous preparation formulated with CHOL in place of BS. Considering particle dimensions, bilosomes containing SC exhibited the largest particle diameter (595.1 Â± 98.48 nm) among all BS investigated. Among all the screened formulations, the optimum composition in terms of highest SLM EE (84.54%) corresponded to a lipid molar ratio 4:1 for SPC/SC system. In vitro release studies revealed biphasic pattern of all formulations while in vivo investigations revealed that bilosomes showed a pronounced effect in retaining the hepatoprotective as well as oxidative stress biomarkers to their normal levels against CCl
