<p class="p">The strategy of ligand-functionalized liposomes as nanocarriers for SLM was adopted by Elmowafy et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] to design PEGylated liposomes decorated with the hepatic targeting ligand Sito-G (a carbohydrate epitope). The surface modified liposomes prepared by TFD method, contained fixed 2:1 molar ratios of HSPC and CHOL with or without PEG as well as a varying concentration of Sito-G to check its optimal amount for improving the targeted delivery of the encapsulated SLM to hepatic target cells. The combination of relatively high melting point HSPC with a high percentage of CHOL provided liposomes with very rigid lipid bilayers. The obtained multilamellar vesicles were exposed to several freeze-thaw cycles in which the liposomes were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 2 min and defrosted in warm water bath for 2 min. The submicron-sized liposomes were prepared by using a pressurized extruder with two polycarbonate membrane filters with pore size of 100 nm. The final lipid concentration in the liposome formulations was 4 mg/mL. The particle size distribution of the liposomes with mean values in the range 145–168 nm showed very good homogeneity (PDI 0.15–0.3). An acceptable drug EE was recorded for all tested formulation (about 60% in average), although high contents of Sito-G were found detrimental to the stability of liposomal membrane, thus leading to a decrease in the EE. A systematic investigation of the in vitro release profiles performed with the dialysis method (37 °C in HEPES buffer, pH = 7.4), indicated that PEGylated liposomes exhibited a sustained SLM release as compared to conventional liposomes. On the other hands, PEGylation of liposomes equipped with Sito-G manifested a reduced SLM cellular uptake with HepG2 cells compared to non-PEGylated nanocarriers.
