<p class="p">Liquid crystalline (LC) cubosomes coupled to P407 have been also formulated to enhance the oral bioavailability of SLM [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. The LC matrix system was prepared by a melting/congealing method with GMO to P407 ratio of 100:12 at which cubic LC phases formed upon hydration. The amounts of drug dispersed as amorphous state in the matrices were fixed within the range 2â€“8%. SLM entrapped into the GMO-P407 LC system, manifested a 3.5-fold increase in bioavailability after oral administration as compared with a commercial drug formulation. Finally, for an applicability of SLM in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD), a novel formulation was designed by using pluronic-lecithin organogels, owing to their biphasic composition and versatility as transdermal and topical DDs [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. The tested formulations contained 20% oil phase (lecithin/IPM) and 80% aqueous phase (pluronic). The high penetrating ability and hydration effect of the organogel base, provided a significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of AD patients.
