<p class="p">One of the first liposomal formulations of SLM reported in literature dates back to the early 2000s. The study by Maheshwari et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>], focused on the development of factors such as the drug to lipid ratio, the proportion of CHOL and presence of the charge inducer DCP in the optimization of the formulation prepared by ethanol injection. The highest drug entrapment of about 95% was achieved in the formulation with SLM/PC/CHOL/DCP ratio of 2:10:2:1. The obtained size range of SLM-loaded liposomes (56âˆ’1270 nm with median diameter of 390 nm) was suitable for i.v. administration for hepatoprotective studies in mice. A drug leakage of about 40% was observed in 28 days as well as evident aggregation phenomena recorded after 3 weeks of the preparation.
