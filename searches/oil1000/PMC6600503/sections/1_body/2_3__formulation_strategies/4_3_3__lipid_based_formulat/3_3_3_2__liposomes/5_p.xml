<p class="p">The proliposome nanotechnology was also exploited to improve the water solubility and bioavailability of 2,3-dehydrosilymarin, an oxidized form of SLM characterized by significantly greater antioxidant and anti-cancer activity than the reduced precursor [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Hence, the 2,3-dehydrosilymarin-loaded proliposome powder was produced by the TFD-freeze drying method obtaining a polyphase dispersed system composed of phospholipids, CHOL, IPM and SC, with optimal drug-lipid ratio set to 1:3 [

The correspondent drug content after reconstitution with water was 25.00 ± 5.93 μg/mL, yielding EE of about 82%, which was predominately dependent on the drug/phospholipid and SC/phospholipid ratios. The improved oral absorption in rabbits was ascribed to the relatively small size of liposomes distributed in the range 7–50 nm and average diameter of about 16 nm. The AUC and C
