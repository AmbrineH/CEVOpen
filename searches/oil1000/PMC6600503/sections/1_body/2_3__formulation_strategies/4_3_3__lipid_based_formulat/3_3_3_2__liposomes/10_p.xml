The optimized product provided better performances than liposomes prepared with more conventional methods such as RPE or TFD. Based on the analysis of drug release profiles in vitro, the novel formulation improved the SLM solubility. In vivo tests showed an improved oral bioavailability of drug administered in liposomes containing BS (AUC 18.406 ± 1.481 μg h/mL; C
