<p class="p">Besides enhancing drug bioavailability, the liposomal formulation developed by Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>], was designed to promote the regeneration of hepatocytes and to prevent inflammation in liver. The SLM EE of liposomes prepared with the TFD technique, was found to be maximum (55%) for formulation containing SPC and CHOL at molar ratio 6:1. The optimal liposomal formulation yielded a 3.5-fold higher SLM bioavailability (AUC 0.500 ± 0.023 μg h/mL) than the correspondent drug suspension. Likewise, C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was found 5.25-fold (0.716 ± 0.043 μg/mL) higher than the drug suspension. Analysis of in vivo studies suggested that SLM encapsulated in said liposomal carriers might have targeted inflammatory cells resulted in increased anti-inflammatory activity.
