<p class="p">A slightly different approach was explored by Angelico et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] in the preparation of liposomes loaded with SIL-phytosome rather than using the commercial purified SIL extract in the formulation. The addition of lecithin in the starting lipid film based on SIL-phytosome such that the final phospholipid/SIL ratio reached 6:1, yielded stable phytoliposomes with the suitable surface charge and average dimensions in view of a potential parenteral i.v. use, where the nanoparticle size is a critical parameter to be controlled. The cellular uptake of SIL encapsulated into phytoliposomes and its antiviral activity were also tested in vitro with Huh7.5 cells [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. The data clearly demonstrated that the cell absorption was 2.4-fold more efficiently than free SIL, and 300-fold more potent pharmacological activity. It is worth noting that the phytoliposomes were able to reduce the hepatitis C virus infection by inhibiting the entry of viral particles into cells.
