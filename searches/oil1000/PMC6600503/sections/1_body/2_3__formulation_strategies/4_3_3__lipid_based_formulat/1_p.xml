<p class="p">A widespread formulation strategy exploits lipid-based colloidal vehicles as winning option for the delivery of SIL penalized by the poor aqueous solubility. Lipid-based formulations (incorporation of the active lipophilic component into inert lipid vehicles) are used to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drug compounds, which include micro- or nanoemulsions, oils, self-emulsifying formulations, surfactant dispersions, proliposomes and liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles and lipid nanocarriers, etc. These lipid formulations can be broadly divided into two groups, namely, liquid oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions (LEs) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). The LE systems could be lipid solutions, emulsions, microemulsions and self-(nano-/micro-) emulsifying drug delivery systems. SLNs are novel lipid-based formulations which are constituted exclusively of biodegradable lipids such as highly purified triglycerides, monoglycerides, hard fats, complex glyceride mixtures or even waxes, which are solid at physiological temperature.</p>
