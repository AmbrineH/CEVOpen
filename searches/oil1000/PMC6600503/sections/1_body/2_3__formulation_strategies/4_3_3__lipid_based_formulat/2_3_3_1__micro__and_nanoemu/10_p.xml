<p class="p">In a more recent investigation, SLM enriched nanoemulsions were formulated using different oils such as sunflower, EVO and castor oils, respectively, [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. SLM solubility in castor oil was 0.668 ± 0.072 mg/g whereas in EVO and sunflower oils was rather lower. However, upon addition of Tween 80 in oil (10 mg/g), drug solubility increased up to reach 1–2 mg/g in the three tested oils. Coarse emulsions were first prepared by mixing 200 g oil+SLM with 1 L of aqueous phase and then subjected to HPH, giving rise to final droplet sizes in the range 200–300 nm. Moreover, it was found that the greater the oil susceptibility to oxidation, and thus the formation of oxidation products, the greater the drug degradation incorporated into nanoemulsions.
