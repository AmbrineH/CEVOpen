 <xref rid="B72-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] optimized SLM-loaded SEDDS formulations based on ethyl linoleate, Cremophor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL and ethyl alcohol, which were selected regarding the self-microemulsifying ability, solubilization ability, and reduced use of surfactant. The best combination of ingredients screened after a systematic pseudo-ternary phase diagram study, yielded a drug solubility of 130.8 mg/mL homogeneously dispersed in small O/W droplets with mean size in the range 20–30 nm and no changes were detected at 40 °C for 3 months. Both the in vitro release performance and in vivo bioavailability after oral administration of SLM from SEDDS were evaluated and compared with the commercial preparation Legalon
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>. The relative drug bioavailability of SEDDS to commercial suspension was 227%.
