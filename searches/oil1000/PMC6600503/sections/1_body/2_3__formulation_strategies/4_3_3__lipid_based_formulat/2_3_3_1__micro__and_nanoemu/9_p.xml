<p class="p">A SLM-loaded liquid nanoemulsion was formulated by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], using the SPG membrane emulsification technique and then spray-dried to obtain solid state NPs. Dissolution, bioavailability, and hepatoprotective activity in vivo were assessed by comparison with a commercially available SIL-loaded product. Optimal formulation was composed by SIL, castor oil, PVP, Transcutol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Tween 80, and water at the weight ratio of, respectively, 5:3:3:1.25:1.25:100. The mean sizes of the SLM-loaded nanoemulsion and NPs obtained after spray-drying were about 170 and 214 nm, respectively. The drug bioavailability after oral administration from the NPs was about 1.3-fold higher than that obtained with a commercial product (Legalon
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>).
