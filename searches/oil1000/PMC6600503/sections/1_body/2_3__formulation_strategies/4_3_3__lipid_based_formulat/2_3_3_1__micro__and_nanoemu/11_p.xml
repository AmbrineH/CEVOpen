<p class="p">In another recent study, Nagi et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] employed a Box-Behnken statistical design (BBD) to optimize SLM-loaded nanoemulsions using Capryol 90 as oil phase capable of solubilizing SLM up to 40 mg/mL, in terms of various factors such as processing pressure and number of cycles of HPH technique and amount of surfactant/cosurfactant mixture. The non-ionic hydrophilic surfactant Solutol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> HS 15 was selected due to its high capacity to solubilize hydrophobic drugs and low toxicity (LD50 &gt; 20 mg/kg) [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], and used in combination with Transcutol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> selected as cosurfactant on the basis of the good miscibility with Capryol 90 and Solutol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> HS 15. The optimal nanoemulsion satisfying the criteria of low droplet size and low PDI, necessary for high drug release potential and drug permeation through the GIT membrane, was characterized by nanodroplets of about 50 nm (PDI: 0.45) and zeta potential −31.49 mV. The values of AUC and C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of that nanoemulsion formulation after oral administration were found equal to 28.69 ± 3.28 μg h/mL and 3.25 ± 0.48 μg/mL, respectively, i.e., 1.9-fold and 2.7-fold higher than those of a marketed drug suspension.
