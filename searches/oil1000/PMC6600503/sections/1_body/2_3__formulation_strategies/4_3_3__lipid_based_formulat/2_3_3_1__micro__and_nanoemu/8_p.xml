<p class="p">A very stable O/W nanoemulsion consisting of SLM solubilized in nanosized oil droplets dispersed in an aqueous medium by a mixture of Tween 80 and ethanol as co-surfactant, was optimized through a systematic investigation on experimental pseudo-ternary phase diagrams [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Among various tested oils such as OA, IPM, Triacetin, the highest value of SLM solubilisation was observed in Sefsol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 218 (~183 mg/mL), which was selected for the nanoemulsion formulation at 5% w/w in water. After oral administration of drug solubilized in the nanoemulsion, AUC and C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> were, respectively, 199.45 ± 56.07 μg h/mL and 31.17 ± 7.56 μg/mL, namely, 4-fold and 6-fold higher than those of the correspondent SLM aqueous suspension.
