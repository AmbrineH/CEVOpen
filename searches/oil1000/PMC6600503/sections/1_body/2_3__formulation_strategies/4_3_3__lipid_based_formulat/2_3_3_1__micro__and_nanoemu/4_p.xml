<p class="p">Another optimized SEDDS was prepared using 10% GMO as the oil phase and 15% SLM, with 37.5% of a surfactant mixture of Tween 20 and HCO-50 (1:1), and 37.5% Transcutol

 <xref rid="B71-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The authors evaluated also the drug solubility in various solvents at 25 °C. The O/W microemulsion was generated upon water addition until reaching a maximum water content of 95.4%. After aqueous dilution, the mean droplet size of the internal oil phase was about 67 nm. The release rate of the drug from the SEDDS measured through in vitro dissolution tests, was approximately 2.5 times higher than that from the reference commercial product (Legalon
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>). After oral administration, SLM-loaded SEDDS showed a 360% higher bioavailability compared with the reference formulation.
