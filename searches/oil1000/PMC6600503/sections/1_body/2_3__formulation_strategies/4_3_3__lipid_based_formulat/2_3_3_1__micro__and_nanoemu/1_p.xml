<p class="p">The formulations based on both microemulsion and nanoemulsion strategies for oral/topical administration, are designed with food-acceptable or generally recognized as safe (GRAS) components to increase solubility, stability, and improve the SIL permeability. For example, O/W microemulsions were formulated to incorporate 2% w/w of SLM as a potential dermal delivery system. In particular, microemulsions containing IPM as oil phase emulsified with a 1:1 mixture of water-dispersible Labrasol
