<p class="p">SLM-loaded lipid O/W emulsions were optimized by testing the emulsification properties of soybean lecithin as surfactant and Tween 80 as cosurfactant in combination with several food grade oils (soybean oil, castor oil, and olive oil) [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The authors reported that SLM was added to the lipid phase in soybean oil as 10% aqueous solution in 1 M NaOH up to an optimum drug loading of 1% w/w to produce an emulsion stable for 35 days, constituted by oil droplets with size distribution range of 0.31–1.24 μm and median diameter of 0.46 μm. The in vitro drug release behaviour was faster from the SLM-loaded lipid emulsion as compared with a SLM propylene glycol solution.
