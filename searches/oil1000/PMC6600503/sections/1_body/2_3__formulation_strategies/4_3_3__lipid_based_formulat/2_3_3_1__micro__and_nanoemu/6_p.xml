<p class="p">To overcome the side effects caused by high surfactant levels usually employed in SEDDS, Wei et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] designed a supersaturable SEDDS (S-SEDDS) formulations to improve SIL oral bioavailability. It consisted of a reduced amount of surfactant in combination with HPMC added in the liquid SEDDS to induce a supersaturated state in vivo by preventing or minimizing the SIL precipitation. The authors evaluated also the SIL solubility in various oils, surfactants and cosurfactants at 25 °C. Labrafac
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> CC showed the highest drug solubility and was selected as an oil phase for the formation of S-SEDDS. Cremophor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> RH 40 was chosen as a surfactant for its good emulsion-forming ability and smaller droplet size of the optimized SIL loaded emulsion (~50 nm), thanks also to the synergic effect of the compresence of Transcutol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> and Labrasol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> as cosurfactants. From in vitro studies, it was confirmed the stabilizing effect of HPMC in maintaining high SIL solution concentrations (supersaturated state). Precipitates collected after the in vitro tests from the S-SEDDS formulated with HPMC, were identified as amorphous SIL while crystalline precipitates were found when HPMC was absent in the formulation. Relative drug bioavailability after oral administration of a SIL dose of 533 mg/kg was found higher for S-SEDDS than SEDDS, i.e., same formulation without HPMC. In particular, C
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was 16.1 μg/mL as compared to that of the SEDDS formulation (5.68 μg/mL), while AUC of SIL from S-SEDDS was approximately 3.0-fold higher than that of SEDDS.
