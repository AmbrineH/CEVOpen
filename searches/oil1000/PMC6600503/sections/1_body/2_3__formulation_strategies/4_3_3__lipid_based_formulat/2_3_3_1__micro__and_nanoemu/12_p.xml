<p class="p">In a recent study [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>], it was reported that a commercial SLM extract could be completely solubilized at the dosage of 40 mg/mL in a nanoemulsion formulated using 2.5 g of Labrasol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (20%) as the oil phase and 2.5 g of Cremophor
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> EL/Labrafil
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> as the surfactant/cosurfactant mixture in a 1.5: 1 ratio, the remaining mass being deionized water (60%). Besides, the authors determined selectively the solubility of the main constituents identified in SLM extract, such as, TXF, SILcr, SIL and isoSIL, in various oils, surfactants, and cosurfactants to ascertain the appropriate components of the nanoemulsions. The SLM extract loaded within O/W nanodroplets showed excellent physical and chemical stability, as the size (30–40 nm) and PDI (0.114–0.179) were unaffected and no degradation of active constituents was recorded over 40 days of observation. In vitro permeation studies were performed to determine the suitability of the prepared nanoemulsion for oral delivery.
