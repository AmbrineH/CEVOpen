 <xref rid="B74-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], to test the radioprotective potential of SLM-loaded nanosuspensions against γ-radiation-induced oxidative damage in human embryonic kidney cells. The formulations were designed to act as SEDDS after water addition, until the oil phase was 10–15% at the end of the dilution process. HEK cells viability upon treatment with variable concentrations of SLM-SEDDS and bare drug suspensions as control was checked prior to irradiation. Radiation-induced apoptosis was estimated by microscopic analysis and cell-cycle estimation. The proposed formulation based on SEDDS technology to improve the SLM bioavailability was found radioprotective, supporting the possibility of developing new approaches to radiation protection via colloidal dispersions of SLM.
