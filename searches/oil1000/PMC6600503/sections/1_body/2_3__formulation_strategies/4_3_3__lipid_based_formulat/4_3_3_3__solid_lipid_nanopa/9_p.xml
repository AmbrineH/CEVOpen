<p class="p">Thanks to the good biocompatibility and biodegradability, the emulsomes nanoencapsulation technology has been recently applied to provide particle stability, high EE, and sustained SIL release, [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. The preparation followed the TFD method with the variant of choosing a solid lipid matrix at r.t. such as triglycerides composed of natural unbranched fatty acids or glycerol triesters of saturated fatty acids (e.g., trilaurin), in place of biocompatible oils as internal phase in which SIL has to be dissolved. Other ingredients were CHOL and Tween 80 mixed together with trilaurin and PC in chloroform solution. The film obtained after solvent removal was hydrated and homogenized by ultrasonication to obtain SIL-emulsomes, which were characterized by average particle diameter of about 364 nm and zeta potential of âˆ’34 mV. SIL-emulsomes exhibited sustained release in vitro and better pharmacokinetic parameters in vivo compared with SIL solution as control.
