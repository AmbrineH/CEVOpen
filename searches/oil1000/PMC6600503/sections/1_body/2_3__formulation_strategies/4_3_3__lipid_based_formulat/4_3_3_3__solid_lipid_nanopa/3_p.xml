<p class="p">Furthermore, in an interesting work by Shangguan and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>], it was reported the performance in animal models of both SLM-loaded SLNs and SLM-loaded NLCs, by comparing their oral bioavailability with that of their lipolysate counterparts and fast-release formulations. The goal was to determine whether and to what extent the integral lipid NPs contribute to the overall bioavailability of SLM selected as a poorly water-soluble model drug.
