<p class="p">Regarding the ability of NLCs to efficiently entrap SIL and thus increase its bioavailability and consequent therapeutic activity, it can be mentioned the work published by Jia et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>], who exploited the potential of this formulation strategy for i.v. SIL delivery. For the preparation of SIL-NLCs with the ESE method at a high temperature followed by solidification at a low temperature, GMS was used as solid-lipid ingredient while MCT was selected as liquid-lipid material. First, a nanoemulsion was obtained by adding dropwise a hot alcoholic solution of SIL, lipids (GMS and MCT) and lecithin, to an aqueous phase containing 1.5% Pluronic F68 under mechanical stirring. Then, the nanoemulsion was quickly dispersed into cold distilled to promote the SIL-loaded NLC dispersion. The mean particle size was about 230 nm and zeta potential âˆ’20.7 mV. It was also observed that the drug EE and drug loading increased from 72.31 to 96.87% and from 3.63 to 4.84%, respectively, with the increase of MCT% from 0 to 30 wt% [

From in vitro studies, a burst drug release was detected at the initial stage due to a fraction of SIL loaded into the liquid-lipid-enriched outer layers of NLCs. Afterwards, a more prolonged drug diffusion occurred when the fraction of SIL dispersed into the NP core was gradually released by erosion of the lipid matrix. Moreover, SIL-NLCs showed higher AUC values and a prolonged residence time in the blood circulation compared with SIL solution as control.
