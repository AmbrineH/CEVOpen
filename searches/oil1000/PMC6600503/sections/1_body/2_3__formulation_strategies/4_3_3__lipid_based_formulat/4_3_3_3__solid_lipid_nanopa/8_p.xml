<p class="p">With the aim of improving the drug loading in SLNs and therefore increasing its oral bioavailability, Ma et al. pursued the strategy to encapsulate fatty acid (FA)-SIL conjugates into lipid nanovehicles and compare the oral fate with bare SIL [

 <xref rid="B109-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. Three types of FA derivatives characterized, respectively, by 6C-, 12C- and 18C-long chains attached at level of 7-OH position of SIL (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02155-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), were encapsulated in SLNs prepared with hot HPH method using Precirol
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> ATO 5 as lipid matrix and Tween 80 as the emulsifier. The mean particle diameter and zeta potential determined for the various SLN formulations with EE 100% were, respectively, in the range 102–140 nm and between −11.1 and −13.5 mV. Lipolysis studies conducted in SIF indicated that SLNs loaded with each of the three types of FA-SIL underwent complete degradation within 70 min, showing lower rates for SIL conjugates with longer chains. Based on the pharmacokinetic results, the authors argued that the lymphatic route could play a leading role in the transport of integral SLNs. Notably, taking together all the results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo observations, the authors were able to deduce the fate after oral adsorption of FA-SIL conjugates encapsulated in SLNs and the underlying mechanisms of enhanced bioavailability.
