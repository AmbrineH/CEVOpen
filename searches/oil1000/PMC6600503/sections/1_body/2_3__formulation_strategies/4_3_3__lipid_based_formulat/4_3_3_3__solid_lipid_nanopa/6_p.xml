 <xref rid="B106-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>] proposed a novel SLNs formulation based on SA covalently grafted with PEG 1000 (Brij 78) as stealth agent to form a hydrophilic steric barrier around the lipid NPs. SIL-loaded stealth SLNs were prepared according to the EES method, which consisted in the preliminary preparation of a lipid emulsion, obtained by adding dropwise an organic phase of SA and SIL to an aqueous phase containing the non-ionic surfactant Brij 78. After solvent removal by evaporation, the resulting emulsion system was quickly added to a given volume of cold water to obtain a final suspension of SIL-loaded stealth SLNs. The authors observed that the rate of addition of organic phase to the aqueous phase was the crucial step in preparing the emulsion. A systematic investigation was carried out in order to optimize the drug EE and the homogeneity of particle size distributions. The mean particle size of the optimized formulation was 179 nm (PDI 0.168) and zeta potential of âˆ’25 mV, which represented quality values of good stability. In vitro assays by dialysis method revealed a very slow drug release, a property considered beneficial for SIL bioavailability after oral administration.
