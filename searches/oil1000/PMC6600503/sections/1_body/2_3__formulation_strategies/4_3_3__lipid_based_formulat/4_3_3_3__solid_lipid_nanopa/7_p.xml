<p class="p">In an analogous application of the EES method to prepare SLM-loaded SLNs, a lipid phase composed of SA and Capryol 90 was emulsified in aqueous phase containing Brij S20, and subsequently added to cold water to induce the formation of lipid NPs. The mean particle size, zeta potential and EE were found correspondent to, respectively, about 214 nm, âˆ’32 mV and 92% [

The ability of NLCs to prevent the burst release and gastric deterioration of SLM has been documented by in vitro release studies. Moreover, permeation studies indicated that the formulations were successful in enhancing the cellular uptake of SLM and that the transport of the NLCs across the cell monolayer was energy-dependent and mediated by clathrin- and caveolae (or lipid raft)-related routes.
