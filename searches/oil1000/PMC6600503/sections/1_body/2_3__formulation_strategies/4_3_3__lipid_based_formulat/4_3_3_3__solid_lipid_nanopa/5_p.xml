<p class="p">Experimental evidences of the anti-hepatotoxic property of SLM encapsulated in SLNs were reported in Cengiz et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>], who tested their formulations against the liver damage induced in model animals by the administration of a combination of the hepatotoxin D-GaIN and TNF-α. The solid lipid nanosuspensions based on Compritol and Tween 80, were prepared through the hot homogenization technique. The resultant colloidal SLM-loaded dispersions were characterized by particle sizes varying in the range 165–200 nm with zeta potential of −26.5 mV. Both in vitro and in vivo tests demonstrated that SLM-loaded SLNs were more effective than control in curing liver damage, mainly owing to the slow and regular drug release.
