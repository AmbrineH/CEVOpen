<p class="p">In an earlier study, SLM-loaded SLNs were developed using the emulsifiers Compritol 888 ATO, soybean lecithin and P188 and both hot and cold variants of the HPH method were compared each other to check differences in drug incorporation modes and release mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. From the analysis of results obtained by centrifugal ultrafiltration method, the SLM EE in the cold preparation reached 87% with a fraction of adsorbed drug of about 8%, while for hot homogenization the EE was 43% and the fraction adsorbed was 54%. The in vitro tests carried out by reverse dialysis bag technique at pH 7.4, showed a prolonged drug release for SLM-SLNs produced by cold homogenization. In vivo studies after oral administration of the cold preparation showed high drug levels and long residual time in the plasma and liver after oral administration of the cold preparation compared to SLM aqueous suspension.
