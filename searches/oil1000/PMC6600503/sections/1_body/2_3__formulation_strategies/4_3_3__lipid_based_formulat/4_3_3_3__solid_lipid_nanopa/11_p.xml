<p class="p">More recent improvements in the formulation of NLCs as SLM delivery systems considered several variants of preparation such as, e.g., the hot HPH method as described by Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>]. The resulting formulations, based on GDS and OA as the solid and liquid lipids, respectively, and lecithin and Tween-80 as the emulsifiers, yielded SLM EE and loading capacity of about 87% and 8.32%, respectively. The average particle size was ~80 nm with mean zeta potential of −65 mV. The enhanced bioavailability of SLM-NLCs (2.54- and 3.10-fold that of commercial Legalon and solid dispersion pellets, respectively) was interpreted in terms of facilitated absorption by the lipid-based DDs. Another investigation used GMS, CP and SA as solid lipids and CA and OA as liquid lipids [

Various mixtures of solid/liquid lipids preloaded with SLM alcoholic solution, were heated and emulsified in aqueous phase containing Tween 80. The prepared pre-emulsions were ultrasonicated and then refrigerated to favour lipid crystallization. The final separation of the resulting NPs was performed by ultra-centrifugation. All the formulations were analyzed according to the Box-Behnken factorial design. Organ distribution studies revealed that SLM loaded in NLCs containing GMS and OA (particle size ~224 nm and EE ~79%) underwent selective liver uptake through the chylomicron pathway. In Iqbal et al., [

 <sup class="sup">®</sup> 218) mixed lipids dissolved in ethanol together with SLM, which was heated at 60 °C and emulsified by sonication at 70 °C to remove the organic solvent by ESE. The Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) was employed for optimization of SLM-loaded NLC dispersions and the resulting best formulation (particle size ~126 nm and EE 85%) was freeze dried and incorporated in hydrogel matrix of Carbopol for epidermal tissue deposition to use SLM as chemoprevention of skin cancer. Finally, SEDDS and NLCs were employed to enhance SIL oral bioavailability at level of GIT and treat obesity-induced NAFLD [
