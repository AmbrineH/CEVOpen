<p class="p">Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are the first generation of lipid-based nanocarriers that are formulated from lipids, which are solid in the body temperature and stabilized by emulsifiers [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Emulsomes are special case of SLNs, considered as the solid state version of common uninamellar and multilamellar lipid vesicles, i.e., NPs with an internal solid fat core surrounded by one or more phospholipid layers [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. For an exhaustive discussion about pros and cons occurring in the use of this type of lipid nanocarriers see, e.g., a recent review by Ghasemiyeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>]. Differently from matrices having either solid (SLNs) or liquid lipids (LEs) as core composition, the nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), which belong to the second generation of lipid NPs, represent hybrid formulations prepared by blending solid lipids and liquid lipids, thus resulting in a less ordered inner structure [
