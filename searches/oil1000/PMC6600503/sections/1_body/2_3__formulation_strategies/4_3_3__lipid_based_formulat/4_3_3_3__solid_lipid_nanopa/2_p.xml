<p class="p">The application of SLNs drug delivery strategy was pursued by Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-24-02155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>] who first prepared a SIL-PC complex at a mass ratio of 1:3 by TFD method, which was subsequently dissolved in anhydrous ethanol together with a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E (TPGS) and PC at ratios 4:1:20, w/w/w. After ultrasonication and further solvent evaporation, the resultant lipid film was hydrated in distilled water leading to a lipid suspension, which was sonicated until a translucent colloidal dispersion was obtained. The aim was to test the anti-metastatic effect of SIL in combination with TPGS co-entrapped in SLNs, to suppress effectively the metastasis of breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. The average particle size was about 45 nm with a zeta potential value of 2.78 mV and the SIL entrapment efficiency (EE) was approximately 99%. The in vivo results supported the potential use of SIL-TPGS loaded SLNs as an anti-metastasis agent capable to inhibit the invasive and metastatic activities of breast cancer cells instead of acting a cytotoxic effect against them.
