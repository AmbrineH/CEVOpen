<p class="p">Its molecular structure possesses a chromone fragment responsible for its weak acidic properties, enabling donor-acceptor interactions with bases. The presence of polyphenol hydroxyls and the ability to form complexes with transition and other metal ions in the 3,4- or 4,5-positions, confer high antioxidant capability to the molecule. Several studies have shown that for this active ingredient even very high doses are well tolerated by animals and humans [
