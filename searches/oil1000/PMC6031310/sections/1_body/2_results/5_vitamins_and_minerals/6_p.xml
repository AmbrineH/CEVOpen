<p class="p">A complete multivitamin complex can meet the daily needs of vitamins, always coupled with sufficient food intake. Vitamin B2 or riboflavin is found in avocados, dairy products, eggs, nuts, wheat germ and yeast. It is very important in the cellular respiration, maintenance and restoration of the tissues. Vitamin B3 or niacin is essential for skin health, participates in the metabolism of carbohydrates, protects the digestive system and nervous system. Its richest sources are fish, liver, meat, yeast, peanut and whole grains. Vitamin B5 or pantothenic acid is important for macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of the nervous system. It is also produced by intestinal bacteria. Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine participates in the metabolism of proteins and in the formation of red blood cells found in bananas, fish, potatoes and also produced by intestinal bacteria. Vitamin B9 or folic acid present in dark green leaves and orange participates in DNA production, cell division, neural tube formation of the fetus, formation of red and white blood cells and protection against pernicious anemia, common in bariatric patients

 </xref>. The vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin, on the contrary, is present only in foods of animal origin, normally rich in proteins such as meats, milk and their derivatives. Its absorption is greatly impaired after gastric bypass due to the reduction of the intrinsic factor of the stomach and loss of its absorptive site, which is the ileum. Its lack is risky to the nervous system, because it can cause forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty of concentration and tingling in hands and feet. Even if the patient consumes these foods, this vitamin must be permanently replenished throughout life, either orally, intramuscularly or sublingually

Its biggest source is sunlight, so it is recommended that the patient sunbathe daily, preferably without sunscreen for 15 min. Synthetic supplementation is routine in both the previous and postoperative period, on average 2000 UI per day
