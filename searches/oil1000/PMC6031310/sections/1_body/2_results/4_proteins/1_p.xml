<p class="p">Proteins are biological macromolecules made up of one or more chains of amino acids and participate in almost all cellular processes. They have essential functions such as DNA replication, molecular transport and response to stimuli. They function as enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions vital to metabolism, participate in the cell cycle and in the immune response. Proteins differ fundamentally in their amino acid sequence, which is determined by the genetic sequence and which generally causes their knotting in a specific three-dimensional structure that determines their activity
