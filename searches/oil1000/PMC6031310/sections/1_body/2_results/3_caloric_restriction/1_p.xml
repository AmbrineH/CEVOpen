<p class="p">Bariatric surgery, both by restrictive and mixed technique, requires a reduction in daily caloric intake compatible with the reduction of gastric pouch. Thus the daily calorific value ingested by a patient starts on average with 500 kcal in the liquid feed and progressively evolves to a solid consistency up to 1.200 kcal per day. Nutritional recommendations following bariatric surgery are described in guidelines that mention the need for protein from 1-1.5 g/kg of ideal weight (60-80 g/day, 25%), carbohydrates (45%) and lipids (30%)
