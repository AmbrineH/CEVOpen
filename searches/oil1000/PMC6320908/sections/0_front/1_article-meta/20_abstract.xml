 <p class="p">Oral candidiasis (OC) is an infectious disease caused by microorganisms of the genus 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>, leading to lesions in the buccal cavity. Its treatment consists of the administration of topical or systemic antifungal agents, which may compromise the patient compliance due to its side effects, highlighting the need for alternative treatments. In this scenario, bullfrog oil, an animal oil composed of a pool of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, is introduced as a potential antifungal raw material. Thus, the aim of this work was to produce a mucoadhesive emulsified system able to deliver the bullfrog oil in the buccal cavity to treat the OC. The emulsion was produced and characterized by visual inspection, droplet size, polydispersity index (PdI), and zeta potential over the course of 60 days. In addition, its mucoadhesive ability was evaluated using an in vitro mucin model. The antifungal activity, evaluated by the broth microdilution assay and the biocompatibility, performed against human erythrocytes, were also carried out. The emulsion showed a droplet size of 320.79 ± 35.60 nm, a PdI of 0.49 ± 0.08, and a zeta potential of −38.53 ± 6.23 mV, with no significant changes over 60 days. The mucoadhesive properties of the system was improved by the use of pharmaceutical excipients. The antifungal activity showed that the bullfrog oil and the emulsion were able to inhibit the growth of different 
  <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species. Furthermore, the emulsion showed no significant hemolytic effect. Overall, the system showed suitable physicochemical characteristics and biocompatibility, with substantial in vitro antifungal activity, suggesting that this system can be further investigated for OC treatment.
