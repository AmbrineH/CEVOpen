<p class="p">The PI is a parameter widely used to measure the lipid hydroperoxides, a primary product of the lipid oxidation. This process affects the organoleptic characteristics (odor and appearance) and quality of natural oils, as it might lead to the formation of toxic compounds due to the decomposition of unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids presented in the natural oils [

Our result indicates that this marketable bullfrog oil has suitable quality, with low oxidation levels, evidencing a preservation of the unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, as shown for the bullfrog oil obtained by the study that evaluated different extraction processes [
