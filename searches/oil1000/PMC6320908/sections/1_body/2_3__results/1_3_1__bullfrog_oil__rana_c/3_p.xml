<p class="p">Furthermore, the AI was also evaluated since this parameter measures the free fatty acid content and indicates the hydrolytic degradation process caused by the presence of water molecules and lipases enzymes which promotes fatty acid cleavage, compromising the oil quality [

This result is in agreement with the literature, where an AI value near 2.90 mg KOH/g oil was obtained in the bullfrog oil extracted from the adipose tissues of the amphibious
