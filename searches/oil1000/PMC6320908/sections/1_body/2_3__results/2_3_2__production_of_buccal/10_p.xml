<p class="p">The zeta potential of the BBE was also evaluated over 60 days. This parameter is directly related to the electrostatic stability of emulsified systems because the electrical charge promotes droplet repulsion, avoiding flocculation [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Thus, absolute values of zeta potential higher than 30 mV indicate that the repulsive forces are stronger than the attractive ones, impeaching the oil droplets approximation and further instability [

 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The BBE showed an initial zeta potential value of −38.53 ± 6.23 mV, suggesting electrostatic stability, corroborating to the data observed for a topical nanoemulsion produced with bullfrog oil in its internal phase, as described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In addition, over the period of 60 days, the zeta potential of the BBE remained steady (−33.77 ± 4.03 mV), data that allows us to conclude that the emulsion presents a suitable electrostatic behavior regarding its ability to avoid instability phenomena that may compromise its quality. Furthermore, the BBE viscosity was also evaluated according to the shear rate and the shear stress variations. This analysis suggested the rheological behavior of the system, predicting its spreadability and residence time in the biological surface of the buccal mucosa [

 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Furthermore, a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior was observed with the shear rate and the shear stress variations, since the viscosity decreased according to the increase of these parameters (data not shown). For a shear rate of 228 s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at 25 ± 2 °C, the BBE showed a viscosity of 39.0 ± 0.2 cP. These results indicate a suitable viscosity and rheological characteristic of BBE, once the pseudoplastic behavior is desired to the buccal delivery, allowing the easy spreadability of the system, and thus, improving its contact with the buccal mucosa cell [
