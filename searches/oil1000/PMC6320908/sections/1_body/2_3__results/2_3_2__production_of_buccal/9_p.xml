<p class="p">Additionally, at the end of the stability study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00257-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) an increase in the droplet size was observed. Right after its production, the droplet size was 320.79 ± 35.60 nm, whereas after 60 days an increase to 436.10 ± 72.70 nm was observed. The PdI remained constant (from 0.49 ± 0.08 to 0.50 ± 0.02) throughout the study, suggesting an absence of instability phenomena that may lead to phase separation [

 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Based on these results, it is possible to suggest that BBE may be used on the treatment of no extensive lesions of OC. In fact,
