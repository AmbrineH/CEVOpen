<p class="p">On the other hand, due to the large interfacial area presented in the emulsified systems, the occurrence of instability phenomena such as flocculation, coalescence, creaming, and phase separation over the time was accentuated, demonstrating the importance of the use of pharmaceutical excipients to improve emulsion stability [

Thus, an experimental design study was previously performed to define the best pharmaceutical excipients and their concentrations, improving the organoleptic characteristics of the bullfrog oil and thus enabling the system to be used by oral and buccal routes [
