<p class="p">Moreover, the stability of the BBE was also followed by the analysis of the droplet size and the zeta potential, which are parameters related to the physical and electrostatic stability of emulsified systems, respectively [

Indeed, the monitoring of the droplet size allows the identification of instability phenomena that are not detected by visual inspection, such as flocculation (aggregation/approximation of the oil droplets due the interaction energy and low distance between the droplets) and coalescence (collision/fusion of two or more oil droplets to form a single larger droplet) [
