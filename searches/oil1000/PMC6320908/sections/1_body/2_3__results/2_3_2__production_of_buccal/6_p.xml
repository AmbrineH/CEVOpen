<p class="p">Furthermore, high conductivity values reinforced the characterization of the formulation as an O/W system, since this parameter indicates the external phase characteristic of the emulsion [

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), which indicates an external aqueous phase, similar to the water conductivity and characteristic of the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions [
