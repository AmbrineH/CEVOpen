<p class="p">The BBE showed a droplet size of 320.79 ± 35.60 nm and a polydispersity index (PdI) of 0.49 ± 0.08. Similar results for droplet size of nanoemulsions can be found in the literature [

 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Droplet size data also contributes to the classification of emulsified systems as macroemulsions (&gt;1 µm), nanoemulsions (size around 300 nm), and microemulsions (size lower than 100 nm). However, it is important to highlight that the evaluation of other parameters such as visual appearance, polydispersity index, and kinetic and thermodynamic stability, needs to be also considered for a correct classification [

 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. For instance, nanoemulsions show low PdI, kinetic stability, and particular visual characteristics (Tyndall effect) that are not observed in the BBE [
