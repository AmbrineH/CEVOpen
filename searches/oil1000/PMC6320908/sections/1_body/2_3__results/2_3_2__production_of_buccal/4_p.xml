<p class="p">Additionally, the physicochemical aspects (pH, conductivity, droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential) were also assessed. The emulsion pH value was slightly acidic (6.05 ± 0.02) which was maintained over time, showing a non-significant decrease at the end of 60 days (5.76 ± 0.17). This slightly acid characteristic may be attributed to both the fatty acids presented in the chemical composition of the bullfrog oil [
