<p class="p">The hypothesis of delay on the in vitro antifungal activity of the emulsified systems was also described in the literature for copaiba essential oil and its nanostructured emulsion. In fact, the pure copaiba essential oil showed MIC values of 0.1083 ± 0.076 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.1083 ± 0.038 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> ATCC 2001 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> 15V3C, respectively, while the nanoemulsion produced with this oil presented MIC values of 15.6 ± 0.0 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.9736 ± 0.0 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the respective yeasts [

 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>, allowing us to suggest that this emulsion can be used as an alternative treatment in OC.
