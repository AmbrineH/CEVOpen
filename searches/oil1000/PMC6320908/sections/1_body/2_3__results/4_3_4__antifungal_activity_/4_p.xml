<p class="p">It’s important to highlight that the MIC values of the BBE were higher than that of the pure bullfrog oil, data that can be explained by the depot effect of the emulsified systems [

This phenomenon is responsible for promoting a delay in the in vitro assay due to a slow release of the active compounds incorporated in the emulsion internal phase. Indeed, the surfactant layer in the oil droplets’ surface needs to be unstructured to deliver the internal phase compounds [
