 <italic class="italic">C. dubliniensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> reference strains can be related to the resistance profile of these yeast strains, or also due to the fungal cell structure (fungal cell wall composition or the fungal phospholipidic membrane) [
 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. This hypothesis can be reinforced by the literature, which describes that due to the fungal cell structure, different 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. can present variations in the wall composition and organization, reflecting directly on the antifungal activity of natural oils in its natural form [

 <italic class="italic">C. dubliniensis</italic> CBS 7987 and 
 <italic class="italic">C. glabrata</italic> ATCC 2001, respectively. This result can be attributed to an improvement of the absorption of natural oils by the fungal cells caused by emulsified systems, since the emulsion composition can interact with the fungal cell wall or even with the phospholipidic structure of the fungal cell membrane, promoting the interaction between the oil and the microorganism and thus improving its antifungal activity [
