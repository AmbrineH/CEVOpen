<p class="p">Additionally, the BBE was able to reduce the hemolytic effect of the bullfrog oil from 40 ± 6% to 22 ± 2% at 1.0 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, highlighting the ability of this system to increase the biocompatibility of the bullfrog oil at this concentration. Indeed, emulsified systems are widely used due to their ability to reduce toxic effects of drugs or natural oils, by promoting a slower release of the active compounds from their internal phase, avoiding an excessive amount of the delivered compound being released at once to promote toxicity or side effects [
