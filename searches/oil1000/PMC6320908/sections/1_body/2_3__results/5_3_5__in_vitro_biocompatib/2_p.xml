<p class="p">Thus, the hemolytic potential of the bullfrog oil and the BBE was evaluated against human erythrocytes to assess the safety and biocompatibility of the produced formulation. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-10-00257-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows that the bullfrog oil at the concentration of 1.0 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was able to promote a hemolytic effect of 40 ± 6%, probably due to its rich composition of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids that may interact with the phospholipids in the erythrocytes membranes. This leads to the ability that natural oils have in promoting cell membrane disruption and in increasing the cell membrane permeability, resulting in a complete hemolysis with hemoglobin release [

 <xref rid="B63-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. On the other hand, as the concentration decreased, the hemolytic effect was reduced significantly. Indeed, at concentrations of 0.5 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.25 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the bullfrog oil hemolytic effect was reduced to 25 ± 3% and 15 ± 6%, respectively, which suggests that the hemolytic effect was concentration dependent, showing the probable biocompatibility of the bullfrog oil at these concentrations.
