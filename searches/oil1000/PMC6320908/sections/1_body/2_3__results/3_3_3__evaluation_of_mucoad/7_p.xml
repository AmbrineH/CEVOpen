<p class="p">Additionally, it is possible to compare the results obtained by these two different approaches used to assess the mucoadhesivity. Indeed, the mucoadhesion study, performed by the tensile stress, showed an increase of the work forces necessary to separate the probes after contact to the BBE compared to the BE. On the other hand, the variation of the droplet size and the zeta potential showed higher interaction between the mucin molecules to the BE droplets compared to the BBE, which allowed mucin to be available on the external phase and cause mucoadhesion. Based on the fundamentals of each performed test, these results corroborate to the hypothesis that the pharmaceutical excipients were able to increase the physical interaction between the system and the mucosa.</p>
