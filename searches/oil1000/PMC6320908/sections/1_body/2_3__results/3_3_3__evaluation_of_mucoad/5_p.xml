<p class="p">On the other hand, due to the presence of pharmaceutical excipients in the external phase of the BBE, the mucin molecules presented in the dispersion may have a difficulty on interacting with the oil droplets, once some excipients, such as the xanthan gum, are able to chemically interact with the mucin molecules as previously discussed. Thus, these data allow us to suggest that the non-expressive increase in the droplet size of BBE, when compared to the BE, can be attributed to the reduced amount of free mucin available to interact with the oil droplets, since these molecules are possibly interacting with the xanthan gum in the external phase.</p>
