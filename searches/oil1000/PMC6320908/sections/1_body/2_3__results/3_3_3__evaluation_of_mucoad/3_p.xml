<p class="p">The BE showed a maximum peak force of 7.44 ± 1.53 mN to be detached from the mucin membrane, with a debonding distance of 949.94 ± 92.72 mm, resulting in

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), highlighting the superior capacity of the BBE to adhere to the mucin membrane. This data can be attributed to the composition of the BBE if it presents pharmaceutical excipients, such as xanthan gum and sweeteners, which may improve the adhesion ability of the system. In fact, the xanthan gum is a anionic polymer widely used in pharmaceutical systems due to its mucoadhesive properties, since its molecule presents a helical form with D-glucose residues and glucuronic acid groups between mannose units, providing a steric conformation able to form secondary bonds with the human mucin [

The mucin type II used in this test is derived from the porcine stomach and is chemically and structurally similar to human mucin, allowing us to suggest that BBE is able to interact with the mucus from the human buccal mucosa and to deliver the bullfrog oil [
