 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00257-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> also shows the zeta potential of the BBE and the BE. It is possible to observe a difference in this parameter for both systems, reinforcing the hypothesis that mucin was able to adhere to the oil droplets surface. Indeed, this molecule presents sialic acid residues linked to the terminal region of the oligosaccharide chains that lead to a negative surface charge [

 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], which makes this molecule able to adsorb on the particles and/or the oil droplets, promoting changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the system, as described on the literature [

 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Furthermore, although both samples and mucin solutions have a negative charge, their interaction is possible because the negative charge of the mucin solutions was close to the isoelectric point, allowing the electrical and chemical interaction of the oil droplets and preventing the electric repulsion. In addition, it was also observed that the zeta potential of the BBE increased according to the mucin concentration in the dispersions, data not observed for the BE, corroborating to the results obtained by the tensile stress test and highlighting the superior mucoadhesive ability of the BBE.
