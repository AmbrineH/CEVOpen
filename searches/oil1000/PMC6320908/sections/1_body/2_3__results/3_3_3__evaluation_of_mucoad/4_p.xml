<p class="p">Additionally, the mucoadhesive potential of the BBE and the BE was also assayed by the measurement of the droplet size and the zeta potential of these systems before and after contact with mucin solutions at different concentrations, as described in the 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00257-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Initially, the BBE showed a droplet size of 320.79 ± 35.60 nm and a zeta potential value of −38.53 ± 6.23 mV, whereas the BE presented a droplet size of 186.7 ± 2.7 nm and a zeta potential of −18.20 ± 1.42 mV. As seen in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00257-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, both emulsions had a significant increase in droplet size, suggesting the interaction of the mucin molecules with the oil droplet surface. In addition, a significant statistical difference was observed in all tested concentrations (

In fact, the interaction between the mucin molecules and the oil droplets is a phenomenon described in the literature [

 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Due to the ability of mucin to promote chemical interactions with the surface of oil droplets, large aggregates are formed due to the occurrence of flocculation involving the oil droplets, resulting in a significant increase in droplet size. Furthermore, as the BE did not have stabilizing agents in its composition, the mobility and the contact of the oil droplets with the mucin molecules was facilitated, allowing their interaction, and resulting in a noticeable increase in the droplet size.
