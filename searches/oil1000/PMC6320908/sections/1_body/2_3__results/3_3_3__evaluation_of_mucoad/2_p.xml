<p class="p">The mucoadhesion performance was carried out by the tensile stress test, which consists in a specific apparatus in which the emulsions were placed into an inferior probe that interacts with a superior probe, containing a previously prepared mucin membrane, for a specific time. After the interaction, the maximum force and work required to separate the probes were calculated considering the debonding distance, thus reflecting the mucoadhesion properties of the analyzed system [
