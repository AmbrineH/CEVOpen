<p class="p">The epithelium surface of the buccal mucosa is covered by a mucus layer responsible for its lubrication, protection, and hydration. This layer is composed by a viscoelastic network of water (95%) and mucin (5%), a glycoprotein responsible for the viscosity and gel properties of the mucus [

 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Thus, many studies have evaluated the interaction between dispersed systems and this glycoprotein with the purpose of predicting the mucoadhesion ability of these systems, which is related to increased interactions with the buccal mucosa and site-specific delivery of drugs and/or bioactive compounds [

Based on this rationale, the BBE was designed to be used on the buccal mucosa as potential treatment to non-extensive lesions of OC. Its ability to adhere to the buccal epithelium was assessed by in vitro mucoadhesion measurements using two different approaches: (i) the mucoadhesion performance and (ii) the variation in droplet size and zeta potential due to the interaction between the emulsion and the mucin [
