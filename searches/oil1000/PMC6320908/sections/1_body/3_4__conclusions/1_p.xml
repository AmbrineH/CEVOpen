<p class="p">The results of this work showed that the buccal bullfrog oil emulsion has macroscopic and physicochemical characteristics (droplet size and zeta potential) compatible with stable emulsified systems for over 60 days. In addition, the pharmaceutical excipients used on this formulation provided mucoadhesive properties through its ability of interacting with the mucin, suggesting a buccal mucosa adherence that would allow this system not only to treat local infections, but also to be absorbed and enter the bloodstream. In this regard, the system showed concentration-dependent biocompatibility against human erythrocytes. Furthermore, the produced system inhibited the growth of distinct species of
