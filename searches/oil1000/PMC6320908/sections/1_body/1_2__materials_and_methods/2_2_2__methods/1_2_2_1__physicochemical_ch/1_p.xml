After complete dissolution, 3 mL of purified water was added and the mixture was titrated with 0.01 N sodium thiosulfate solution using starch as indicator. The AI was determined by the titration of 0.5 g of bullfrog oil solubilized in 2.5 mL ether-alcohol solution (1:1

In addition, the II was determined by the titration of 0.2 g of bullfrog oil, 8 mL of chloroform, and 20 mL of wijs solution. This mixture was kept under dark conditions for 30 min and, then, 30 mL of potassium iodide 15% and 80 mL of water were added for titration with sodium thiosulfate (0.1 N) using starch as indicator. The SI was assessed using 1 g of bullfrog oil and 25 mL of alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide (0.5 N). This mixture was titrated with hydrochloric acid (0.5 N) using alcoholic phenolphthalein 1% as indicator.
