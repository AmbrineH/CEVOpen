<p class="p">The viscosity evaluation of BBE was performed in triplicate at 25 ± 2 °C using a cone and plate (CP) rheometer (Brookfield-model RV-III, New Castle, DE, USA) equipped with a CP 42 spindle. The sample (1 g) was placed in the spindle and the viscosity was measured under progressive rotation between 35–60 rpm with interval of 5 rpm. The rotation was maintained for 10 s at each speed and the data of shear rate, shear stress and viscosity were analyzed by the Rheocalc V 3.01 software.</p>
