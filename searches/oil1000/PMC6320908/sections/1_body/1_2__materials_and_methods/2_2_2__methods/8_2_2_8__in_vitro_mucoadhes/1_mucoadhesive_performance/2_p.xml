<p class="p">Initially, mucin disks were prepared as a model membrane using a manual tablet press machine, Korsh, Model EK-0 (KORSH America Inc., South Easton, MA, USA) (12 mm diameter punch, 172 ± 2 mg), which were fixed at the superior probe of the texturometer and washed with 200 µL of ultrapure water at 37 °C for 2 min. The BBE and the BE were added to the texturometer inferior probe and maintained at 37 °C during the test execution. Posteriorly, the superior probe (initial height of 700 mm) was moved down at the speed of 2 mm·s
