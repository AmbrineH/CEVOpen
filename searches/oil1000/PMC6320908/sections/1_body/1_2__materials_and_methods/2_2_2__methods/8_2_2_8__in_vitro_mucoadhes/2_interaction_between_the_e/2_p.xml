<p class="p">Initially, the droplet size and the zeta potential were evaluated using a ZetaSize NanoZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Then, 50 µL of the emulsions were added in 10 mL of the mucin solutions and kept for 1 h at 37 °C under moderate magnetic stirring. Subsequently, the droplet size and the zeta potential were reevaluated under the same dilution condition as described in
