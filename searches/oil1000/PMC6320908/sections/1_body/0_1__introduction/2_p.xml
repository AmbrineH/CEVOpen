<p class="p">Among oral infections, oral candidiasis (OC) represents the most frequent oral fungal infection, caused by the photogenic growth of different 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Candida parapsilosis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Candida tropicalis</italic>, which are responsible for 30 to 45% of oral fungal infections in the general adult population [

 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Oral candidiasis is one of the most common clinical symptoms of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and transplanted patients [

 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The pathogenicity of these species is assigned to virulence factors that promote the adhesion to host cells, affecting the buccal keratinized mucosa and oral prosthesis, with possible biofilm formation on host tissues or medical devices, contributing to the maintenance of the infection, allowing the microorganism to escape from host defense mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-10-00257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and increasing its ability to invade the colonized tissue, promoting oral mucosa damage [
