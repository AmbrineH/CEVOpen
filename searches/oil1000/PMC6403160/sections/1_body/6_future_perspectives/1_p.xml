<p class="p">The role of nutrition as a potent modulator of the endocrine system governing feeding behavior and growth in fish is described in this review. Aquaculture research is a topic of increasing interest due to the demand for sustainable food production. That makes it essential to summarize the knowledge generated in the last past years in order to identify the weak points and to determine the direction in which new studies should be focused. As described here, food availability and feed composition are two of the most influent external signals modulating appetite-regulating and growth modulatory hormones. Future research should, therefore, be focused on tapping into this knowledge, expanding it in depth, and exploring its use to enhance feeding and growth in fish. Such approaches will eventually lead to increased yield in cultured fish.</p>
