<p class="p">It is also interesting to note the species-specific differences in the effect of feeding on the expression of appetite-regulating hormones and the GH-IGF system. Such differences could be related to the feeding behavior of specific fish species, as the carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous fish tend to fall into three different groups of responses. This fact also reflects the flexibility of metabolic systems, considering that the same components present in all fish species could generate distinct responses from the same food stimuli. Therefore, it is critical to bear in mind that results obtained from one species of fish might not apply to another.</p>
