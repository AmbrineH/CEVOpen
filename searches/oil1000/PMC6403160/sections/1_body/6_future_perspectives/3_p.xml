<p class="p">As a final consideration, it would be interesting to broaden our knowledge of the crosstalk between hormones regulating food intake and those regulating growth. For instance, GH and IGF-I not only regulate somatic growth but can at the same time modulate lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, respectively (

 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">222</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">223</xref>). Likewise, it has been shown that leptin directly regulates the expression of IGFs and GHRs in fish hepatopancreas (

These are a few examples of the crosslinks mentioned above, that serve to highlight the close interaction that exists between hormones controlling food intake and growth to ensure the proper growth and development of fish. Thus, comprehensive approaches to determine both metabolic and growth regulatory hormone responses to nutritional challenges are more desirable from an aquaculture perspective. Future research must focus to identify gaps in knowledge, including the ones identified above. In addition, the use of alternate feed ingredients, use of endogenous feeding and growth regulatory factors as feed additives, and employing hormones using targeted molecular and cellular approaches should be explored to modulate growth rate and yield in cultured species.
