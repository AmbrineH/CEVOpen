 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> summarizes the effects of fasting on the expression of components of the GH-IGF system in different fish species. During fasting, growth ceases, and energy is mobilized from tissues to support metabolism. This is mainly mediated by changes in the GH-IGF system: plasma levels of GH generally increase while plasma levels of IGFs decrease (
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>). These changes are explained by a phenomenon known as liver GH resistance, which is characterized by the fact that hepatocytes become resistant to GH, resulting in decreased IGF production despite elevated GH (
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>). These changes in GH-IGF system during fasting could be adaptive jn response to the high GH plasmatic levels together with low levels of IGF-I (and also insulin) induces lipolysis making fatty acids available to peripheral tissues (
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>). Using this mechanism, fish are capable to usually maintain its internal functions during fasting, avoiding somatic growth.
