<p class="p">Dietary protein seems to regulate the hepatic IGF-I expression and secretion, as it was demonstrated in mirror carp (
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>) and Nile tilapia juveniles (
 <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>). In both cases, authors found a significant correlation between dietary protein levels and hepatic IGF-I mRNA expression. Moreover, Qiang et al. (
 <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>) found that the increase in the dietary protein content not only increases the IGF-I mRNA expression but also increases the plasmatic IGF-I levels. These authors also reported a significant correlation between the fish-specific growth rate (SGR) and the IGF-I plasmatic levels and/or IGF-I hepatic mRNA expression. In gibel carp (
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>), it was found that an increase in dietary protein levels leads to an increase in SGR and hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels, although a decrease in both parameters was observed with extremely high protein levels in the diet. Moreover, Tu et al. (
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>) reported that GH mRNA expression in pituitary shows the opposite trend compared to hepatic IGF-I mRNA. Pérez-Sánchez et al. (
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>) found that gilthead seabream fed on low protein diets had significantly higher GH, but lower hepatic GH binding and lower IGF-I levels than fish fed on higher protein diets. This situation resembles the one discussed previously in which fish under fasting shows diminished IGFs production and elevated GH. Therefore, low and very high dietary protein levels may influence the GH-IGF axis through the same mechanism as fasting, possibly by direct control of pituitary hormone secretion by circulating nutrients.
