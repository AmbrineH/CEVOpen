<p class="p">The effect of micronutrients on the expression of GH-IGF system components was not extensively studied. To the best of our knowledge there is only one work reporting an effect of vitamins on 
 <italic class="italic">igf-I</italic> expression (
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">219</xref>). In this, the authors found that 4% of dietary vitamins generate an increase in the IGF-I mRNA expression in sea bass larvae after 38 days of the experiment, compared with diets containing lower or higher amounts.
