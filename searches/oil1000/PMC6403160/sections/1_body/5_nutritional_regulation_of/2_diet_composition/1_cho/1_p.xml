 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>). Several works have been carried out in the past years aiming to determine the effect of dietary carbohydrates, especially glucose, on GH in fish. Rodgers et al. (
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>) demonstrated that when tilapia pituitaries were incubated in the presence of varying glucose concentrations, the quantity of GH released is inversely related to glucose concentration in the culture media. However, Riley et al. (
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>) found no changes in pituitary GH mRNA or plasma GH in response to intraperitoneal (IP) glucose injection. In the liver, IP glucose treatment significantly elevates the levels of GHSR mRNAs. Although the IGF-I mRNA expression was not altered by the IP glucose injection, the IGF-I plasma levels were significantly reduced in tilapia (

 <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>), it was found that incubation of goldfish hepatopancreas with different glucose concentrations significantly increases the expression of

 <italic class="italic">igf-II</italic> mRNAs at 4 h. The increase in GHR and GH mRNAs caused by glucose could be related its insulinotropic effect, as such outcomes were demonstrated in mammals (

 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">208</xref>). Therefore, IGFs seem to play a role in maintaining the balance between GH and insulin to promote normal carbohydrate metabolism.
