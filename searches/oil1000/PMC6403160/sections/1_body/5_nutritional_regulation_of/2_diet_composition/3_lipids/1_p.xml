<p class="p">Dietary lipids have also been shown to modulate fish growth. In several fish species, an increase in the dietary lipid content or a decrease in the protein/lipid ratio was shown to have a negative effect on growth, as reported for the Senegalese sole (
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>), the turbot (
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">213</xref>), and the flounder (
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>). Although a few studies show the effect of dietary lipids on fish growth performance, there is little knowledge on their effect on the regulation of the GH-IGF system. In Senegalese sole, it was demonstrated that an increase in dietary lipid content increases the hepatic IGF-I mRNA expression, and this was inversely correlated with the somatic growth (
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">215</xref>). In pejerrey, an increase from 10 to 21% in the dietary lipid amount generates a decrease in the hepatopancreatic GHR-II mRNA expression, while no changes in somatic growth were found (
 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">216</xref>). In largemouth bass, the effects of different carbohydrates/lipids (CHO/L) ratios on the GH-IGF system, as well as on the somatic growth, were studied. Authors found that CHO/L ratios from 0.32 to 2.36 significantly upregulate GH mRNA expression and downregulate IGF-I mRNA expression. Higher ratios did not exert any further effects on them. A positive correlation between hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels and specific growth rates with varying dietary CHO/LIP ratios was found (
 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>). All these findings indicate that dietary lipid level can differentially regulate the growth endocrine axis, at least at the transcription level. That can be directly associated with the role of these hormones in regulating lipid homeostasis, and particularly with the direct lipolytic effects of GH and the promotion of tissue growth by IGF-I. Moreover, results presented here also indicate that hepatic IGF-I mRNA as well as its plasma abundance could be a reliable index to assess growth and nutritional fitness.
