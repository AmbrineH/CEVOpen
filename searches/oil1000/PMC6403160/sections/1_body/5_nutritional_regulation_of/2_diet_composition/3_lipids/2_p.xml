<p class="p">Several studies have been focused on the effect of fatty acids present in dietary lipids and in the replacement of dietary fish oil by vegetable oil on fish growth. In most of the cases, an increase in the dietary amount of fatty acids from vegetable sources causes an increase in GH mRNA expression and/or circulating levels, while diminishes the IGF-I plasmatic and GHR-I mRNA levels (
