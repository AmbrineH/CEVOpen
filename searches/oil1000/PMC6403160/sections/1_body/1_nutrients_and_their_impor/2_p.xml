<p class="p">Organisms coordinate their growth and development with nutrient level fluctuations in their environment, and therefore they must be able to sense their internal and external nutrient levels (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). In mammals, sensing mechanisms regulate specific processes such as food intake, hormone secretion, and energy expenditure to maintain energy homeostasis (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). The sensing of nutrients may occur directly or indirectly. In the first case, the nutrient molecule binds to its sensor. In the second case, nutrient abundance is detected through a related molecule (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). These detection processes occur in both central and peripheral tissues in fish. At the central level, the brain integrates metabolic information related to nutrient availability, satiety/hunger signals and hormones related to adiposity. As a result of such signal integration, a response is generated in peripheral tissues aiming to modulate the metabolism (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). At the periphery, metabolic regulation by the sensing systems occurs directly or indirectly through the action of endocrine effectors (
