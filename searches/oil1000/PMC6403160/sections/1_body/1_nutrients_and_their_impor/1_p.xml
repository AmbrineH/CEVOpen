<p class="p">Nutrients are organic compounds involved in biochemical reactions that produce energy and are constituents of cellular biomass (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). They are divided into two broad groups: macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are classified into carbohydrates (CHO), proteins and lipids, and are needed in relatively large amounts since they are the primary source to generate the energy organisms require to survive, grow, and reproduce. These nutrients can be stored within the body for later use, or be utilized, leading to the somatic growth of the animal (

The micronutrients comprise of vitamins and minerals and are needed in smaller quantity, although they have several critical roles in cellular processes. The nutritional requirements regarding the composition and proportion of different nutrients present in the diet vary among species and within species, is determined by various extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as environmental conditions, stage of life cycle, sex, and reproductive state (
