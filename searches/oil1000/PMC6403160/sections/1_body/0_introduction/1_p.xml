<p class="p">Physiological processes in fish, as well as in other vertebrates, are subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that act in response to both internal and external signals (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). Signals provided by the environment, along with internal cues are sensed and centrally integrated, providing information about the metabolic status. This enables fish to determine whether conditions are ripe to feed, grow, reproduce and save energy (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Among the external signals that can influence feeding behavior and growth in fish, one of the most important is food (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). Both food availability and food composition exert a critical control of these processes, primarily by acting on the hormones in charge of their endocrine control. The main aim of this review is to summarize the recent advances on the role of feeding and fasting, as well as of dietary macro- and micronutrients, on the regulation of appetite- and growth-regulating hormones in fish. A better understanding of the effects of feeding status and diet composition on the expression and release of those hormones could be beneficial to determine the effects of a specific diet or feeding regime on fish health, growth, and development, which could be crucial in aquaculture. This review will also aim to identify gaps in knowledge and directions for future research regarding this important topic.
