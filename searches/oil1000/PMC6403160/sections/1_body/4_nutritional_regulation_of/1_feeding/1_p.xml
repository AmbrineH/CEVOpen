<p class="p">The nutritional status is an important modulator of appetite-regulating hormones in fish. In this respect, several central and peripheral appetite regulators are affected by a single meal, showing periprandial fluctuations in their expression and/or secretion levels. Brain hormones showing such changes in fish include NPY (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>), orexin (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>), CART (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>), and nesfatin-1 (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>). In general terms, appetite-stimulating or orexigenic factors, including NPY (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>), and orexin (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>), have been shown to display periprandial changes characterized by higher expression levels before or at mealtime, and lower levels post feeding, suggesting that they are hunger signals. By contrast, appetite inhibiting or anorexigenic signals, such as CART (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>), were found to be mainly upregulated after a meal, thus acting as a postprandial satiety signal.
