<p class="p">As for peripheral appetite-regulating hormones, the most studied in terms of periprandial fluctuations have been ghrelin, CCK, PYY, and leptin. Circulating levels of ghrelin (in its acylated form) were found to rise pre-prandially in goldfish (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>), supporting the role of acyl-ghrelin as a meal initiator in this teleost. Consistently, Unniappan et al. (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>) described a significant decrease in total ghrelin in circulation after a meal in goldfish, although this postprandial decrease in plasma ghrelin levels seems to be species-specific as it was detected neither in rainbow trout (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>) nor in Mozambique tilapia (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>). Ghrelin has also been shown to display periprandial fluctuations in terms of gene expression, although different profiles have been described depending on the species [Atlantic cod, (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>); gibel carp, (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>); goldfish, (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>); Mozambique tilapia, (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>); 
 <italic class="italic">Schizothorax prenanti</italic>, (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>); zebrafish, (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>)]. The periprandial changes of CCK have been only studied in terms of its mRNA expression. Although species-specific changes were observed (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>), periprandial variations of 
 <italic class="italic">cck</italic> expression are mainly characterized by an increase in mRNA levels after a meal in the intestine and/or the hypothalamus [dourado, (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>); 
 <italic class="italic">Schizottorax prenanti</italic>, (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>)]. A similar periprandial profile was described for 
 <italic class="italic">pyy</italic> in the hypothalamus of the Mexican blind cavefish (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Schizottorax prenanti</italic> (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>), in the brain of goldfish (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>), and in the brain and gut of Siberian sturgeon (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>). Finally, leptin seems only to vary postprandially, although such variations are species- and tissue-specific. Thus, postprandial increases in 
 <italic class="italic">leptin</italic> mRNA expression has been observed in the brain and liver of the mandarin fish (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>), in the liver of goldfish (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>) and in the visceral adipose tissue of the Atlantic salmon (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>), but not in the brain of goldfish (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>), the brain and intestine of pacu (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>), or the liver of 
 <italic class="italic">Schizothorax prenanti</italic> (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>).
