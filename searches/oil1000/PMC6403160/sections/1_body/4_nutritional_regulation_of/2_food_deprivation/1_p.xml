<p class="p">Food deprivation has been shown to regulate the secretion and expression of appetite-regulating hormones. 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> includes a summary of the available studies within the literature and shows the main effect of fasting periods of different duration on the circulating levels and the mRNA expression of the main appetite regulators in several fish species. In general terms, as expected, fasting has been found to upregulate the levels of orexigens and decrease the levels of anorexigens, but several exceptions have been observed depending on the duration of the fasting period, the tissue analyzed and the species (see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> for results and references). In general an upregulation of orexigens and the GH-IGF system should result in an increase in growth. However, without a complete profile of the redundant endocrine milieu, such conclusions are not valid. In addition, a major limitation of many of the studies is that only mRNA expression was determined. Without understanding more about the peptide synthesis in its major tissue sources, and its levels in circulation, it is difficult to reach conclusions on the effects of nutrient status on these hormones.
