<p class="p">Another nutritional aspect influencing the appetite-regulating hormones is the composition of diets. This is of great importance as there is significant interest in fisheries and aquaculture in modulating fish growth and reproduction by altering diet and/or endocrine milieu. Therefore, it is important to understand the dietary regulation of hormones, as they have remarkable effects on both reproduction and growth. Although the literature available on this is not very large, several studies have described that altering the macronutrient (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, and fat) composition of the diet has significant effects on the secretion and/or expression of appetite-regulating hormones in fish.</p>
