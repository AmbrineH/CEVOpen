<p class="p">Intake of fat-enriched diets has been described to reduce the gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">npy</italic> in the goldfish telencephalon-preoptic area (
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>), and to increase the mRNA levels of 
 <italic class="italic">nucb2/nesfatin-1</italic> in the hypothalamus and liver, and of 
 <italic class="italic">preproghrelin</italic> in the pituitary of goldfish (
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>). Treatment of goldfish intestine with different fatty acids 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> revealed that fatty acids, in general, downregulate NUCB2/nesfatin-1 in the intestine, but only the longer and highly unsaturated fatty acids inhibit preproghrelin (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>). JÃ¶nsson and coworkers showed that rainbow trout fed a normal-protein/high-lipid diet tends to have higher plasma ghrelin levels than those fed a high-protein/low-lipid diet (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>). Apart from the above-mentioned studies, which were all carried out in adult fish, few studies have been performed at larvae or post-larvae state to study the effects of the replacement of the dietary fat source on the expression of metabolic hormones. Bertucci and coworkers demonstrated that the replacement of dietary fish oil with sunflower oil leads to a decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">nucb2/nesfatin-1</italic> mRNA expression in pejerrey larvae (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>). Additionally, it was described that Senegalese sole post-larvae fed with diets containing soybean oil have higher 
 <italic class="italic">cart1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cck</italic> mRNA levels in the brain, but lower peripheral 
 <italic class="italic">cck</italic> levels than larvae fed cod liver oil (
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">180</xref>).
