<p class="p">High-protein diets also modulate important appetite-regulating hormonal systems. A study performed in sea bream revealed that fish fed on high protein diets has higher mRNA expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">preproghrelin</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cck</italic> than those fish fed on diets containing a lower amount of protein (
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>). In goldfish, feeding diets enriched in this type of macronutrient results in a significant increase in 
 <italic class="italic">nucb2/nesfatin-1</italic> expression in the pituitary, and a significant decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">nucb2/nesfatin-1</italic> mRNAs in the gut and in 
 <italic class="italic">preproghrelin</italic> mRNAs in the liver (
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>). Accordingly, expression of both 
 <italic class="italic">nucb2/nesfatin-1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">preproghrelin</italic> was reduced by direct exposure of goldfish intestinal and hepatopancreas fragments to L-tryptophan (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>). Very recently, Volkoff et al. demonstrated that the replacement of dietary fish protein with soy protein does not produce major changes in the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">cart, orexin, cck</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">leptin</italic> in the pacu (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>). Similarly, varying the diet lysine to arginine ratio has been described to not significantly modify the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">npy</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cck</italic> in juvenile cobia (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>). Leucine reduced leptin secretion from the adipocytes of food-restricted rainbow trout (
