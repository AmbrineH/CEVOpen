<p class="p">In fish cells, GH binds to its receptors GHR-I and GHR-II (growth hormone receptor I and II, respectively) to exert its biological actions (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>). GH receptors (GHRs) are widely distributed in tissues, but the primary expression is in the liver (or hepatopancreas). In that tissue, the important response to GH binding its receptors is the release of the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). In other tissues, GHRs also mediate the growth-promoting effects of GH, although the liver is still the place in which GHRs have a significant role in the somatic growth regulation.
