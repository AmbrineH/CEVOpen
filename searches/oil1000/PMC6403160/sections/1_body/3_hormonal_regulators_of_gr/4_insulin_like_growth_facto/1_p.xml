<p class="p">As GHRs, IGF-I and IGF-II are expressed in several tissues, but the main expression is in fish liver. Both factors play a key role in the promotion of cellular proliferation and differentiation in vertebrates (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>–
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>). These and other biological functions of IGFs are mediated by binding to specific transmembrane receptors, present in fish as well as in mammals (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>). Apart from growth, IGF-I has also been associated with fish metabolism, development, reproduction and osmoregulation in seawater (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>). The IGF-II mRNA has been detected in the liver as well as in the brain, heart, kidney, gills, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic islets, skeletal muscle and gonads of fish (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>). The widespread gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">IGF-II</italic> detected by RT-qPCR in both juvenile and adult fish contrasts the findings in mammals, in which its expression seems to be relevant only during the early stages of development (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>). A role in metabolism regulation by IGF-II was demonstrated in muscle cells from trout (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>), indicating that this factor could act as a metabolic hormone in fish. There is evidence that GH regulates 
 <italic class="italic">igf-II</italic> gene in all tissues in fish (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>–
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>), while GH most likely regulates only the expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">igf-I</italic> gene in vertebrates. This situation makes fish an excellent model to study species-specific differences in the growth system.
