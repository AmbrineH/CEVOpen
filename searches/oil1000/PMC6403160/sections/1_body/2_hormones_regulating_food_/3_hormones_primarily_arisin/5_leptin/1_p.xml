<p class="p">Leptin is a 16 kDa protein encoded in chromosome 7. While mammalian leptin is mainly produced by the adipose tissue, the liver appears to be the main leptin production site in fish (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>). The structure of leptin resembles that of growth hormone, belonging to the family of tetrahelical cytokines. In fish, this hormone has been shown to affect adipogenesis (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>), and to increase lipolysis while reducing lipogenesis in liver (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>). Besides this, leptin decreases food intake in several fish species (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>), likely by stimulating the anorexigenic neuropeptides POMC and CART (
