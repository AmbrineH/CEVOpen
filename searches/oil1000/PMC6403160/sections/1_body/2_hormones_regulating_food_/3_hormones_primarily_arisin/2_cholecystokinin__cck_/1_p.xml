<p class="p">CCK is a peptide characterized by a C-terminal tetrapeptide sequence. The structure of pro-CCK consists of three sulfated tyrosine residues, which play a crucial role in the activation of CCK receptors (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>). CCK binds to two receptor subtypes, CCK-A receptor (CCK1) and CCK-B receptor (CCK2), which are primarily localized at the site of the gastrointestinal tract and the brain (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>). In fish, CCK and its cleavage sites suggest that the precursor protein (pro-CCK) is processed into octapeptides and are fully sulfated. CCK plays an essential role in the regulation of feeding, influences digestion and activates satiety signals (
