<p class="p">Ghrelin has been identified in numerous fish species. It consists of 28 amino acids in mammals and has 12 to 25 amino acids in fish depending on the species. The gene encoding the protein was identified within the chromosome 3 and consists of four exons. Ghrelin exerts its physiological functions by binding to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1a (GHS-R1a/ghrelin receptor) (
