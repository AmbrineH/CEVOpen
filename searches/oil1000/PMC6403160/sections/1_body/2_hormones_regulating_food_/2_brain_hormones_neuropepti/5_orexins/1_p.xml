<p class="p">Orexins/hypocretins consist of two orexins, orexin-A, and orexin-B, both cleaved from the same precursor, prepro-orexin (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>). In fish, both the prepro-orexin RNA and the peptides A and B have been shown to be abundant in the hypothalamus (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>), as well as in the gastrointestinal tract (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). Two heptahelical G-protein coupled receptors are known to mediate orexin functions. Orexins have been reported to have a significant role in increasing feeding behavior and locomotor activity (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>), and they were also implicated in the regulation of sleep, energy homeostasis and circadian cycle (
