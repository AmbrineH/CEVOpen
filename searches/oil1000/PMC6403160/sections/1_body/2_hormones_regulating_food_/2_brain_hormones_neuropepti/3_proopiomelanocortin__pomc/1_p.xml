<p class="p">POMC is a 267 amino acid peptide secreted by the hypothalamic neurons located in the arcuate nucleus, as well as the corticotropic cells of the anterior pituitary, the melanotropic cells of the pars intermedia and skin melanocytes (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>). In vertebrates, precursors of POMC has three domains, namely N-terminal pro-γ-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and C-terminal β-lipotropin, which are cleaved by the action of prohormone convertases. The most important of these derivatives are α-MSH, which plays a vital role in suppressing feeding by acting as an agonist at the anorectic MC4R (
