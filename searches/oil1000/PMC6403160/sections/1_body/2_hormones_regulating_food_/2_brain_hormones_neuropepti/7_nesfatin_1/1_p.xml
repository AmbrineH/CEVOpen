<p class="p">Nesfatin-1 is an 82 amino acid peptide originally isolated from the rat hypothalamus and is encoded in the nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2) gene (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>). It is proposed that NUCB2 is cleaved by the prohormone convertases into three different peptides, namely nesfatin-1 (82 amino acids), nesfatin-2 (85–163 amino acids) and nesfatin-3 (166–396 amino acids), respectively. Of all these peptides, nesfatin-1 has been shown to have biological activity. The 30-amino acid mid-segment of nesfatin-1 is considered as the bioactive core and has been shown to affect appetite, the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis, and to modulate intracellular Ca2
