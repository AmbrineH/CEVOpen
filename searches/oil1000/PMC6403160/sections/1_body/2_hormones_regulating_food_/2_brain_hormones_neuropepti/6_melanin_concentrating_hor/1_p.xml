<p class="p">Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a 17 amino acid cyclic peptide, was initially isolated from the brain of chum salmon (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>). Two genes, MCH1 and MCH2, have been identified in zebrafish and pufferfish (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>). The MCH receptor was identified as the GPCR SLC-1, later termed as MCH-R1. MCH-R1 couples to different G-proteins and plays an essential role in activating different signaling pathways. The MCH-R1 is preferentially expressed in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus, areas of the cortex, arcuate and ventromedial nuclei, and olfactory lobes. MCH mainly acts on the melanophores regulating the color change and also lightens the skin in fish. Besides this, MCH seems to have a role in the regulation of feeding, although such a function is still unclear in fish [see Volkoff (
