<p class="p">Neuropeptide Y, a 36 kDa amino acid protein, belongs to the NPY family of peptides, which also includes the pancreatic polypeptide (PNP) and peptide tyrosine (PYY). All these peptides share a common three-dimensional structure composed of polyproline coil and an amphipathic helix. The structure of the neuropeptide Y family is tightened by hydrophobic interactions between prolines and the helix (
