 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). AgRP receptor is highly localized at the site of the paraventricular nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and also in the raphe nucleus, all areas that are highly involved in energy homeostasis. AgRP acts as an orexigenic factor in fish, by antagonizing the activity of MC4R (
