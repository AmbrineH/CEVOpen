<p class="p">The viability of cells was monitored with resazurin. Melanoma cells, B16F10, were seeded in 96-well plate. After 24 h cells treated with different concentrations (0.2-200 Î¼g/mL) of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> extracts, results showed that the extracts had no significant cytotoxic effect on B16F10 cells at the concentrations used in this study (
