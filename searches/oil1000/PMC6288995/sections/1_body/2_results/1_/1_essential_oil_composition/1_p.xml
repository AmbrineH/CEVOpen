<p class="p">Gas-chromatography has been used for quantification and Gc-Mass for identification of the compounds. The results of both GC and GC-MS analysis are presented in the quantitative and qualitative identification table of the compounds. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic>, 68 constituents were identified in the essential oil and accounted for 99.8% of the total oil composition (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The grouped compounds of the essential oil was determined as monoterpene hydrocarbons 86.5%, oxygenated monoterpenes 3.7%, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons 8.7%, oxygenated sesquiterpens 0.1%, and the miscellaneous 0.8%. The major components of the essential oil were β-E-ocimene 29.7%, myrcene 17.1%, β-Z-ocimene 17.0%, α-pinene 10.2%, and E-caryophyllene 7.1%.
