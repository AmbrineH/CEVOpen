 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and other -reactive oxygen species (ROS)- cause cell death and tissue damage in many physiologic and pathologic phenomena including ROS increment following UV irradiation during melanogenesis process. Also it is well known that UV-induced production of ROS is involved in the pathogenesis of several skin conditions including aging, wrinkles, photosensitivity, and malignancy(
