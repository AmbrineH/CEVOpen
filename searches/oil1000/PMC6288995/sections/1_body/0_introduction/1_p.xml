<p class="p">Melanin is a skin pigment which is synthesized in melanosomes and is transferred to keratinocytes throughout the physiological process called melanogenesis. Melanin plays an important role in the protection against UV damage and determines the color of skin, hair and eyes. Excess production of melanin is attributed in melanoma and abnormal pigmentation of the skin(
