<p class="p">In this study the antioxidant activity of different extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> was evaluated and their effects on the tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis were analyzed. The MeOH and EtOAc extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> showed significant antioxidant activity at 2, 20 μg/mL and 20, 200 μg/mL which may be attributed to the polyphenols and flavonoids widely found in the plant. The results showed all of the extracts especially MeOH, EtOAc, and H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O extracts could significantly inhibit the mushroom tyrosinase activity. Also, The MeOH, EtOAc, and BuOH extracts were able to decrease the cellular tyrosianse activity which was in accordance with reduction in the melanin production in cells. In this study, all of concentration of essential oil had no significant inhibitory effect against cellular tyrosianse, melanin synthesis, and antioxidant activity. Due to the more activity of the MeOH extract in different experiment in comparison with other extracts we have chosen the mentioned extract for western blot analysis. To sum up, the anti-melanogenic effect of this extract was confirmed in all assays in B16F10 cells, being comparable to the positive control kojic acid (
