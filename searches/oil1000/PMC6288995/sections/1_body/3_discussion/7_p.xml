<p class="p">Decrease in the protein level of tyrosinase by 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> and antioxidant properties and reduced ROS were confirmed the use of this agent as anti-melanogenesis agent. This study for the first time has determined the inhibitory effect of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> on melanogenesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. In order to prevent accumulation and overproduction of melanin in skin, inhibition of tyrosinase has an important role. Hence, respect to the reported anti-oxidant effect of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic>, flavonoid and phenolic compounds are important components of the plant responsible for anti-melanogenesis and antityrosinase activities of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic>. Both antioxidant and anti-melanogenic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> may offer suitable agent for skin whitening formulations and could be included in cosmetic product for skin care formulations.
