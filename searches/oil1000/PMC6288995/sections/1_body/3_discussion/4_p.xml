 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> are quercetin, luteolin, isoquercetin, rutin, luteolin 7-lactate, and phenolic compounds such as p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid and gallic acid which are responsible for antioxidant activity(
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). Rutin has been reported to inhibit the activity of tyrosinase and is a potent anti-pigment agent due to the presence of hydroxyl groups(
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). Interestingly quercetin, luteolin, and isoquercetin also have many hydroxyl groups in their structure making them suitable for interaction with tyrosinase resulting in the anti-tyrosinase activity(

 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). Recently it has been shown that effect of flavonoids like luteolin and quercetin are mainly mediated via the modulation of transcriptional factor of melanogenesis associated transcription factor (MITF) and/or the melanogenesis enzymes tyrosinase, DCT or tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP-1)(
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). P-coumaric acid and caffeic acid inhibited the mushroom tyrosinase activity and were 10- and 3-fold more potent than kojic acid(
