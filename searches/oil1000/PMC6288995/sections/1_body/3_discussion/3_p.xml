 <sub class="sub">2,</sub> and EtOAc extracts have decreased cellular tyrosinase activity, melanin content, and ROS. Semipolar nature fractions may extract phytochemicals which are responsible for antimelanogenic activity such as polyphenols and flavonoids. The n-hexane fraction and essential oil were less active indicating that plant phytochemicals with nonpolar and volatile nature have not significant effect on the melanogenesis process(
