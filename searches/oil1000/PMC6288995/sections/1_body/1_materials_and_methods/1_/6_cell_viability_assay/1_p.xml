 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> (0.2-200 Î¼g/mL). After 4 h incubation, the absorbance of resazurin and resorufin was measured at 570 nm and 600 nm using H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA). Each experiment was done in triplicate. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
