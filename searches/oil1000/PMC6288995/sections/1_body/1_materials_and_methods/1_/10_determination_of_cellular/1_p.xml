<p class="p">Reactive oxygen species level was measured as described previously with minor modifications(
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). Melanoma cells, B16F10, (2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup>) were seeded in 96-well plates overnight and then were treated with different concentrations (0.2-200 μg/mL) of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> extracts and essential oil for 24 h. Then cells incubated with 50 μL H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(24 mM) at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 50 μL of DCFH-DA were added to the cells and the fluorescence intensity of DCF was measured at 504 nm emission and 524 nm excitation using a Synergy H4 microplate reader (BioTek, USA).
