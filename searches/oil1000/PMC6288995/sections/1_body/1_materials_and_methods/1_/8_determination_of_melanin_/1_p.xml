<p class="p">Melanoma cells, B16F10, were seeded at a density of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> cells per well in 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. They were then incubated with different concentrations (0.2-200 μg/mL) of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> extracts and essential oil for 24 h. The melanin content was measured as described previously(
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). After treatment, the cells were collected using trypsin. They washed with PBS. The cell pellets were solubilized in 50 μL solution of sodium hydroxide (2 M) for 60 min at 60 °C. The melanin content was measured by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm with Synergy H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA).
