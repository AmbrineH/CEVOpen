<p class="p">The activity of mushroom tyrosinase in oxidation of L-DOPA was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously(
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>), with some modifications. Briefly, 160 μL of 5 mM L-DOPA (in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8) and 20 μL of the same buffer with and without

 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> extracts and essential oil (10-1000 μg/mL) were mixed with 20 μL of mushroom tyrosinase (200 units/mL) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 475 nm with Synergy H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA).
