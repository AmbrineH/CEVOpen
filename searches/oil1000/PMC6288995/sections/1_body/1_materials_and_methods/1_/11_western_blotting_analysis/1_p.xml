<p class="p">Melanoma cells, B16F10, were cultured in 75 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> flasks with and without methanol extract (0.5-100 μg/mL) for 24 h. The cells were then lysed in a buffer (50 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% deoxycholic acid sodium salt). Equal amount of proteins (50 μg) were loaded on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked for 2 h in 10% skim milk in TBST (20 mM tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% tween 20) buffer at room temperature. After washing with TBST buffer, the membrane was then incubated overnight with a primary antibody: 1:300 (rabbit anti-tyrosinase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA)). After rinsing 3 times with TBST buffer, the membranes were then incubated for 2 h with anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) as secondary antibody (cell signaling). Rinsing 3 times with TBST buffer was repeated and the protein bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) prime western blotting detection system (BioRaD, USA)(
