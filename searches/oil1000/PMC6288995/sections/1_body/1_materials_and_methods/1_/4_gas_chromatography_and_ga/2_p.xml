<p class="p">Gas-chromatography-mass (GC-MS) analyses were performed using an Agilent 5975 apparatus equipped with a HP-5 MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thicknesses) interfaced with a quadruple mass detector and a computer equipped with Wiley 7n.L library. Oven temperature 50-250 °C with the rate of 3 °C/min, injector temperature 250 °C, injection volume: 0.1 μL, split injection with split ratio of 1:50, with the carrier gas (helium) flow rate 1 mL/min, ion source: 70 eV, ionization current: 150 μA, and scan range: 35-465. Identification of the components of the essential oil was based on retention gas chromatography obtained with reference to n-alkanes series (C6-C20) on HP-5MS column, comparison of their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns reported in literature, and computer matching with the Wiley 7n.L library(
