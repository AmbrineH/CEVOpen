<p class="p">In conclusion, this study for the first time showed that MeOH and EtOAc extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> has strong tyrosinase inhibitory activity which is in accordance with melanin reduction. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> also demonstrated high scavenging activity and antioxidant properties, which could be attributed mainly to its high levels of flavonoids and total polyphenols. The results suggested that the ability of 
 <italic class="italic">P. atlantica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">mutica</italic> to reduce melanin production may correlate to depletion of cellular ROS and its inhibitory action on the signaling pathway regulating tyrosinase activity. Since the semipolar extract had significant anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic effects, therefore, we conclude the compounds responsible for these effects are accumulated in the extract, not in essential oils.
