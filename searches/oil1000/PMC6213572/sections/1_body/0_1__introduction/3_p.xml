 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. It is excellent for deep-fat frying on a continuous basis as it has a balanced saturated-unsaturated fatty acid composition and good oxidative stability. Palm oil also has a significant level of natural antioxidants and has little tendency to form gums and off-flavors [
