<p class="p">Edible oils and fats form an indispensable component of our diet. They provide a large portion of our energy needs, supply essential fatty acids, and act as carriers for fat-soluble vitamins. They also impart special flavor, texture, and taste to our food so that we can pamper our taste buds as we bite into our favorite foods. In many parts of the world, including Malaysia, there is a tendency for oils to be used repeatedly in frying and cooking. During the frying process, many chemical changes occur, such as oxidation, polymerization, and hydrolysis. These chemical changes can lead to the production of oxidized products [

 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. One of these is the accumulation of macrophages and white blood cells promoted by low-density lipoproteins. Inadequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages results in the formation of fatty streaks which ultimately lead to fibrous plaques [
