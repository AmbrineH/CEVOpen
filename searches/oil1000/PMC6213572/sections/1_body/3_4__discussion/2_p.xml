<p class="p">From the obtained results, only the HPO group showed a positive weight gain as opposed to the HCO, HPOC, and HCOC groups, where decreases in body weights were observed. This was consistent with various studies that reported ingestion of highly oxidized oils and their degraded substances resulted in growth retardation and even death [

 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The observed phenomena could be attributed to the fact that heating oils at high temperatures for long periods of time generally results in oxidation, and that the byproducts of oxidation render the feed less palatable. Of the two oils, corn oil is more unsaturated and more prone to oxidation, thus less palatable, possibly leading to decreases in food intake and body weights. This might explain why rabbits from the HCO, HPOC, and HCOC groups were negative in terms of weight gain. The lower body weights could also be attributed to the intake of long-chain polymers that may cause fat to be less absorbed [

 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. This might then interfere with absorption of other fat-soluble nutrients in the diet [

 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Palm olein, on the other hand, has been shown to be more resistant to oxidation. This resistance has been attributed to the higher proportion of tocols in relation to the lower polyunsaturated fatty acid contents [

 <xref rid="B44-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The lower degree of oxidation would then make a palm oil-based diet more palatable than a corn oil-based diet, resulting in higher consumption of the palm-oil based diet. Moreover, this may help explain the differences in weight gain between the groups as was observed in the present study.
