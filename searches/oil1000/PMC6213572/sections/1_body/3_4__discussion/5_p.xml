<p class="p">In this study, plasma antioxidant capacity was measured by two different methods, namely FRAP and ABTS. Results obtained from the ABTS scavenging assay showed no significant differences among the four groups. Using the FRAP analysis, however, the HPO, HPOC, and HCOC groups showed significantly higher antioxidant levels when compared to the HCO group. The different results obtained between the ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> and FRAP methods could be due to the different reaction mechanisms involved. The ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> method is a diammonium salt radical cation scavenging assay, whereas the FRAP method is a ferric reducing power assay [
