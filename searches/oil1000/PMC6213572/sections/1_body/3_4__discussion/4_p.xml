<p class="p">TC levels were comparable between the HPO, HPOC, and HCOC groups. However, the HCO group showed a significantly lower level of TC when compared to the other three groups. This finding was consistent with the fact that corn oil, being an unsaturated vegetable oil, did not raise TC. However, the HCOC diet in which dietary cholesterol was added caused TC levels to double. Palm olein naturally contains equal portions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. It has been reported that saturated fatty acids have been shown to result in an increased in TC [

However, adding cholesterol in the HPOC group did not result in a significant rise in TC. This is postulated to the suppression of endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver by the antioxidant capacity of the oil, resulting in the retardation of further TC increases. Similarly, these observations were made by Idris et al. [

Other lipid parameters (TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C) showed no significant differences in levels among the four dietary groups.
