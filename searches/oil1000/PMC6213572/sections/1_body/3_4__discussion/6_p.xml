<p class="p">In comparing the formation of fibrous plaques, fatty plaques, and fatty streaks between the groups, the corn oil-based diet groups showed a higher percentage in the formation of these lesions when compared to the palm oil-based diet groups. This was in line with the findings by Kritchevsky and Tepper [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], as well as Staprans et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], which showed that heated corn oil was very atherogenic in rabbits. For fibrous plaque formation, the HCO group had the highest percentage of occurrence and this was significant when compared to the HPO, HPOC, and HCOC groups. In the formation of fatty plaques and fatty streaks, however, the HCOC group had the highest percentage of occurrence of these lesions. This finding was expected as other studies have shown that addition of cholesterol in oxidized fats resulted in an overwhelming increase in fatty plaques and fatty streaks in rabbits [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, it was interesting to note that the percentage of all the lesions mentioned was very low in the palm oil-based diet groups, in concordance with the observation made previously by Idris et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Even with the addition of cholesterol to palm oil, the increase in the percentage of lesions in the aorta was minimal. In the present study, rabbits in the HPO group did not exhibit significant differences in their plasma lipid profiles (TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C) in comparison with HPOC group. This was substantiated by insignificant differences in atherosclerotic lesion scores for both groups, signifying the atheroprotective effects of palm oil due to high antioxidant status based on the FRAP assay.
