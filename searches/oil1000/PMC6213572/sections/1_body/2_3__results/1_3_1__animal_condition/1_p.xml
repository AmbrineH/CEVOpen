Of the four groups, only rabbits fed the HPO diet showed an increase in weight gain; this was statistically significant compared to rabbits given the HPOC, HCO, and HCOC diets. The three other groups showed body weight losses, with the highest loss observed in the HCO group, followed by the HCOC and HPOC groups. The HPOC group showed the lowest body weight loss; this was statistically significant when compared to the HPO, HCO, and HCOC groups. Liver weight was the highest in the HPOC group followed by the HPO, HCOC, and HCO groups. However, the weights of hearts showed no significant differences between the four groups. Furthermore, no significant difference was noted in the alanine transaminase (ALT) levels between the groups (
