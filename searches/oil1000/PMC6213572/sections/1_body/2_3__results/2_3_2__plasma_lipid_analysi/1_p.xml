 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-10-01527-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels of rabbits in the four dietary groups. TC level was the lowest in the HCO group, but the highest in the HCOC group. This difference was statistically significant between the two groups. As for the TG levels, no significant difference was found between the dietary groups. Plasma LDL-C level was the highest in the HCOC group, followed by the HPOC, HPO, and HCO groups. However, these differences were also not found to be statistically significant.
