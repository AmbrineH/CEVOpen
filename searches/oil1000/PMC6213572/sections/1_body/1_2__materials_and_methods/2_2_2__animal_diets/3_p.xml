<p class="p">The body weight gain of rabbits was measured weekly. At the end of the experiment, the rabbits were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (50 mg/kg body wt.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body wt). A 30 mL of blood was then drawn by heart puncture for biochemical analysis. All animals were then euthanized with sodium pentothal (100 mg/kg). Subsequently, the anterior chest wall was removed, and the abdominal cavity was opened to reveal the aorta and its branches. These vessels were excised as a unit, and loose adventitial tissue was removed using blunt dissection. The aorta was then opened longitudinally and pinned flat on a paraffin wax. Aorta was preserved in 10% formalin solution before staining with Oil Red-O for quantification of the atherosclerotic lesions.</p>
