<p class="p">Only two oils were used in this study: palm olein (Vesawit, Yee Lee Edible Oils Sdn Bhd, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia) and corn oil (Vecorn, Yee Lee Edible Oils Sdn Bhd, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia). These oils were heated in an electrically heated open fryer (Frymaster, Shreveport, LA, USA) at 180 °C for a total 18 h and nine hours per day, respectively, for two consecutive days. Both the test oils were analyzed for their polar compounds—according to the method of Diefenbaker and Pocklington [
