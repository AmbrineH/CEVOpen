<p class="p">The ability of rabbit plasma to scavenge the ABTS
 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> was measured using the method of Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], as adapted by Balasundram [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In short, this assay measures the ability of antioxidants in the plasma, at the absorbance of 734 nm, to scavenge preformed ABTS

 <sup class="sup">•+</sup> scavenging capacity of the plasma is reported in terms of mg/mL Trolox equivalents (mg/mL TE).
