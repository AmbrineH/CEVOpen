<p class="p">The FRAP assay was carried out using the method documented by Firuzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], as adapted by Balasundram [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The original FRAP assay was developed by Benzie and Strain [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] as a test to measure the ferric reducing ability of plasmaâ€”i.e., the ability to reduce a ferric-2,4,6-tripyridyl-
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>-triazine (Fe
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup>-TPTZ) to ferrous-2,4,6-tripyridyl-
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>-triazine (Fe
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup>-TPTZ) using an electron transfer mechanism. This reduction resulted in the production of an intensely blue colored reduced complex, with maximum absorption at 593 nm [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-01527" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The FRAP value of the plasma is reported in terms of mg/mL Trolox equivalents (mg/mL TE).
