From each treatment, 5 mL of the already cited oil concentrations was sprayed on the plants after verification of the appearance of the disease, and the evaluation of severity of the disease was made every two days, being realized a total of five evaluations after the application of the oil solutions. With the obtained results in the evaluations, the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) was calculated, according to [
