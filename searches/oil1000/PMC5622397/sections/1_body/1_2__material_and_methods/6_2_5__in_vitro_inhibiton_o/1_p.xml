<p class="p">Aiming at verifying the effect of essential oil upon the mycelial growth of the phytopatogen, there was different concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> oil were tested, being: 2.5 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 5 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 7.5 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, 10 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 50 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. As negative and positive control there were prepared the solutions of methyl-thiophanate (2 mg mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) (one for 
 <italic class="italic">C. lunata</italic> and the other for 
 <italic class="italic">Fusarium</italic> sp.) and sterilized distilled water, respectively. There was tested another pathogen in order to verify the efficiency of the proposed fungicide. There was utilized 100 µL from each concentration, distributed on the surface of the culture environment with the aid of a Drigalski spatula. Next, a mycelium-agar disk with 6 mm diameter was put into the center of the plates. The plates were sealed with PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) film, identified and incubated in BOD at 25 °C for 10 days. The evaluations were realized with digital caliper assessing the mycelial diameter of the fungus tracing two orthogonal axes with each other upon the center of the plates resulting in a arithmetic mean and measured every two days (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days).
