<p class="p">The phytoxicity test was realized in greenhouse conditions. There were utilized six polyethylene vases filled with half commercial substrate and half soil. There was added 10 g of fertilizer NPK (5-25-15) in each vase. On the maize plantation there were utilized Traktor (Syngenta
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>) seeds, sowing two for each hole. After sowing, the vases were irrigated daily until the seedlings growth reached four definitive leaves, or 15 days after plantation. Manual sprayers were used for the application of the treatments. There was utilized an entirely casualized design with six treatments and three repetitions, where different concentrations of the
