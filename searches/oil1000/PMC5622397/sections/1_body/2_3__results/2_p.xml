<p class="p">In the phytotoxicity essay, the non-toxic concentrations were applied in the in vivo tests. Phytotoxicity symptoms appeared after 12 h of the application on leaves. It was verified that at the end of 10 days there was phytotoxicity in the concentrations of 7.5 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (5.8%), 10 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (18.1%), and 50 µL mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (20.9%), thus showing that cannot be utilized in tests of control of the disease in the plant, provoking leaf necrosis, followed by posterior wilt. Yet the concentrations 2.5 µL mL

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> did not provoke phytotoxicity along the evaluation (
