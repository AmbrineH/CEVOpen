<p class="p">The chemical composition of the 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> essential oil is described in many studies. Elevated levels of Geranial and Neral in the chemical composition of lemongrass were observed by [
 <xref rid="B22-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], with a mean of approximately 51% and 36%, respectively. The authors [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] also observed similar percentages for Geranial (46.3%) and Neral (31.28%). Yet [
 <xref rid="B24-medicines-04-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] found levels of 43.6% for Neral and 34% for Geranial, values that are different to the ones found on this work, where the highest percentage was of Neral. It is known that many factors, such as extraction method, access and conditions of cultivation may have an influence on the levels of the essential oil components. That can explain the differences found in the present study.
