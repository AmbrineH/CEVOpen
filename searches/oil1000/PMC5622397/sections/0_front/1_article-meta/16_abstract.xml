 <p class="p">The 
  <italic class="italic">Curvularia</italic> Leaf Spot is becoming more common due to the culture expansion and the low resistance of the cultivated genotypes in tropical regions. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the fungitoxicity of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Cymbopogon citratus</italic> upon the phytopathogen 
  <italic class="italic">Curvularia lunata</italic>, causative agent of the 
  <italic class="italic">Curvularia</italic> Leaf Spot. There was realized pathogenicity tests of 
  <italic class="italic">C. lunata</italic> in maize plants, phytotoxicity of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and gas chromatography attached, germination tests of the conidia, and of in vitro inhibition of 
  <italic class="italic">C. lunata</italic>. Also, there were realized tests aiming at verifying the phytopathogen control in vivo. In the pathogenicity tests, there were verified symptoms of the disease in all of the suspensions tested on plants. It was observed that the essential oil concentrations of 7.5 µL mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 50 µL mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> were phytotoxic. The majoritarian chemical components of the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> were Geranial (41.46%) and Neral (32.43%). The concentrations of 5 and 7.5 µL mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> inhibited 100% of conidia germination. None of the concentrations evaluated effectively inhibited 
  <italic class="italic">C. lunata</italic> mycelial growth in in vitro tests. In the preventive control, the concentration of 7.5 µL mL
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was sufficient for the reduction of the progress of the disease, however the curative control was not efficient on the tested dosages.
