 <p class="p">The development of photo-responsive capsules to tune and control the sustained-release of encapsulated actives is a fascinating and challenging route to improve the performances and effectiveness of a wide range of delivery applications. In this work, we report the preparation of visible light-responsive capsules obtained via oil-in-water interfacial polycondensation between modified diacyl-chloride azobenzene moiety and diamine flexible spacer in the presence of cross-linkers with different structures and functionalities. The effect on the release profile of the encapsulated perfume oil was investigated using three flexible spacers with different lengths (1,8-diaminooctane; 1,6-diaminohexane and 1,4-diaminobutane) and two types of cross-linkers (1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride and melamine). We analyzed how the properties of microcapsules can be tailored changing the design of the shell structure. Fine tuning of the perfume release profiles was obtained. The changes in capsules size and morphology due to visible light irradiation were monitored via light scattering, optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Perfume release was 50% faster in the systems prepared with melamine as the cross-linker. Modelling studies were carried out to support the discussion of the experimental results. </p>
