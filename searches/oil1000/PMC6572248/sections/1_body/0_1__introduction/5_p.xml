<p class="p">In this work, we analyzed how the MC properties can be tailored by the precise design of the shell structure. The effect of three flexible spacers with different lengths (1,8-diaminooctane; 1,6-diaminohexane and 1,4-diaminobutane) and two types of cross-linkers (1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride and melamine) on the release profile of the encapsulated perfume oil was investigated.</p>
