<p class="p">Moreover, significant advantages emerge when light, over other external stimuli, is used to induce the release of the microcapsules core material: (1) the fine design of the photo-responsive molecular structure can precisely tune the excitation wavelength; (2) the time and/or local excitation are easy to control; (3) photons have very low or negligible toxicity and do not contaminate the reaction systems in contrast to chemicals (i.e., strong acids; oxidizing agents).</p>
