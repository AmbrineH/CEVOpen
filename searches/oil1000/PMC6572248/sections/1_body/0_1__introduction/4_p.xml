<p class="p">Various methods have been applied to develop such light-sensitive capsules with different functionalities [

 <xref rid="B26-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. One of the most common strategies for the synthesis of photo-responsive capsule shells, is the incorporation of molecular switches, such as azobenzene, stilbene, and other chromophores, into the polymeric shell structure. Azobenzene is one of the most recognized and investigated photochromic molecules. Pioneer studies concerning a functional optical behavior of azobenzene, based on reversible E-Z isomerization of the N=N bond upon photo-irradiation date back to 1930s [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Since then, this moiety has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically [

 <xref rid="B29-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The molecule is nearly planar in its thermally stable E conformation, while when irradiated with UV light (Î» = 365 nm), produces the Z isomer, which has a bent conformation and a much larger dipole moment [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. It has been reported that E-Z isomerization of azobenzene moieties could be caused by mechanical stress or electrostatic stimulation [
 <xref rid="B31-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Furthermore, the process is reversible and thermal Z-E isomerization could occur spontaneously in the dark owing to the thermodynamic stability of the E isomer [
 <xref rid="B32-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. These molecular changes represent a powerful strategy for modulating microcapsule shell structural and functional properties in a controlled way. Various approaches have been performed to develop azobenzene-based photo-sensitive capsules with diverse functionalities [

 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], the modification of the azobenzene molecule with electron donating groups in the ortho position to the N=N bond shifts the E-Z photo-isomerization wavelength to visible light. In a previous paper [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] we reported the preparation of a modified azobenzene with methoxy group in ortho position and the use of this molecule for the preparation of visible light-responsive capsules. MC were prepared employing an oil-in-water (o/w) interfacial polymerization where the shell is formed at or across the surface of oil droplets by polycondensation of reactive monomers: oil-soluble ortho-substituted azobenzene monomer and water-soluble 1,8-diaminoctane and 1,3,5-Triazine-2,4,6-triamine (melamine) employed as a flexible spacer and cross-linker respectively. We demonstrated that the properties of the microcapsule walls and the release of encapsulated perfume oil could be triggered by exposure to visible light.
