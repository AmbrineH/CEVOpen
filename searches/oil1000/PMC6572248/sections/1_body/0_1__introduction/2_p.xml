 <xref rid="B17-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] are only some of the several triggers that have been investigated by scientists during the last decades to boost microcapsule wall morphological changes. Photo-responsive materials for the design of capsules shell are the subject of great interest, as the modification in their micro-/nano-structures occurs when external light is used as a remote-control trigger [
