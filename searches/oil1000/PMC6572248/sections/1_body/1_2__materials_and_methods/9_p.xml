<p class="p">To further elucidate the MC morphological changes under visible light at the nanometric scale, Atomic Force Microscopy analysis was used (AFM) [
 <xref rid="B40-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The AFM studies were carried out by using a MultiMode AFM (Bruker, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with air probe holder (MMEFCH or similar) and Silicon AFM probes for imaging in air, OMCL-AC160TS-W2 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with the following nominal parameters: resonance frequency 300 kHz; spring constant 42 N/m; tip radius of curvature &lt;10 nm, 7 nm. AFM data processing was performed using WSxM software, version 4.0 Develop 5.3 (Nanotec Electronica S.L., Madrid, Spain).
