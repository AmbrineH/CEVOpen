<p class="p">The o/w dispersion was obtained when Sol2, containing the acyl chloride monomer, was added dropwise to Sol1 and homogenized with an overhead stirrer at 1200 rpm for 20 min. Then Sol3, containing the diamine, was added dropwise into the dispersion to start the polycondensation reaction at the interface of the perfume oil droplet. The polycondensation reaction was performed at a stirring rate of 300 rpm for 3 h and stopped by dilution with 50 g of a water solution containing: 6 g of sodium sulfate, 0.350 g of xanthan gum and 43.6 g of demineralized water, to avoid the coalescence of microcapsules. The experiment was carried out at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) in a dark environment.</p>
