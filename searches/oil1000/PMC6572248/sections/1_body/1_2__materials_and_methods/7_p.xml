<p class="p">The photo-sensitive MC were observed by Nikon Eclipse E600 POL Optical Microscope (NIKON CORPORATION, Tokyo, Japan). During morphological observation, the instrument light was filtered with a Red 25 Kodak Wratten Color Filter in order to minimize MC morphology variations caused by the visible light emitted from the microscope bulb. On the other hand, a source of visible light (12V DC, 100 W halogen lamp Philips 7724, Philips North America LLC, Andover, MA, USA) was employed to evaluate light-induced modification in the MC shell. Capsules were irradiated for up to 25 min and then kept in darkness overnight.</p>
