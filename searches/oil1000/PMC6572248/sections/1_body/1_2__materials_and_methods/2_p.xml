<p class="p">As mentioned above, MC were prepared by o/w interfacial polycondensation method, as reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>a. MC1-MC3 capsules were prepared by using 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride (BTC) as the cross-linker (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>c). Due to the acid chloride moieties in the BTC structure and the amine groups in the MEL, theses cross-linkers were dissolved in aqueous and oil phases, respectively. Besides, three different flexible spacers: 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO), 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH), and 1,4-diaminobutane (DAB) were separately used for M1/M4, M2/M5 and M3/M6 capsules walls formation, respectively. Sodium bicarbonate was used to neutralize HCl formed during the capsule wall creation.
