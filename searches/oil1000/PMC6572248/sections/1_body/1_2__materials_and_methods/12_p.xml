<p class="p">Perfume release was also determined using GC-MS and procedure reported in [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. A measured amount (100 µL) of each MC slurry (MC1-MC6) was dried in darkness at 22 ± 2 °C and placed in a vial. Next, after 1 h of incubation in a jacketed reaction vessel at 22 ± 2 °C, the dried capsules were irradiated for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively, as previously described. The amount of released perfume was collected with a manual solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) fiber (1 cm of SPME 75 mm Carbonex TM PDMS Fiber) for 20 s and measured by means of an Agilent 5975C Gas Chromatograph equipped with 5G4513A mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The GC-MS conditions were: 30 m HP-5MS column, initial temperature 45 °C, 1 min, 30 °C/minute, to 80 °C, then 8 °C/minute to 250 °C.
