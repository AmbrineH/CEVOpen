<p class="p">The mean size of the polyamide microcapsule was determined by a Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analysis (LD) using a Helos BR supplied by Sympatec GmbH System Partikel Technik equipped with an R1 cuvette and a Helium-Neon Laser 5 mW max output at 633 nm (Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany). The analysis of 0.1 g of microcapsules slurry was carried out in 50 g of aqueous solution containing 6 g of sodium sulfate and 0.35 g of xanthan gum. Software setup and sample analysis were achieved using the Windox 5.8.0.0 software provided with the equipment by Sympatec, in Free Mode, using Fraunhofer Enhanced Evaluation. The data were collected twice, 5 s each. In order to verify the effect of visible light on the MC size, average capsules diameters were also measured after 3 h of samples irradiation with visible light emitted from a Philips DuraMax 85W 120V desk lamp. The distance between the light source and the quartz cuvette containing dispersed microcapsules was kept constant (approximately 30 cm). During the irradiation processes, cold air stream emitted from a cold air fan (25 ± 2 °C, monitored by means of a type-K thermocouple) was used to keep the capsule’s suspension in a thermostatic environment as shown in
