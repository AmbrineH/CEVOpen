<p class="p">Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observations were performed at −70 °C in order to avoid chamber and detector contamination caused by vacuum-induced perfume release that may occur at room temperature. A Hitachi Model S-5200 Scanning Electron Microscopy (Hitachi High Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Gatan Alto 2500 Cryotransfer System (Gatan Model CT2500, Gatan, Inc. Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used. MC samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen at −210 °C, where the aqueous dispersion phase containing xanthan gum and sodium chloride is frozen forming the bulk mass. Liquid nitrogen fracture was performed to allow the observation of MC cross-section. Image-ProPlus 5 software was employed to analyze capsules dimension.</p>
