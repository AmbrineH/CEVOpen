<p class="p">The BIOVIA Materials Studio program (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to create the bulk polymer in periodic boundary conditions starting off from the coordinates of the molecular models. The unit cell was then optimized by deploying the VAMP module using the Parametric Model 3 (PM3) semi-empirical method by Stewart, while 3-D models were created by using the periodic boundary conditions and an Amorphous cell module. Furthermore, molecular architectures of BTC and MEL were optimized by Molecular architectures BIOVIAâ€™s toolset for engineering efforts.</p>
