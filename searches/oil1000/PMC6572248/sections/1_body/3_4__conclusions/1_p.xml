<p class="p">In this work, photo-sensitive microcapsules, containing a perfume oil, were prepared by oil-in-water emulsion polycondensation of 4,4′-bis(chlorocarbonyl)-2,2′-dimethoxy azobenzene with three diamines with different length and two types of cross-linkers. Experimental studies showed that photo-isomerization of azobenzene moiety induced morphological changes and size decrease of the investigated microcapsules. Modelling studies confirmed that the release of encapsulated perfume not only depends on the incorporation of the photosensitive moieties in the capsule shell but also on the structure and functionality of the crosslinker used for the capsule fabrication. Actually, perfume release was faster in the systems prepared with MEL than BTC. These results suggest that it is possible to tailor the release profile of an encapsulated material by the molecular design of the capsule shell. Moreover, visible light is abundantly available, and it is not cancerogenic like UV light, therefore represents a promising source of energy for light-triggered release platforms in drug release therapy. </p>
