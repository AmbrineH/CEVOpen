 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a) exhibiting planarity, the topographies formed by Z-form were much more geometrically irregular (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the Z-isomer polymers forming the shell occupied less space and were approximately 20 Â± 3% shorter than the E-polymers, assuming total isomeric purity. These modeling studies provide a theoretical explanation for the ca. 16 % decrease of mean microcapsule size diameter after 3 h of irradiation with visible light (see 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00904-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). By comparing structure density before and after irradiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>a,b), it seems that the irradiated microcapsule structures are much denser than prior to light exposure. This is due to the polymer length decrease caused by the E-Z isomerization of azobenzene which also could explain the AFM results. The E-Z photoisomerization of the ortho-substituted azobenzene moiety upon visible light irradiation, included in microcapsules shell, was confirmed by UV-Vis studies.
