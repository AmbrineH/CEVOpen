 <xref rid="polymers-11-00904-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> also reports the MC average size before and after 3 h of their irradiation with visible light. Interestingly, the MC size is not affected by the type of cross-linker or diamine used for microcapsule preparation but seems to be mainly determined by the overhead stirrer speed used for the o/w homogenization. In fact, MC1–MC6 mean capsules diameter, measured by LD, ranged between 62.5 and 68.7 µm. After 3 h of irradiation, the microcapsule size decreased approximately 16% proving that morphological changes are occurring in the shell structure.
