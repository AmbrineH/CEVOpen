<p class="p">Optical microscopy was also used to investigate microcapsule surface changes during irradiation with visible light. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows a single microcapsule’s shape before and after its exposure to visible light emitted from the microscopy bulb for up to 12 min. Before the irradiation, the microcapsule seems to be well-formed with a smooth surface. Then, during the irradiation, it’s surface morphology started to change and appears rough. As a further example, LD studies on MC4 microcapsules slurry demonstrated that after 12 min of irradiation the average microcapsule diameters decrease by 16% from the initial. No further morphological changes were observed after 12 min to 3 h of additional irradiation. Interestingly, after additional 15 h of darkness, a recovery of the original microcapsule’s diameters was observed as well as the investigated single microcapsule surface has turned back to well defined and spherical, like at the beginning of the experiment. As a matter of fact, in our previous modelling studies performed on UV-sensitive microcapsules [

 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], based on unmodified azobenzene and ortho-substituted azobenzene moieties, respectively, we concluded that the decrease of microcapsule size takes place due to E-Z isomerization upon corresponding light irradiation. On the other hand, the capability of the Z-isomer to relax back to its E form over time has been well demonstrated and discussed in the literature [
