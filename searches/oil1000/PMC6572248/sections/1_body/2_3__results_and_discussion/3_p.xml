According to SEM analysis, all obtained microcapsules appeared dispersed, well-formed and spherical, with a dense wall. On further observation, SEM micrographs reveal that some of the microcapsules are coated by an external layer. Indeed, this corresponds to the xanthan gum coating as well as to the crystallized sodium sulfate which were used to avoid capsules agglomeration in the slurries. Therefore, only an approximate shell thickness was measured during the SEM analysis of all slurries, which gave 49 Â± 2 nm. In order to confirm the core-shell structure of prepared microcapsules, optical microscopy studies were employed. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>c shows, a difference between the particle surfaces and their borders was evident.
