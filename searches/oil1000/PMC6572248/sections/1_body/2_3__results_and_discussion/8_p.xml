<p class="p">The next step of the research focused on perfume release characterizations. As evidenced by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>, the n-Ï€* band was mostly centered on the blue-green light region, therefore it was expected that the irradiation with blue-green light results in a large fraction of the Z isomer, and thus in a more efficient release of the encapsulated core. However, our recently generated results on visible-light triggered nanocapsules based on the same ortho-substituted azobenzene moiety [
 <xref rid="B43-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] put into evidence that a higher amount of released active was achieved upon visible/white light irradiation than within green light. For this reason, during current studies, visible light was used for perfume release investigations.
