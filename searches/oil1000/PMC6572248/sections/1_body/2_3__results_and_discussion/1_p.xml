<p class="p">Six types of photo-sensitive microcapsules were synthesized by applying the interfacial polymerization method previously described. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) in samples MC1–MC6 is given in 
 <xref rid="polymers-11-00904-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Obtained results clearly show that the percentage of encapsulated perfume in these slurries is strongly influenced by the type of cross-linker used for microcapsules preparation. About 99.5% of perfume was encapsulated in the capsules prepared with the melamine as the cross-linker (samples MC4-MC6), independently of the type of diamine used for MC wall formation. On the other hand, in samples MC1–MC3, in which BTC was used as the cross-linker, the EE values ranged between 90% and 96% and depended on the length of the diamine employed. Indeed, it can be observed that a higher percentage of encapsulated perfume (EE = 96.0 ± 0.7) was achieved in MC3 where the shorter diamine, DAB, was used as the flexible space; on increasing the length of the flexible spacer, the amount of encapsulated perfume in the MC1-MC3 slurries slightly decreased. It should be taken into account that both families of slurries (MC1–MC3 and MC4–MC6) contain a rigid structured cross-linker; however, in the case of MEL, the azobenzene moiety is directly connected with the crosslinker, while in the case of BTC, a flexible diamine acts as a bridge. Furthermore, in the latter case, the shorter the amine, the better EE was obtained. The obtained results suggest, therefore, that a more rigid structure determines higher encapsulation efficiency. Actually, the highest EE resulted from the rigid MEL-Azo systems.
