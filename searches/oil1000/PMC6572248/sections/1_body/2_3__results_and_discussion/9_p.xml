 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>b provides the percentage of released perfume from the microcapsules formed with melamine as cross-linker and DAO (MC4), DAE (MC5) and DAB (MC6). At the beginning, 10% of perfume was already detected in vial headspaces. From our previous experience, this amount corresponds to perfume released as a consequence of the breakage of more brittle capsules during sample preparation. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows that about 18% of the total encapsulated perfume was released during the first hours of irradiation, then the amount of perfume available in the headspace decreases even upon continuous exposure. These results suggest that the released perfume either escaped the vials or was deposited onto the exterior of the vials. In order to determine the level of free perfume oil deposited on the vial internal surface, at the end of the perfume release experiment from MC4 microcapsules (after 4 h irradiation), 5 mL of hexane was injected to the vial and liquid-liquid extraction was performed, applying the same analytical protocol used for EE tests. The free oil, as measured by extraction, gave a value of 36.8 ± 0.5%. On the other hand, the cumulative amount of free oil released into the headspace, determined by taking the peak headspace value on each hour of measured release by the GC-MS/SPM protocol [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], gave 37.4 ± 0.7%. These two values overlap within the experimental error; therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that, after release, the oil partially deposited onto the vial wall. According to the literature, the mobility and stability of the azobenzene moieties in a polymer film are significantly dependent on the length and the rigidity of the spacers connecting them. On the other hand, it has been reported that when the flexible spacer is of sufficient length, such as 6–8 methylene units, spacer length does not meaningfully impact the alignment of azobenzene group [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Irie et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-polymers-11-00904" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] reported that if the azobenzene moieties are connected in the main chain of the polymer exclusively by flexible spacers, the azo conformational isomerization scarcely affects the shell’s overall conformation. According to the author, in that case, the flexible backbone acts to dissipate strain. Thus, the overall transformation of polymer shape does not occur because the conformational change encouraged by the photo-isomerization is relaxed in the connecting flexible chains. As a consequence, in the case of lightly crosslinked systems, as in our case, the structure and functionality of the crosslinker are expected to be the key factor for effective photo-release. Therefore, the more rigid the structure, the more effective light-triggering should be. Indeed, our results demonstrate that, during the first cycle of irradiation, the capsules containing melamine were able to release the encapsulated perfume faster than those containing BTC. To deepen this aspect for our systems, we performed modeling calculations of shear modulus (known also as modulus of rigidity, SM), which described a coefficient of elasticity for a shearing or torsion force of the molecular architectures. For instance, the calculated SM of BTC-DAE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>a) resulted in lower (SM 905 MPa) than MEL-Azo’s one (SM 1178 MPa, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>b). This difference in rigidity of the two structures could explain why the encapsulated perfume is released 1 h later from MC1-MC3 systems than from MC4-MC6 on photo-irradiation.
