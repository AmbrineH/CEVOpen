<p class="p">In order to follow the microcapsule’s surface topography changes induced by visible light, AFM studies were carried out and specific features in the AFM topographies were analyzed by line profiling routines provided in WSxM software. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a shows the AFM topographic micrographs of MC3 capsule before and after visible light irradiation. Linear scans (x-direction) and topographic analyses (z-direction) were performed between two labeled points A and B. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-00904-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>b, the microcapsule topography surface profiles between the analyzed points were changed after visible light irradiation that clearly indicates morphology modification due to the ortho-substituted azobenzene moiety photo-isomerization. To understand the mechanism of these changes, extensive computational studies were performed. After a successful 4,4’-bis(chlorocarbonyl)-2,2’-dimethoxy azobenzene conformational searching, geometry and energy optimization, the photo-sensitive polymer shell topographies were simulated. Materials studio software allowed building and visualization of surfaces formed by an uncross-linked polymer. We, therefore, wished to set up computational experiments whereby the changes in the geometric structure of polyamide chains incorporated between the cross-linkers can be inspected in the bulk polymer. For that purpose, we created 1-D models using periodic boundary conditions. Computational experiments were set up to monitor any changes in the polymer chains structure between neighboring cross-linker molecules. As a matter of example,
