 </sup> tested SPf66, CS-NANP, RTS,S, MSP/RESA vaccines and their ability to prevent different stages of malaria. Theoretically, SPf66 and MSP/RESA protect against the asexual stages of plasmodium parasites whereas the other two target the sporozoite stages. CS-NANP and MSP/RESA offered no protection against malaria, SPf66 was ineffective and RTS,S reduced malaria episodes by 58%. Unfortunately, vaccines’ mass production and distribution is too expensive for sub-Saharan Africa
