 <italic class="italic">N. cataria</italic>) contained the epimer 4aα,7α,7aβ-nepetalactone and 10 plants of 41 contained 4aβ,7α,7aβ-nepetalactone. A GC-MS measured the composition of the essential oil of

 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-β-ocimene. The differences in catnip oil composition (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) are due to extraction techniques, and environmental and agricultural factors like chemotype, soil, growing region, meteorology, pests, drying and extraction methods, etc.
