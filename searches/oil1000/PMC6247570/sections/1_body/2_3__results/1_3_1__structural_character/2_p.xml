<p class="p">The methanol fraction of the leaf ethanol extract was chromatographed in a silica gel column and a compound was isolated, whose chemical structure was established by 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR analyses. The 
 <sup class="sup">1</sup>H-NMR of this compound showed several peaks in the aromatic region from 6.29 to 8.41 ppm and the 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-NMR spectrum displayed 30 signals in the Csp
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> region, revealing the dimeric flavonoid characteristic. By comparison with literature data [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] it was characterized as amentoflavone, a biflavonoid present in other
