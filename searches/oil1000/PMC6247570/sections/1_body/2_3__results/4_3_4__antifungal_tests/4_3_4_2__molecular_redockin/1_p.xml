Therefore, in the simulation of the molecule redocking, the itraconazole pose was obtained at the active site of the CYP51 protein with the lowest binding free energy of -12.73 kcal/mol, with the approximation of the itraconazole pose in the native conformation of the protein CYP51, being observed in the overlap of the links, lower root mean square deviations, RMSD &gt; 2.0 Ã… [
