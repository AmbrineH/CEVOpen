<p class="p">The glycosylated flavonoid nicotiflorin (kaempferol-3-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-rutinoside), extracted from the seeds, and amentoflavone, a biflavonoid obtained from the ethanol extract of the leaves of
 <italic class="italic"> O. fieldingiana</italic>, displayed antioxidant activity, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In that study, the authors showed the antioxidant activity of several flavonoids and their rutinoside derivatives, O-glycosides, and dimers, deducing that the higher the number of hydroxyls, the greater the antioxidant activity. However, the 3′,4′-dihydroxy system, present in quercetin, used as standard in the study of
 <italic class="italic"> O. fieldingiana</italic>, probably confers greater antioxidant activity on the molecule.
