<p class="p">The wound healing action found for the
 <italic class="italic"> Ouratea</italic> sp. seed oil displays a collagen effect, attributed to the presence of w-6 and w-9 fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The main fatty acid in
 <italic class="italic"> O. fieldingiana</italic> was oleic (43.06%), a w-9 fatty acid, which can contribute to the healing action. In another work, the effect of the anti-inflammatory activity
 <italic class="italic"> O. fieldingiana</italic> seed oil was also associated with the presence of phenolic compounds besides fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The activity of antioxidant compounds in a mixture depends on several physicochemical factors, like the interactions among other antioxidant compounds and with other constituents, such as fatty acids linked to phospholipids or triacylglycerides. Therefore, an individual antioxidant constituent could give limited results when associated with other constituents in a plant extract [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The seed oil of
 <italic class="italic"> O. fieldingiana</italic> is also popularly used for wound healing on the skin. This action can be related to the presence of phenolic compounds with antioxidant and antifungal properties, besides the presence of unsaturated fatty acids.
