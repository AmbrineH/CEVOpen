<p class="p">On the other hand, in the study of drug-protein interaction with the molecular coupling method, it was observed in the simulation of the molecular redocking of the ligand (Itraconazole) with the CYP51 protein of
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans</italic> that coupling was established at the catalytic site of the protein (-12.73 kcal/mol), with a high level of similarity to the CYP51 native structure site, demonstrating reliability in the coupling simulations [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, in the coupling simulation of amentoflavone with the CYP51 protein, it was observed that this compound showed favorable interactions with several residues of the active site of the protein and the group (Hem601). This result demonstrates that amentoflavone is a strong candidate as an antifungal drug, when compared to the Irfan and Abid results [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], where the molecular fit with 18 synthetic antifungal triazole derivatives in the CYP51 protein of
 <italic class="italic"> Candida albicans</italic> showed a free energy range of -9.8 to -7.4 kcal/mol, including the antifungal fluconazole (-8.6 kcal/mol). Moreover, in the present study, low binding energy (-9.39 kcal/mol) was obtained for amentoflavone, CYP51, near to that of fluconazole, which is considered by ANVISA as a drug of choice for the treatment of fungal infections (especially vaginal candidiasis caused by
 <italic class="italic"> Candida</italic> species).
