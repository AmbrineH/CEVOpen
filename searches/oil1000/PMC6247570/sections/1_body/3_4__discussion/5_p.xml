<p class="p">The oil from the seeds of
 <italic class="italic"> O. fieldingiana</italic> fruits presented antibacterial and antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Our study corroborated this action of the oil and extends it to the leaf and branch extracts and the constituents amentoflavone and kaempferol 3-
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>-glucoside, isolated from the leaves and the seeds, respectively, which also display antimicrobial activities, a useful characteristic in the wound healing process. All the extracts and compounds tested showed antifungal activity within the tested range (1000 to 1.95 
 <italic class="italic">Î¼</italic>g/mL) against all isolates, except for the hexane seed extract (SHE). However, the active extracts showed selectivity for the
 <italic class="italic"> C. krusei</italic> isolate. The substances amentoflavone and kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside used in combination showed superior antifungal activity than the extracts alone.
