<p class="p">The search for plants that have antimicrobial and antioxidant properties can lead to relatively nontoxic and cost-effective antifungal products [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. So, using substances with antioxidant properties is a useful way to achieve this goal, since in general good antioxidant plant extracts contain phenolic compounds like flavonoids and organic acids that also display antimicrobial activity. Seeds, leaves, and branches of

These extracts were treated in silica gel chromatographic columns and two flavonoids were isolated. The structure was elucidated by NMR analysis and amentoflavone and kaempferol 3-
