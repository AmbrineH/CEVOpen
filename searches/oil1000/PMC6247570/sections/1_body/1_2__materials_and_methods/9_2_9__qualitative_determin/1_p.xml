<p class="p">The bioassay consisted of application of the samples in TLC plates, which were prepared by mixing of 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB or Ellman's reagent) and a buffer solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI). Subsequently, the AChE enzyme was sprayed and after 3 min the presence of spots (halos) was observed and measured (in mm) on the yellow plate [
