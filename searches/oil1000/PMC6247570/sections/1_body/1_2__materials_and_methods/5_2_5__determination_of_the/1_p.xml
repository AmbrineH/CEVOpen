The equation for the calibration curve of gallic acid was Y = 0.0013X - 0.018, where X is the concentration of gallic acid, Y is the absorbance at 750 nm, and the correlation coefficient R = 0.998. All analyses for calculations of total phenol content were performed in triplicate. The results were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2010 [
