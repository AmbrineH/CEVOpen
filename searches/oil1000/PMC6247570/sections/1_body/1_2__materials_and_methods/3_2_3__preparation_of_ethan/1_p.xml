<p class="p">The plant material was collected and dried in the sun. After drying, 1 kg of leaves and 590 g of branches were obtained, which were shredded in a domestic multiprocessor. The leaves were macerated with 10 L of ethanol PA 96° GL, for seven days at room temperature; then the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure (40 rpm at 60°C) leaving the leaf ethanol extract, LEE (50.82 g). Also, 590 g of branch was placed in 5 L of 96% ethyl alcohol to obtain the branch ethanol extract, BEE (43.43 g), by the same procedure. The LEE and BEE were passed through a filtration column and eluted with the solvents hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol to obtain the respective fractions, LEE (HF: hexane fraction), LEE (CF: chloroform fraction), LEE (EAF: ethyl acetate fraction), LEE (MF: methanol fraction); BEE (HF: hexane fraction), BEE (CF: chloroform fraction), BEE (EAF: ethyl acetate fraction), and BEE (MF: methanol fraction).</p>
