<p class="p">The isolation of compound was performed in an open column chromatography (60 cm length and 3 cm diameter) using silica gel 60 (60–120 mesh size, Merck) as stationary phase, being eluted with solvents hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol in mixtures of increasing polarity. The compounds were visualized by UV detection and/or sprayed with a solution of vanillin/sulphuric acid/EtOH. The 1D and 2D NMR data were acquired with a Bruker Avance DPX-500 spectrometer. Chemical shifts, given on the 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic> scale, were referenced to the residual undeuterated portion of the deuterated solvent CDCl
