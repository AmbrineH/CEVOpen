<p class="p">The geometric arrangement of a given molecule can present structural similarity with other compounds already identified, establishing a correlation in biological activity [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Therefore, the structural data of the amentoflavone molecule were obtained from the PubChem database [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] for analysis of the structural similarity by comparison with the DrugBank database, with similarity limit, ST: 0.7 [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Then a three-dimensional optimization of the conformation of the amentoflavone was prepared using the MarvinSk program [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], with valence checking and geometric analysis of the molecule, to minimize the steric hindrance, and the energy minimization was performed by the MMFF94 force field [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Finally, the theoretical LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the amentoflavone was calculated by the ProTox server [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and the toxicity of the compound was predicted using the Toxin-Toxin target database (T3DB), which presents 3,673 toxins [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>].
