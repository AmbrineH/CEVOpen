<p class="p">The itraconazole linked to the catalytic site of the
 <italic class="italic"> C. albicans</italic> CYP51 (PDB: 5v5z) protein was removed by the PyMOL 2.0 program and then redocked in the autodock Vina, serving as reference for the docking. The molecular docking of amentoflavone was carried by addition Kollman charges [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Also, the chosen program used the protein as input, whereas the amentoflavone molecule was in the flexible form, having greater freedom regarding torsion angles in the search for a favorable conformation [
