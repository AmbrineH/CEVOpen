<p class="p">Several solutions of the extracts of
 <italic class="italic"> O. fieldingiana</italic> were prepared in the following concentrations: 250, 125, 25, 12.5, 1.25, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.025 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. The negative control was a DPPH methanol solution and the positive control was prepared by mixing a standard (quercetin) and DPPH. Methanol solutions of the extracts (100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) were mixed with 3.9 mL of a DPPH solution; then the solutions were stored in the dark for 60 minutes and the reading was performed by spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 515 nm [
