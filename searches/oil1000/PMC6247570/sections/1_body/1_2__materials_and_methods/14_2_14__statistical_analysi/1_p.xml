<p class="p">For each parameter evaluated, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) was calculated. In the case of multiple comparisons between groups, the homogeneity of the variables involved was tested through the Bartlett test. When homogeneity was observed between the variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied, followed by the Tukey test. All conclusions were taken at the significance level of 5% (p &lt; 0.05). The tests were performed in triplicate and the values expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The experiment was completely randomized, where the extracts were the treatments.</p>
