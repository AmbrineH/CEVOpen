<p class="p">Compounds were tested together to ascertain synergism at a concentration range from 2.5 to 0.0049 mg/mL (1:1). An initial inoculum suspension was prepared from 24 h culture of the yeasts to be tested, adjusted to 0.5 on the McFarland scale using Sabouraud dextrose agar. Serial dilutions were then prepared in RPMI 1640 medium to obtain final inocula containing 0.5 to 2.5 x 10
