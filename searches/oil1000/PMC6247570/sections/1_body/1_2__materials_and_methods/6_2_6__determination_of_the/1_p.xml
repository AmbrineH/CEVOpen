<p class="p">Quantification of the flavonoid content of extracts (at the concentration of 2 mg/mL) was performed using 2% aluminum chloride in methanol in a spectrophotometer, with readings at 425 nm. A standard curve was prepared with quercetin. The quercetin calibration curve equation was Y = 0.04215X - 0.0118, where X is the quercetin concentration, Y is the absorbance at 425 nm, and the correlation coefficient R = 0.996. All analyses for calculations of flavonoid content were performed in triplicate. This test was performed in triplicate and followed the method proposed by [
