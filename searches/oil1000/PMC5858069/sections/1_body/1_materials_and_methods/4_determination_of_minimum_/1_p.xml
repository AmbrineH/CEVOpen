<p class="p">To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of essential oils, micro-broth dilution method was used; 5% dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve the essential oils. In addition, 100 μL of fresh culture medium was added to nine wells of each row. These materials were added to the first well to reach a final concentration of 1:200 (v/v) (1 μL of essential oil + 10 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide + 89 μL of the culture medium). Next, 100 μL of the first well was removed and added to the second well and mixed by pipetting up and down ten times. The same was repeated for the next wells and 100 μL of the 7
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> well was discarded (not added to the 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> well). The 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> well served as the positive control (contained bacteria without essential oils) and the 9
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> well served as the negative control (without essential oils or bacteria to control for sterility). Next, 100 μL of microbial suspension was added to the 8
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> well and 100 μL of sterile culture medium was added to the 9
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> well. Serial dilutions of essential oils (1:200, 1:400, 1:800, 1:1600, 1:3200, 1:6400, and 1:12800 v/v) were prepared as follows; 100 μL of 0.5 McFarland standard concentration of the microbial suspension was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 18–24 h. Minimum concentration of essential oil with no turbidity was considered as the MIC. For MBCs with this culture (subculture) of transparent tubes (no growth), MIC test was performed and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) as the concentration that kills 99.9% or more of the initial inoculation is considered.
