 <italic class="italic">Rudbeckia triloba</italic> was collected in August 2016 from particular gardens placed in a limitrophe rural area of Bucharest, Romania (Islaz village, Branesti commune, Ilfov county, latitude: 44.46117°; longitude: 26.38724°; altitude, 70 m; Bucharest distance, 6.92 km). The plant was authenticated at the Bucharest Botanical Garden, where the voucher specimen was deposited (406406/30.03.2017). After collection, the plant material was separated into its principal aerial components: inflorescences, petals, leaves, and seeds which were washed thoroughly with water to remove dust. Then, the vegetable materials were let aside to dry at room temperature. The dried components of the plant were cut into small pieces and kept in paper bags until further experiments.
