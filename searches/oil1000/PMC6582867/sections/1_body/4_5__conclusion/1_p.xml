<p class="p">In conclusion, the current study has demonstrated that
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> essential oils did have a valuable effect on AMPAR kinetics. The effects observed on AMPAR kinetics in these results revealed a decrease in desensitization and deactivation rate, suggesting that
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> essential oils modify the AMPAR gating kinetics in a subunit-dependent manner. Two different mechanisms for the observed effects of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> essential oils on AMPAR kinetics could be proposed, as they might affect AMPAR conformation; first, they might stabilize the desensitized conformation as they slow the kinetics of desensitization. Second, they might similarly stabilize the deactivated form to their effect on desensitization. With the achieved results in this study and the minimal side effects of those oils compared to chemical compounds [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], these oils are very promising for their neuroprotective effects. For future research, all the unique chemical entities found in the
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata </italic>and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> oils would be investigated to establish the most potent compound on AMPARs and see if it can be modified to design a new AMPA-antagonist drug that is effective against specific neurodegenerative diseases. It is apparent that understanding the channel properties of homomeric and heteromeric receptors will generate new possibilities for a mechanism-based inhibitor or drug development to control the function of these channels against neurological diseases.
