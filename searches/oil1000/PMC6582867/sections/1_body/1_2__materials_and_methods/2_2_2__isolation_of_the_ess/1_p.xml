<p class="p">The essential oils of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> were isolated using the ultrasonic-microwave method as described by Jaradat et al. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] with some modifications. Within the isolation procedure, micro- and ultrasonic waves were used on the suspended plant powder to enhance the extraction process. 1 L round-bottom flask containing 100 g of the dried plants powdered materials with 500 ml water was placed in this apparatus. During the isolation process, the power of the ultrasonic-microwave extractor apparatus was set at 1000 W. The isolation process was carried out at 100°C for 15 min and this procedure was repeated several times for the same plant sample. The obtained EOs were collected into a glass bottle and kept at 2-8°C. The average yields for the isolated essential oils of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> were 0.96% and 1.71% v/w, respectively.
