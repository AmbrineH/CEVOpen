 <italic class="italic">HEK293 Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings</italic>. HEK293 cells were recorded 36-48 hours after transfection. Recordings were performed at 22°C, at a membrane potential of -60 mV, using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique via IPA (Integrated Patch Amplifier) (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Membrane currents were digitized using SutterPatch Software v. 1.1.1 (Sutter Instruments) for a short period of time. Sampling frequency was set to 10 kHz, and the low-pass filter was set to 2 kHz. Borosilicate glass was used to fabricate the Patch electrodes with a resistance of 2-4 MΩ. The extracellular solution contained (values are in mM) 150 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The pipette solution contains (values are in mM) 110 CsF, 30 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 Trypsin EDTA solution B (0.25%), EDTA (0.05%), and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. A double barrel glass (theta tube) was used to rapidly apply glutamate and solutions used; the theta tube was mounted on a high-speed piezo solution switcher (Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA). The open tip potentials were recorded during applying solutions of different ionic strengths after expelling the patch from the electrode to estimate the speed of solution exchange. The 10%–90% solution exchange was typically &lt;500 ms. Data acquisition was analyzed using Igor Pro7 (Wave Metrics, inc) [
