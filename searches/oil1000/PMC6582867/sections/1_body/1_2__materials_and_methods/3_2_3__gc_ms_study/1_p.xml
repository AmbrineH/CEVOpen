<p class="p">The chromatograms of the GC-MS were established by utilizing the Shimadzu QP-5000 apparatus. In fact, the GC was equipped with Rtx-5 ms column (0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m thickness, 30 m long, and 0.250 mm internal diameter). The carrier used was helium gas at a standard flow rate of 1 ml per min. The temperature of the injector was programmed at 220°C while the temperature of the oven was adjusted from 50°C (1min hold) at 5°C/min to 130°C and then at 10°C/min to 250°C and then kept isothermally for 15 min. The temperature of the transfer line was set to 290°C. An electron ionization system was used for GC-MS detection, with detector volts of 1.7 KV. A scan speed of 1000 amu/sec and a scan rate of 0.5 s were applied covering a mass range from 38 to 450 M/Z. Using the mass spectrometry data center of the national institute of standards and technology (NIST), the chemical components of the VO were characterized by comparing their MS with the reference spectra in the mass spectrometry data center of NIST; moreover, their Kovats and retention indices were used by comparing them with those in the literature. However, without the use of a correction factor, the quantitative data were electronically obtained from the integrated peaks and area percentages [
