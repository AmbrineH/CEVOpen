<p class="p">QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit was used to prepare up to 20 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g of high-copy plasmid DNA. A selective plate was streaked followed by the selection of a single colony. LB medium was used as a starter culture to be inoculated containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. This was followed by the incubation with vigorous shaking for approximately 8 h at 37°C; 3 ml selective LB medium was then used to dilute the starter culture. The culture was left in the incubator at 37°C for 12–16 h. To harvest the bacterial cells, centrifugation was done followed by the resuspension of the formed pellet with shaking. Subsequently, 0.3 ml of Buffer P2 was added and mixed thoroughly by vigorously inverting the sealed tube 4–6 times. Later, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatant was promptly removed as it contains the plasmid DNA.
