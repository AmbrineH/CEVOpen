<p class="p">The behavior of AMPA receptors is complex and many kinetic schemes were used to model such behavior. High-resolution studies conducted on isolated receptor domains and intact receptors further explain the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors, as they demonstrated the ligand binding domains (LBDs) to close as a “clamshell” after the binding to an agonist. When the ligand binds to the clamshell extracellular structure, a conformational change is triggered in the LBD, which pulls apart the linkers connecting the LBD to the ion channel, opening the channel. Subsequently, conformational changes take place in the dimer interface that breaks contacts between LBDs. This change leads to tension relief of the ion channel linkers, allowing the closure of the ion despite the ligand's high-affinity binding [
