<p class="p">AMPA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that open a transmembrane ion channel in response to glutamate binding, thus, transforming chemical signals into electrical signals. After the ionotropic receptor has been activated, it undergoes one of two processes: either the ligand unbinds the receptor leading to its deactivation or the ion channel pore closes remaining in a ligand-bound state leading to its desensitization [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Namely, deactivation is defined as the natural decay in current after a short simulation time following activation (a fast component of current decay), while desensitization is the natural decay in current after a long simulation time following activation (a slow component of current decay). Both of those biophysical properties can be used as potential targets to treat many neurological disorders.
