<p class="p">The results showed an apparent effect of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> oils on both the deactivation and desensitization of AMPARs. Upon administration of the oils, the time the receptor spent in the desensitized and deactivated phases was increased, demonstrated by a reduction in the value of tau (1/sec.). Hence, both oils reduced the rate of both kinetics on AMPARs, meaning the duration of these states was prolonged, which indirectly reduces the activity of AMPARs. The postsynaptic signal is accounted by not only the number of AMPARs on the postsynaptic neuron but also, in reality, how many of them are available to bind to an agonist. Thus, by prolonging the duration of desensitization/deactivation of AMPA by decreasing the rate of this kinetics, the risk of neurotoxicity is reduced. This suggests that
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> oils might affect the AMPA receptor conformation, stabilizing the desensitized/deactivated conformation instead of the resting state.
