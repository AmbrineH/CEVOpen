<p class="p">Next, the deactivation and desensitization of the receptors were investigated. The deactivation phase represents the fast component of the current decay; thus it is investigated upon rapid application of the agonist and recording the current decay following glutamate removal (1ms). In contrast to the rapid deactivation, the current decay during the sustained application of agonist is how the desensitization, which represents the slow component of the current decay (500ms), was investigated, observing an effect on the kinetics of the desensitization and deactivation of AMPARs.</p>
