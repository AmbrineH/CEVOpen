<p class="p">Essential oils have recently become a source of interest, in response to treating different nervous diseases. The apparent biological effect of EOs on the central nervous system was intriguing to investigate, specifically towards AMPA receptors.
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> oil has a calming effect which could be partially explained by an inhibitory effect on glutamate receptors [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. A study showed
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> to have an affinity to bind to NMDA glutamate receptors and exert inhibitory activity at those receptors, which suggests that
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> might exercise neuroprotection against the glutamate-induced toxicity either by blocking this glutamate-activated ionotropic receptor or by its calcium channel blocking activity [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>].
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> oil was reported to induce neuroprotection in focal cerebral ischemia [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] and effectively reverse spatial learning deficits in Alzheimer's disease patients with significant improvement in performance [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Furthermore, studies on linalool, one of the major components of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> oil, demonstrated its ability to inhibit the binding of glutamate in rats [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Similarly,
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> oil decreases the level of learning and memory impairment of AD model mice [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. It was recently reported that
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> partially protects against seizures [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. These critical effects of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum </italic>oils with the established link between AMPA receptors and such neurodegenerative diseases would predict a similar inhibitory pattern on AMPA receptors.
