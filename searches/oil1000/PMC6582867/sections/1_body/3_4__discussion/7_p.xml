<p class="p">To investigate the effects on AMPAR gating kinetics in a subunit-dependent manner, first the glutamate-evoked peak current generated by AMPA receptors was measured as well as changes with the application of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> oils. The current study did not identify any inhibitory effect of the EOs on the glutamate-evoked peak current generated by AMPA receptors. The results suggest that the EOs did not exert measurable effects on the activation phase time. There was no observed shortening of the activation limb of the AMPA receptor current trace or a statistically significant decrease in the peak amplitude.
