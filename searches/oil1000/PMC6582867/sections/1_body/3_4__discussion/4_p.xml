<p class="p">The focus of this study is to investigate the homomeric, GluA2, and GluA1 channels in addition to the heteromeric GluA1/A2 channels. The abnormal expression of the unedited isoform of GluA2Q due to editing defect was reported in some diseases. Furthermore, GluA2 is an essential AMPA receptor subunit as it controls the permeability of Ca

As for the heteromeric GluA1/A2 channels, it makes up the majority of AMPARs in the mature hippocampus. The time course and amplitude of the little current mediated by AMPA receptor showed that these receptors undergo multiple simultaneous processes including the activation, deactivation, and desensitization of the receptor. The activation of the receptors is the opening of the channel and allows ion influx into the neuron, in response to glutamate binding, thus, transforming chemical signals into electrical signals. After the ionotropic receptor has been activated, it undergoes rapid deactivation or desensitization. Thus, the flow of ions through the channel is terminated by one of those mechanisms.
