<p class="p">AMPA receptors mediate synaptic currents at most excitatory synapses, and such currents play a part in the pathophysiology of the discussed disorders. Thus, synaptic depression is needed to counteract these mechanisms, and this could be achieved by altering the mechanisms by which the flow of ions is terminated in the ion channels by glutamate receptors, namely, deactivation and desensitization. The current study sheds light on the potential both
