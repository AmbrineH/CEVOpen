<p class="p">AMPARs have long been described in the pathology of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, as the overactivation of AMPAR is potently excitotoxic triggering either rapid or delayed neurotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Such diseases include Alzheimer's disease, ALS, stroke, and epilepsy. In ALS, the activation of AMPA receptors leads to the influx of calcium into neurons in toxic levels, leading to the death of motor neurons; it also has been shown that AMPARs expressed in motor neurons are unusually Ca
