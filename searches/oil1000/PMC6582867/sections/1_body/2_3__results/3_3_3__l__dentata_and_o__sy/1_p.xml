<p class="p">To elucidate the biophysical effect of EOs by
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum </italic>oils, the effect of each oil on GluA1, GluA2, and the heteromeric GluA1/A2 was characterized and compared with AMPARs alone. Both oils demonstrated an effect on the desensitization of almost all AMPA subunits. Desensitization is caused by the closure of the ion channel pore while the receptors remain in a ligand-bound state [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In fact, for
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> it reduces desensitization of GluA1, GluA2 homomers, and GluA1/2 heteromers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The average desensitization time of GluA1, GluA2, and GluA1/2 was 3.2 ± 0.1 ms, 2.5 ± 0.1ms, and 5.6 ± 0.6 ms, respectively, while in the presence of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> it was 9.2 ± 0.9 ms, 8.4 ± 0.9 ms, and 28.8 ± 3.2 ms as shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">2(c)</xref>. The average rate (
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>=1/ms) of GluA1 desensitization decreased from 0.31 ms-1 to 0.10 ms-1, ~3.1-fold, GluA2 average desensitization rate decreased from 0.4 ms-1 to 0.11 ms-1, ~3.63-fold, and GluA1/A2 average desensitization rate decreased from 0.17 ms-1 to 0.03 ms-1, ~5.7-fold. Similarly, the
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum </italic>oil affected GluA1 and GluA2, but not GluA1/2 desensitization time, but it was less when compared to
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic>. The average desensitization time in the presence of
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum </italic>was 5.6 ± 0.7 ms, 4.7 ± 0.5ms, and 5.3 ± 0.5 ms, respectively, while the average rate decreased ~1.82-, ~1.88-, and ~0.94-fold, respectively.
