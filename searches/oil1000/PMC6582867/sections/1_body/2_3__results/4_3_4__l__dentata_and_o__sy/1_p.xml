<p class="p">These results motivated the investigation of essential oils on AMPAR deactivation. Deactivation is the characteristic decay in current after a short simulation time following [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>,
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> slows deactivation kinetics of GluA1, GluA2 homomers, and GluA1/2 heteromers, but slightly higher than
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic>. The average deactivation time of GluA1, GluA2, and GluA1/2 was 2.4 ± 0.1 ms, 2.2 ± 0.1 ms, and 2.3 ± 0.1 ms, respectively, while in the presence of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> it was 7.2 ± 0.9 ms, 5.6 ± 0.3 ms, and 8.1 ± 0.8 ms as shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">3(c)</xref>. The average rate of GluA1, GluA2, and GluA1/2 deactivation decreased ~3.2-, ~2.5-, ~3.5-fold, respectively, in the presence of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> oil. Furthermore, the
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum </italic>oil affected GluA1, GluA2, and GluA1/2 deactivation time. Hence, the average deactivation time in the presence of
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum </italic>was 4.5 ± 0.2 ms, 3.8 ± 0.6 ms, and 4.8 ± 0.5 ms, while the average rate decreased to ~1.9-, ~1.7-, and ~2.1-fold, respectively.
