<p class="p">To inquire direct effects of
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum </italic>oils on AMPAR properties, heterologous expression in HEK293 cells and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings were used to compare them. The amplitude generated by the homomeric GluA1Q, GluA2Q, receptors, and the heteromeric GluA1/A2Q receptor was measured using Integrated Patch Amplifiers (IPA), which enables efficient, low-noise whole-cell recordings. Agonist was applied on AMPAR by using Piezo Fast Exchange solution with 10 mM of glutamate. Data were analyzed using Igor 7 software, as shown in
