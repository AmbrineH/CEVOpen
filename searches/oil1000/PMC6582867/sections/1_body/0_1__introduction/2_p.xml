<p class="p">Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Glutamate receptors are classified into metabotropic (mGluRs) and ionotropic (iGluRs) glutamate receptors [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The ionotropic receptors are further subclassified into 
 <italic class="italic">Î±</italic>-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), and Kainate receptor, according to their agonists AMPA, NMDA, and Kainate, respectively [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. AMPAR is responsible for most of the fast-excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system, and they critically contribute to the pathology of many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The function of AMPARs at the synapses relies on the identity of the receptor that is determined by its pore-forming subunits' (GluA1-4) composition. Functional AMPA receptors are assembled into tetramers by one or more distinct subunits and isoforms [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In the mature hippocampus, GluA1/GluA2 (GluA1/2) and GluA2/GluA3 (GluA1/3) combinations make the majority of AMPARs [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. GluA1 is calcium-permeable (without GluA2) and is associated with LTP (long-term potentiation) [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and LTD (long-term depression) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], which affect the synaptic plasticity. Due to its abundance in the human brain, its up- and downregulation have been shown to influence the neuronal function in various diseases [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>].
