<p class="p">Over the years many ligands showing selective competitive inhibitory actions against AMPARs were described [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and efforts to find newer antagonists with enhanced potency, higher specificity, increased water solubility, and longer duration of action continued. To contribute to the evidence-based medicine, the current study investigated essential oils (EOs), which are complex, naturally occurring, volatile compounds synthesized by plants as secondary metabolites, such as French lavender (
