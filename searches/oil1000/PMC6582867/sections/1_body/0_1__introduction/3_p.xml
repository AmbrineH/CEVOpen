<p class="p">The AMPAR subunits that are significant in association with different pathologies are GluA1 and GluA2. GluA1 has essential functions in the synapses including trafficking and insertion of AMPARs. Moreover, in the mature hippocampus, GluA1 is found in the form of GluA1/2 combination, which is impermeable to calcium rather than the GluA1/3 and GluA1 homomeric forms [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. On the other hand, GluA2 is an important subunit as it impacts the biophysical properties of all heteromeric complexes more than all other AMPAR subunits [

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This is significant, due to the association between the excessive cation influx and the previously mentioned nervous pathologies. Several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases have been shown to be associated with excessive activation of AMPA receptors [

However, that type of treatment has modest efficacy and many serious side effects, including Parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, social withdrawal, or even the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, severe neuroleptic sensitivity reactions, and stroke [
