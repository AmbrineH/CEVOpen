<p class="p">In this study, the effects of EOs on different homomeric and heteromeric AMPA subunits were tested by compassing effects on the whole cell current as well as the unique biophysical properties of AMPA. Upon biochemical and electrophysiological analysis, the results revealed that
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> oils distinguishably altered all the studied AMPA subunits' kinetics, both the desensitization and deactivation phases. These results may provide more knowledge on how
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> oils deploy their considerable activities on the central nervous system and against several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.
