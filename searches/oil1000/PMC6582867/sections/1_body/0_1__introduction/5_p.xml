<p class="p">The
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic> essential oil (LEO) was found to have antimicrobial, carminative antispasmodic, antidepressant, antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Oral preparations of LEO exhibit anxiolytic and calming effects with a faster onset of efficacy than first-choice anxiety treatments like serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This calming effect is attributed to LEO's inhibitory effect on the autonomous nervous system (ANS) [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. LEO also has a role in improving cognition, abstract ideas formation, and conceptual understanding of AD patients [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Another study demonstrated LEO's ability to improve memory and cognition for AD rats [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. In addition to its effects on AD, LEO has a positive effect on learning and memory [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], both of which are known to be associated with AMPA glutamate receptors [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. LEO even showed binding affinity to NMDA glutamate receptors with relevant activity on them [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Likewise,
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> has many culinary uses and medicinal purposes. Similar to
 <italic class="italic"> L. dentata</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> has antioxidant, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antispasmodic properties [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. It also has beneficial effects treating several disorders affecting different systems of the body including the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. It decreases the level of learning and memory impairment of AD model mice [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Finally,
 <italic class="italic"> O. syriacum</italic> was recently reported that it partially protects against seizures [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>].
