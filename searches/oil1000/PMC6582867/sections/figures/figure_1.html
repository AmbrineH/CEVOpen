 <p> Effect of L. dentata and O. syriacum oils on the amplitude of the whole-cell current in the absence and presence of both EOs. (A, B, and C) Representative normalized whole-cell current traces of AMPAR recorded upon 500 ms application of 10 mM glutamate to whole-cell recording from HEK293 cells expressing homomeric GluA1 (left), GluA2 (middle), and heteromeric GluA1/2 (right) alone (black) or in combination with O. syriacum (red), L. dentata (blue). </p>
