 <p> L. dentata and O. syriacum oils modify AMPAR deactivation in a subunit-dependent manner. ((a), (b), and (c)) Illustrative normalized current responses of AMPAR recorded upon 1 ms application of 10 mM glutamate (G, indicated above the current trace) to whole-cell recording from HEK293 cells expressing homomeric GluA1 (top), GluA2 (middle), and heteromeric GluA1/2 (bottom) alone (black) or in combination with O. syriacum (red), L. dentata (blue). The whole-cell current recording was conducted at −60 mV, pH 7.4, and 22°C. Graphs summarize weighted time constants for deactivation ( τ W deact). Data shown are mean ± SEM; n= 10–20 patches. Significance (one-way ANOVA): ∗ p &lt; 0.05; ∗∗ p &lt; 0.01; ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.001; ns, not significant. </p>
