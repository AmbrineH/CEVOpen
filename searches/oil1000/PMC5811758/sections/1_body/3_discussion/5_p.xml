<p class="p">Heat-induced and formalin-induced pain models were used in the present study in order to assess the anti-nociceptive effect of 
 <italic class="italic">P. bashagardiana</italic> fruit essential oil in experimental mice. Formalin test consists of two phases; the first phase (neurogenic pain) is caused by direct chemical stimulation of nociceptive afferent fibers, predominantly C fibers, which can be suppressed by opiates like morphine (

The associated effects, observed after using different doses of PBFEO, did not show any significant anti-nociception properties in both phases, compared to the control group. The hot-plate test was also used as a thermal nociception model to define the central anti-nociceptive activity of PBFEO. It did not practically increase the reaction time of animals against the thermal stimulus; even the lowest tested dose induced hyperalgesia. Furthermore, in agreement with the results of the first phase of the formalin test, the essential oil did not display an analgesic effect in contrast to morphine. Thus, it could be concluded that the essential oil does not have anti-nociceptive properties.
