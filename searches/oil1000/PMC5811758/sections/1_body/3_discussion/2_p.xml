<p class="p">In this study, we assessed the antinociception and anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil from the fruits of 
 <italic class="italic">P. bashagardiana</italic>. It is the first report describing the anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic class="italic">P. bashagardiana</italic> fruits in acute and chronic inflammation. Carrageenan-induced edema has been usually presented as an acute inflammation model in the experimental animal. It is well known that carrageenan-induced paw edema is regarded by biphasic episode with the involvement of inflammatory mediators. In the first phase (for the duration of the first 2hr after carrageenan injection), chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin play a role, while in the second phase (3â€“ 4 hr after carrageenan injection) kinins and prostaglandins are implicated (
