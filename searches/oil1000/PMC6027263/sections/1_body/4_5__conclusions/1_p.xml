<p class="p">A preliminary diagnosis can be made after opening brood cells and observations of immature and adult mites present in them or by the biological method “laying nappies”, which reveals, in our study, an initial infestation rate of 11.53%. This rate is close to the range 10 and 20% according to Robaux [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-07-00044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], which means that the colony is strongly affected and requires treatment. This treatment can be done at the level of the hive with various chemicals not without danger since it destroys the mites with negative effects on: the bee, the frames and supports, and the honey. But our study is part of the simple and economical biological method to treat Varroa on the one hand, and collect and observe hive debris and mites for scientific purposes, on the other hand. Itis the method of fumigation treatment using 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic>. It is clear that treatment with Chrea sage reduced the final infestation rate to 10.46, and for the untreated lot, it was 26.4%. Also, statistical analyzes showed that sage essential oil treatments have a significant effect. However, the weakness of the effectiveness of the treatment has its origin in the presence of the capped broods which “protect” the varroa inside the alveoli and thus prevent the penetration of the smoke. In other words, the varroa attached to the lower part of the body of the larva escape, unfortunately, the effects of treatment. Thus, it becomes imperative in our view for beekeepers to ensure the state of the hive before the period of the slope of the eggs to avoid any contamination.
