<p class="p">In this work, we study the acaricidal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> essential oil, which has not been studied so far and comes from the Algiers region, extracted from the leaves of the plant by the hydro-distillation method. The latter allowed us to recover an essential oil yield of 0.56%, which is very low and can be explained by the influence of the region (origin), the sampling period, the climatic conditions, and the method of the extraction.
