<p class="p">The bee is an excellent biological indicator. It signals the state of health of the environment in which it lives. It detects the presence of phytosanitary substances, pollutants such as heavy metals, and radionuclides. It also ensures biodiversity through its role as a pollinator. The bee deserves to be protected.</p>
