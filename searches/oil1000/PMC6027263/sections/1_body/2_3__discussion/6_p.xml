<p class="p">Our results from the anti-mite treatment reveal an effect of the acaricidal activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> L. on the parasitic 
 <italic class="italic">Varroa destructor</italic> of the honey bee 
 <italic class="italic">Apis mellifera intermissa</italic>. This acaricidal activity varies with the dose and the period of exposure to treatment. After treatment, we found that the mortality rate presents a better result when using the dose D1: 5% and that corresponds to 21.07%. This result is weak compared to that of Ghomari et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-07-00044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], who obtained 48.7.20% of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum vulgare</italic>, higher than that obtained by Apivar (3.13%), and much better than that of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris,</italic> described as being disappointing according to Giovenazzol et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-07-00044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Moussaoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-07-00044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] have shown that the toxicity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> bioproduct occurs early.
