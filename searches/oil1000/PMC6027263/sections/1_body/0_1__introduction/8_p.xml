<p class="p">In this work, 
 <italic class="italic">Salvia officinalis</italic> (Lamiaceae) is chosen for its acaricidal effect on the 
 <italic class="italic">Varroa destructor,</italic> parasite of 
 <italic class="italic">Apis mellifera</italic> ssp. 
 <italic class="italic">Intermissa</italic>, in comparison with Apivar, which is a commercial chemical product frequently used in Algeria. Our goal is to study the acaricidal activity of its essential oil as a biological alternative to the biopesticide usually practiced in Algeria.
