<p class="p">We note that the rate of varroa infection estimated after treatment with the essential oil of sage is 6930 individuals living at the expense of 66,250 bees (
 <xref rid="plants-07-00044-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This number is the equivalent of an infestation rate of 10.46%, judged to be above the tolerance threshold established by Colin [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-07-00044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], which is 5%. This result is directly related to the total number of bees in the apiary, which shows that dense colonies prevent the parasite from overgrowth.
