<p class="p">The concentrations of glucose (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) and HDL cholesterol (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) were increased in the childrenâ€™s blood at day 28 of milk supplementation, regardless of the cow diet, and were also higher at 84 days of milk supplementation. Cholesterol concentrations (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) were higher on days 0 and 84 compared to 28 days of milk supplementation. A similar result was observed for triglyceride concentrations (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.037), although there was no difference between days 0 and 28 of milk supplementation. The concentrations of uric acid (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) and urea (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002) were increased with increasing days of milk supplementation, with the highest concentrations observed at 84 days. However, for urea concentrations, there was no difference in those values between collection days 28 and 84.
