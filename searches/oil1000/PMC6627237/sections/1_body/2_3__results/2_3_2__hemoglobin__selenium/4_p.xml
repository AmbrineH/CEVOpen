<p class="p">At 28 and 84 days, there was no difference in the selenium or vitamin E concentrations in the blood of children who consumed milk from cows fed the COANT and OANT diets. When the averages were observed throughout all experimental days, the milk from cows fed different diets had no effects on white cell concentrations (

However, there was no difference in hemoglobin concentrations between children who consumed milk from cows fed the CON, OIL, COANT, and SM diets. Children who consumed milk from cows fed the CON, OIL, OANT, and COANT diets had higher platelet concentrations than the children who consumed the SM diet.
