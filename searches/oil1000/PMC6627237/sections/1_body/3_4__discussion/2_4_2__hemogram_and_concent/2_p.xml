<p class="p">The significant increase in blood concentrations of vitamin E (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) and selenium (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) in children who consumed milk from cows fed the OANT and COANT diets at 28 and 84 days of milk supplementation may be attributed to higher concentrations of these antioxidants in the milk provided (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01218-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The milk produced by the cows fed the COANT and OANT diets presented a 100% increase in selenium concentrations when compared to the milk of the cows fed the CON and OIL diets (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01218-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). As a consequence of the consumption of this milk, the children absorbed more vitamin E and selenium and therefore had higher blood concentrations of vitamin E and selenium after 28 days of milk consumption (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01218-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The increase in vitamin E concentrations in the blood occurred due to the linkage of absorption of fat-soluble vitamins to the digestion of fats, depending on micellar solubilization, and facilitation by pancreatic bile and lipase [

 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] observed increased α-tocopherol concentrations in milk and higher plasma α-tocopherol concentrations in dairy cows fed different levels of vitamin E and fat sources. Regarding the results of selenium, the increase of the mineral in children’s blood represents one of the most commonly used measures to assess the status of selenium in humans [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Selenium concentrations in blood and urine reflect the recent intake of selenium. Selenium content analyses of the hair or nails can also be used to monitor long-term intake over months or years. Quantification of one or more selenoproteins (such as glutathione peroxidase and selenoprotein P) is also used as a functional measure of selenium status [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Plasma or serum concentrations of 8 micrograms (mcg)/dL or more in healthy people usually meet the needs for selenoprotein synthesis [
