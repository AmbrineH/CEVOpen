<p class="p">The hypothesis that cows fed the COANT and OANT diets would have increased concentrations of selenium in their milk and blood was confirmed in this study (
 <xref rid="nutrients-11-01218-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Mean concentrations of selenium in blood and milk of 0.06 and 0.04 μg/mL, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.01), were observed for cows fed the CON and OIL diets, and mean concentrations of selenium in blood and milk of 0.11 and 0.12 μg/mL, respectively, were observed for cows fed the COANT and OANT diets. The objective of this study was to investigate the increase in selenium concentrations in milk, as well as its potential to promote increased protection of the mammary gland against oxidative stress [

 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] supplemented lactating cows with 5 mg of sodium selenite and 1000 IU of vitamin E in the form of alpha tocopherol acetate and obtained a serum concentration of selenium of 0.09 μg/mL in cows, also demonstrating that supplementation with selenium was effective at increasing the concentration of selenium in blood and milk.
