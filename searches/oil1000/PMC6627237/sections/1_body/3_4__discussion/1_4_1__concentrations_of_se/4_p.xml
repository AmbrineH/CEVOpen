<p class="p">Vitamin E is important for health. The main sources of vitamin E are oils and fats, but it is also found in some vegetables, meat fat, poultry, and fish and in lesser amounts in some cereals and dairy products. Charmley et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] found vitamin E concentrations of 1.75 μg/mL and 0.921 μg/mL in cow’s milk when supplemented with 8000 IU of vitamin E and not supplemented, respectively. A very similar value was found in this project, with 1.50 μg/mL in the milk of the cows that received vitamin E supplementation associated with sunflower oil, which would partially meet the daily requirement of vitamin E for children, namely, between 7–9 mg/day. The results confirm that supplementation of cow diets with selenium and vitamin E may increase the levels of these antioxidants in milk and therefore be beneficial to human health.
