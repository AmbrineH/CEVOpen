<p class="p">According to the National Institute of Health, it is recommended that children between the ages of 8 and 13 to receive 40 μg/day of selenium. Welch et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] recommended 55 μg/day of selenium for adults, and the tolerable level is 400 μg/day, as reported by the Institute of Medicine, 2000 [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. According our results, the consumption of 250 mL of milk obtained from cows supplemented with selenium would provide 30 μg/day of selenium, while the milk of cows that were not supplemented would provide 10 μg/day of selenium. Knowles et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-01218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] reported that milk is an important source of selenium and that the intake of 100 g of milk/day can supply more than 10% of the daily requirements of an adult. The concentration of selenium in bovine milk is easy to manipulate, which may be an important way to increase selenium intake by humans. However, strategic supplementation of herds with selenium needs to consider the source of selenium, the dose, and the production system.
