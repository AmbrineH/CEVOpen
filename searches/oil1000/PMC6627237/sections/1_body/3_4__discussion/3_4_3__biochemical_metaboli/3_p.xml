Studies by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2004 showed that early coronary arteriosclerosis is related to high serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) and low serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL). Although no apparent risk for nutrient growth or intake is associated with a diet that meets the requirements, health professionals should evaluate each child individually for total fat intake and investigate excessive consumption of low-fat or fat-free foods. A long-term dietary intervention study demonstrated better lipid concentrations and better eating habits in children with high LDL-cholesterol levels [

In a 3-year interval, dietary total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol were lower in the intervention group than in the usual care group. The dietary behavioral intervention promoted adherence to a diet with 28% of energy from total fat, &lt;8% from saturated fat, up to 9% from polyunsaturated fat, and &lt;75 mg/1000 kcal cholesterol per day [
