<p class="p">We did not observe differences in blood metabolite concentrations in the first sampling (day 0) or at 28 days of milk supply. However, at 84 days, children who consumed milk from cows fed the OIL diet showed higher total cholesterol concentrations (

Although there was no difference between children who consumed milk from cows fed the CON diet and children who consumed skim milk, the children who consumed skim milk did not present serum cholesterol levels that differed from those observed after 84 days of milk supplementation from cows fed the COANT and OANT diets (

The glucose results were within the appropriate reference values (70â€“110 mg/dL), as were results for total cholesterol (&lt;200 mg/dL), triglycerides (&lt;150 mg/dL), HDL (&gt;40 mg/dL), and LDL (&lt;160 mg/dL).
