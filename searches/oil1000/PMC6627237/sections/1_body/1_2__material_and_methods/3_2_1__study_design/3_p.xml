<p class="p">Experiment 2: One hundred children between 8 and 10 years old were used to evaluate the biofortified milk obtained in the experiment one. The children received whole milk, with the exception of only one group who received skim milk. The diets of the children were the same, except the type of milk that were our treatments. At school we had a responsible nutritionist and a nutritionist was also put in place specifically to supervise the preparation of all of the children’s meals. The study was randomized. The treatments had the same composition with the exception of the effect of the antioxidants resulting from the diet of the cows. Cows that received antioxidants in the diet with selenium and vitamin E increased the concentration of these antioxidants in milk, according to the results in

The persons responsible for the children signed a free and informed consent document (FICD), and in the meetings with the parents/guardians to sign the term of participation in the project, the importance of offering the milk at home, at the same times and quantities, was explained. The processed milk was provided to children in a full-time school in the municipality of Casa Branca, São Paulo, Brazil, with follow-up conducted by a nutritionist. Two daily liquid preparations of 250 mL of milk from cows fed different diets were given to the children: (1) milk produced by cows fed the control diet (CON), (2) milk produced by cows fed the sunflower oil diet (OIL), (3) milk produced by cows fed the diet with vitamin E and selenium as antioxidants (COANT), (4) milk produced by cows fed the diet with sunflower oil containing more vitamin E and selenium as antioxidants (OANT), and (5) skim milk (SM).
