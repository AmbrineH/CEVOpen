<p class="p">Experiment 1: Twenty-four Jersey dairy cows (450 ± 25 kg of body weight (BW); 60 ± 30 dry matter intake (DIM); mean ± standard deviation) were used. Jersey cows were chosen because of the high amount of solids in the milk of this breed in order to represent a greater alteration of the concentrations of antioxidants in the biofortified milk. The experimental diets were as follows: CON = control diet; COANT = diet with vitamin E and selenium as antioxidants; OIL = diet with sunflower oil; and OANT = diet with sunflower oil containing more vitamin E and selenium as antioxidants. The experimental period consisted of 14 days of adaptation to the diets, followed by 12 weeks of experimentation. The treatments were defined because selenium and vitamin E are important antioxidants whose concentrations in milk are known to be changeable, and the oil was added to verify if it improves the efficiency of vitamin E, given that vitamin E is a liposoluble vitamin. The diet was a mixture of ingredients (concentrate + corn silage), and consumption was monitored daily by weighing the food before delivery and the leftovers the next day.</p>
