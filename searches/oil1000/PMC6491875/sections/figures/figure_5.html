 <p> Effects of different dietary lipid sources on relative mRNA expression levels of genes related to electron transport chain complex (A) and mitochondrial energy metabolism (B) in the hepatopancreas of juvenile swimming crab. The gene expression level of the positive control group (FO) was set at 1. Letters on the top of columns with the same fill pattern sharing a common letter are not significantly different ( P ≥ 0.05). Significant differences at P &lt; 0.05 (Tukey’s test). nd, NADH dehydrogenase; sdhc, succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit C; cytb, cytochrome b; cox, cytochrome c oxidase; sirt, silent information regulator; nrf1, nuclear respiratory factor. </p>
