 <p> Effects of different dietary lipid sources on relative mRNA expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism including anabolism (A), catabolism (B), transport and uptake (C), and transcription factors (D) in the hepatopancreas of juvenile swimming crab. The gene expression of the positive control group (FO) was set at 1. Letters on the top of columns with the same fill pattern sharing a common letter are not significantly different ( P ≥ 0.05). Significant differences at P &lt; 0.05 (Tukey’s test). fas, fatty acid synthase; acc, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; g6pd, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6pgd, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; lpl, lipoprotein lipase; hsl, hormone-sensitive lipase; cpt, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; fabp1: fatty acid binding protein 1; fatp4, fatty acid transport protein 4; srb2, scavenger receptor class 2; srebp-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1; hnf4α, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha. </p>
