<p class="p">RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed based on the procedures described by 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jin et al. (2017)</xref>. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from hepatopancreas samples with TRIzol reagent (Takara, Japan) following the manufacturer’s protocol and the RNA was treated with RNase-Free DNase (Takara, Japan) to remove DNA contamination. The cDNA was generated from 1000 ng of DNase treated RNA and synthesized by a Prime Script
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan) using Mastercycler nexus GSX1 PCR (Eppendorf, Germany). Real-time quantitative PCR was conducted by a quantitative thermal cycler (Lightcycler 96, Roche, Switzerland). The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence for swimming crab (
