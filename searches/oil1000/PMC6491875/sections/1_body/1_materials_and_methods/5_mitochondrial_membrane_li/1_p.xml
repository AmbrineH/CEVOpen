<p class="p">Total lipids were extracted from mitochondria (10 mg protein) followed the method of Bligh and Dyer with few modifications (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> flow and resuspended in 1 ml CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH/HCOOH (1:1:0.1, v/v/v). The mixture was added 0.5 ml 1 M KCl/2 M H
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and after shaking for 30 s; the mixture was then centrifuged at 4500 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic> for 5 min. Formic acid (HCOOH, ≥98.0%, CAS 64-18-6) and phosphoric acid (H
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>PO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, ≥85.0%, CAS 7664-38-2) were of analytical grade which purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The mixture separated into two layers and the subnatant was transfered to a new tube. Added 0.5 ml CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH (2:1, v/v) to the new tube and the mixture was evaporated to constant weight using a rotating evaporator. The evaporated substance was mitochondrial membrane lipid fatty acid, then collected into the tube, added 200 μl CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH (2:1, v/v) to be dissolved and stored at -20°C for fatty acid analysis. The fatty acid compositions were determined using the method described by 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zuo et al. (2013)</xref> with some modifications. All of the solvents contained 0.005% (w/v) of 
 <italic class="italic">tert</italic>-butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) to prevent the oxidation of PUFAs. Diets (approximately 100 mg) and mitochondrial membrane lipid fatty acid solutions (approximately 100 μl) were thawed at 4°C, then added to a 12 ml volumetric glass screwed tube with lid containing a teflon gasket. Followed by adding 3 ml KOH-CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH (1 N) and heated at 75°C in a water bath for 20 min. After cooling, 3 ml HCL–CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH (2 N) was added and the mixture was incubated at 75°C in a water bath for another 20 min. Previous tests were conducted to ensure that all fatty acids can be esterified. Finally, 1 ml hexane was added into the mixture above, shaken vigorously for 1 min, added 1 ml ultra-pure water to promote layering, and then collected supernatant into the ampoule bottle. The solvent contained the FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters) in the ampoule bottle was reduced to dryness by termovap sample concentrator, and the FAMEs were resuspended in 500 μL of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane and stored at -20°C until used for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. HPLC-grade 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane (≥95.0%, CAS 110-54-3) and the standard mixtures of 37 FAMEs were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, United States). All FAMEs were separated and analyzed on a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) (Agilent-GCMS 7890-5975C; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). The GC column was a capillary HP-5MS column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). The column length was 30 m with an internal diameter of 0.25 mm. The film thickness was 0.25 μm. Mass spectra were scanned from m/z 50–800. Peaks and fatty acids were identified using retention times from standards by comparing the mass spectra with a commercially available standard library (National Institute of Standards and Technology Mass Spectral Library 2011). Results were presented as relative percentages of each fatty acid (% total fatty acids), calculated using the peak area ratio.
