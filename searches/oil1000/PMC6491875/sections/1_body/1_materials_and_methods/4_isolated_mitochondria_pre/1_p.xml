<p class="p">A small fresh portion of the hepatopancreas was used to isolate mitochondria by the method as previously described (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bustamante et al., 1977</xref>). Briefly, the tissue fragments were minced by careful shearing, rinsed to remove residual impurities with normal saline, weighed (≈200 mg), put into an ice-cold isolation buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris–HCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA at pH 7.4, and then gently homogenized at 1000 g for 10 min; the supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellets were collected, washed twice and then resuspended in the isolation buffer. The pellets were stored at -80°C. All of the operations were carried out on ice. The mitochondrial protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).
