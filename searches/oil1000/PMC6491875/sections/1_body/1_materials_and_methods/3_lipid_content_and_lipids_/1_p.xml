 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH (2:1) and evaporation to constant weight with a rotating evaporator (IKA RV10, Germany) according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Folch et al. (1957)</xref>. Methanol (CH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>OH, ≥99.7%, CAS 67-56-1) and chloroform (CHCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, ≥99.0%, CAS 67-66-3) were of analytical grade which purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The triacylglycerol (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) contents in serum were assayed using an automatic biochemistry analyzer (VITALAB SELECTRA Junior Pros, Netherlands). The reagent kits for automatic biochemistry analyzer were purchase from Biosino Bio-technology and Science Inc. (Beijing, China). TG and TC levels in hepatopancreas were determined using Triglyceride GPO-PAP and Cholesterol CHOD-PAP kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations were determined using a commercial assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China) based on a modification of the cholesterol oxidase method described by 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rifai et al. (2000)</xref>. HDL-C and LDL-C reacted with cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol esterase in the presence of chromogens to produce a colored product (

The concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA) in the serum and hepatopancreas were determined using a commercial assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China) by the method of Duncombe. In brief, FFA reacted with copper reagents to form Cu
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> salt, then Cu
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> salt reacted with the chromogen diethyldithiocarbamate to give a yellow color (
