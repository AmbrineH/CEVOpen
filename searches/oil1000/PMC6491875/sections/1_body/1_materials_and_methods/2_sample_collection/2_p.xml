<p class="p">At the end of the experiment, crab in each plastic basket of each replicate was counted and weighted to determine survival, percent weight gain (PWG) and molting ratio (MR). The growth performance are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Hemolymph samples were taken from the pericardial cavity of six crabs in each replicate and using 1-ml syringes, and collected into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. The hemolymph samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4째C by centrifuge (Eppendorf centrifuge 5810R, Germany). Then, the supernatant was collected, packaged, and stored at -80째C until analysis of serum lipid classes. A large portion of the hepatopancreas was collected and stored at -20째C for the determination of lipid content and lipid classes analysis. A small portion of the hepatopancreas was collected, immediately placed in liquid N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and stored at -80째C for gene expression analysis (eight crabs from each replicate). Another small fresh portion of the hepatopancreas was used to isolate mitochondria and further analysis.
