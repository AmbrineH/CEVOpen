<p class="p">In conclusion, swimming crab fed diet supplemented with KO improved lipid metabolism, increased mitochondrial respiration and strengthen energy metabolism of hepatopancreas. Surprisingly, some of these effects were not observed in swimming crab receiving a diet supplemented with FO, emphasizing the influence that the structural form of n-3 PUFAs (esterified to either PL or TAG) has on exerting a biological response. More researches will be needed to find the direct relationships between physiological metabolism and characteristic fatty acid in swimming crab, which can strengthen the exploitation of lipid sources in aquatic feed and deepen the understanding of the physiological metabolism for the fatty acids utilization in swimming crab. These findings could contribute to optimize feeds for swimming crab during its different growth and developmental stages.</p>
