<p class="p">It was reported that different dietary lipid sources affected the expression levels of genes involved in various fatty acid metabolic pathways (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Minghetti et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Martinez-Rubio et al., 2013</xref>). In crustaceans, dietary lipids are mainly assimilated in the hepatopancreas, then being distributed to other tissues through the hemolymph (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Coutteau et al., 1997</xref>). In the present study, significantly higher hepatopancreas lipid deposition in KO group could be partly due to phospholipid (PL) in krill oil. KO contained a high proportion of EPA and DHA, and 30–65% of the fatty acids were esterified in phospholipids (PLs) (mainly phosphatidylcholine) (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ulven and Holven, 2015</xref>). However, fatty acids in vegetable oils and fish oil were mostly esterified in triacylglycerol (TAG) (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ulven and Holven, 2015</xref>). Some researches also reported that lipid deposition increased due to PL supplementation in crustaceans, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Penaeus japonicus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kontara et al., 1997</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Penaeus penicillatus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen and Jenn, 1991</xref>), and 
 <italic class="italic">P. trituberculatus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Another reason was that the high expression levels of genes involved in anabolism, such as 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">acc</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">6pgd</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">g6pd</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">srebp-1</italic> (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ayisi et al., 2018</xref>). Some studies demonstrated that FAS is the main lipogenic enzyme which catalyzes successive condensation reactions to form a fatty acid, playing a key role in energy homeostasis (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). ACC is a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barber et al., 2005</xref>). 6PGD and G6PD are major regulatory enzymes involved in the production NADPH and play a role in the biosynthesis of fatty acid (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). SREBP is a main regulator of fatty acid/lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Menoyo et al., 2004</xref>). The results of anabolic gene expression showed that crabs fed KO diet up-regulated the gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">acc</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">6pgd</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">srebp-1</italic>, which may suggest that KO could promote the anabolism of lipid and increase the lipid deposition in hepatopancreas of crabs. This is probably the major reason that crabs fed KO diet had higher lipid content in hepatopancreas. Indeed, some studies about fish demonstrated that dietary lipid sources could regulate expression levels of genes involved in the anabolic process, such as 
 <italic class="italic">g6pd</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic> (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Menoyo et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Panserat et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morais et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). In one research about spiny lobster, the researchers found that the gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic> was significantly up-regulated by dietary KO and VO compared to dietary FO, which was similar to present study (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shu-Chien et al., 2017</xref>). It was noteworthy that the vegetable oil of previous study about spiny lobster came from linseed and palm oils, which was a blend. The fatty acid composition of VO diet in previous study combines the characteristic of SO and LO diets with the highest levels of LA and ALA. Therefore, similarity in fatty acid composition led to a high expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic> in VO diet (spiny lobster), KO, SO, and LO diets (swimming crab). In addition to anabolism relevant genes, the expression of genes related to the catabolic process could also be affected by dietary lipid sources, such as 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cpt1</italic> (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). LPL is considered as an important factor in lipolysis because it might determine how dietary lipids are partitioned for storage or utilization, and it’s a rate limiting enzyme in the provision of fatty acids (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). The gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> is regulated differentially according to the nutritional state, hormonal levels and the needs of the tissues for fatty acids (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fielding and Frayn, 1998</xref>). The LO and KO diets had a significantly higher expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> than others, followed by SO diet. While, the KO diet had the highest expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">cpt1</italic> and was significantly up-regulated. Moreover, the FFA concentration in serum of crabs fed KO also showed the highest, followed by SO and LO diets, which showed a positive correlation between the FFA concentration and the catabolism.
