 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> compares the lipid classes levels in serum and hepatopancreas of swimming crab fed with different diet supplements. The levels of TG and TC in serum were not affected by different dietary lipid sources (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest level of LDL-C in serum was found in RO diet, while PO diet had the lowest one. The FFA concentrations in serum of crabs fed KO was significantly more abundant than that fed other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Different dietary lipid sources could also significantly affect the lipid classes concentrations in hepatopancreas (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Hepatopancreas TG concentrations in crabs fed diets supplemented with RO and SO were significantly higher than that fed other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The content of TC in FO diet was the lowest, while SO diet had the highest content of TC among all diets. Crabs fed diet supplemented with KO had a high level of LDL-C as well as HDL-C. However, it was found that FO diet had a high level of HDL-C, but a low level of LDL-C. The FFA concentrations in hepatopancreas of crabs fed KO and SO diets were significantly higher than that fed FO and PO (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
