<p class="p">The relative gene expression of some lipid metabolism pathways in the hepatopancreas of juvenile swimming crab including anabolism (A), catabolism (B), transport and uptake (C), and transcription factors (D) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Among genes related to anabolic pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref>), the expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">acc</italic> in crabs fed KO were significantly higher than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The transcript levels of 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">acc</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">6pgd</italic> in crabs fed PO were all the lowest. There were no significant differences in the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">g6pd</italic> in all diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). With regards to the relative expression of genes related to lipid catabolism (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>), the present results showed that the expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">cpt1</italic> were significantly affected by different dietary lipid sources (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), while there were no significant differences in the gene expression of 
 <italic class="italic">cpt2</italic> in all diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Crabs fed KO and LO had significantly higher expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cpt1</italic> appeared in LO and KO diets, respectively, which were both significantly higher than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3C</xref> shows the relative expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport and uptake. Crabs fed KO had significantly higher gene expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">fabp1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">fatp4</italic> than that fed other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">srb2</italic> was up-regulated significantly by dietary FO, KO and SO (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Eventually, the expression levels of genes related to transcription factors are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3D</xref>. The relative expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">srebp-1</italic> in KO and SO diets were significantly higher than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Crabs fed KO had the highest expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">hnf4</italic>Î±, followed by SO diet.
