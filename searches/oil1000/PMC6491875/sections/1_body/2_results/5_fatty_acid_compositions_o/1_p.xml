<p class="p">The major fatty acid compositions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>) (% total fatty acids) and unsaturation index (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>) of mitochondrial membrane lipid in hepatopancreas are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. In general terms, mitochondrial membrane lipid fatty acid profiles reflected the diets, but there were some differences. Each diet had a particularly characteristic fatty acid in mitochondrial membrane. For instance, the percentage of EPA and DHA in crabs fed FO and KO diets were significantly higher than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, KO diet had a significantly higher content of EPA than FO diet (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The maximum value of palmitic acid (PA, 16:0) in mitochondrial membrane was discovered in PO diet. The highest contents of oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9) and Î±-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3) in mitochondrial membrane were found in RO diet and LO diet, respectively. Crabs fed diets containing SO and LO had a significantly higher proportion of linolenic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) than that fed other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>, it was found that the unsaturation index of mitochondrial membrane lipid in FO and KO diets were significantly higher than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
