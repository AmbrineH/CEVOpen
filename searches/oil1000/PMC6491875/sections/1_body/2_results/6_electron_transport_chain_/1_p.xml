<p class="p">The electron transport chain complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref>) and mitochondrial energy metabolism (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref>) in the hepatopancreas of juvenile swimming crab are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>. The gene expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">nd1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">coI</italic> in KO diet were significantly higher than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">coII</italic> appeared in SO diet, and it was significantly higher than other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), followed by FO and KO diets. Besides, the similar trend was found in expression of 
 <italic class="italic">coIII</italic> among all diets. Interestingly, the expression trends of genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism were similar. In brief, crabs fed diet supplemented with KO had significantly higher expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">Atpase6</italic> than that fed other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), followed by SO diet, then FO diet. The gene expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">sirt1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">sirt3</italic> were all significantly up-regulated when crabs fed KO and SO diets, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Crabs fed FO, KO and SO diets had significantly higher expression level of 
 <italic class="italic">nrf1</italic> than that fed other diets (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
