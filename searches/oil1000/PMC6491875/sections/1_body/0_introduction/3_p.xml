<p class="p">Over the last few decades, due to the effective supply of energy and sufficient levels of EFA, especially adequate omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), fish oil (FO) has become the foremost lipid source used in the feed for most species in aquaculture industry including crustaceans traditionally (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tocher, 2015</xref>). However, the global fish oil production may be insufficient to meet future demand in aquaculture owing to sustained reliance on marine fish oil and its own finitude (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Betancor et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the limited supply and the rising demand bringing about rising feed prices in aquaculture industry, environmental pressures to use more sustainable lipid resources, and restrictions on contaminants in feeds demand that, for aquaculture sustainable development, alternative lipid sources to fish oil are required urgently (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tocher, 2009</xref>). The proposed lipid sources includes vegetable oil sources such as palm oil (PO), rapeseed oil (RO), soybean oil (SO), and linseed oil (LO). Also, marine oil especially krill oil (KO), which extracted from Antarctic krill, containing a high proportion of EPA, DHA and astaxanthin, have the potential to be an effective lipid source in aquaculture feed (

However, these lipid sources mentioned above have different fatty acid profiles, thus respond differently to genes involved in lipid metabolism including anabolism and catabolism. The variation in the fatty acid profiles of different lipid sources and diets may result in different reactions through the modulation of gene expression of various lipid metabolic enzymes (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ayisi et al., 2018</xref>). Many key metabolic enzymes and transcriptional factors play crucial roles in lipogenesis and lipolysis, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and many others (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, long chain fatty acid transporters including fatty acid binding protein (FABP) and scavenger receptor B2 (SR-B2) also play a key role in transporting fatty acid (
