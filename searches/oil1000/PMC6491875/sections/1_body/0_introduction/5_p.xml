Thus, we carried out a feeding trial to explore the impacts of the different dietary lipid sources (FO, KO, PO, RO, SO, and LO) on the tissue lipid classes, the expression of some vital lipid metabolism and mitochondrial energy metabolism relevant genes for juvenile swimming crab. This study will provide a novel insight into the influences of dietary lipid sources on the lipid metabolism and energy metabolism in crustaceans.
