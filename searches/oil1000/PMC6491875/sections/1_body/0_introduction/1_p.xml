<p class="p">Hepatopancreas, a key organ for absorption and storage of nutrients in various crustaceans, plays an important role in lipid metabolism, nutritional status and energy storage (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The hepatopancreas stores a large amount of energy-supplying substances, especially lipids, to prepare for energy production and expenditure during molting, starvation, reproduction, limb regeneration, and other life activities (
