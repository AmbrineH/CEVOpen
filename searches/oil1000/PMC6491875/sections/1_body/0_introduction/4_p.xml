<p class="p">Lipids which stored in the hepatopancreas are used to produce energy for molting, starvation, limb regeneration in the growth stage of crustaceans through β-oxidation, a major pathway of fatty acid catabolism takes place in mitochondria and peroxisome in the cells (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tocher, 2003</xref>). Mitochondria, double-membrane-bound organelle which known as “the powerhouse of the cell,” play the most prominent role in producing the energy currency of the cell, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parihar et al., 2015</xref>). Mitochondrial sirtuins which contain three types (namely Sirt3, Sirt4, and Sirt5) are a highly conserved family of proteins and metabolic sensors of cell’s energetic status that regulate cellular physiology and energy demands in response to metabolic inputs, including fatty acid input (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parihar et al., 2015</xref>). These sirtuins regulate mitochondrial metabolic functions mainly through controlling post-translational modifications of mitochondrial protein. Sirt3, the predominant mitochondrial deacetylase, is in charge of the deacetylation in many proteins involved in the pathway of mitochondrial energy metabolism, especially the protein complexes of electron transport chain (ETC) (
