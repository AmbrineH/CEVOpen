<p class="p">GC-MS/FID analysis of essential oils collected from leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">V. capitata, V. megapotamica, V. gardneriana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V. rufescens</italic> (yield of 0.13, 0.18, 0.33, and 0.45%, respectively) determined 46, 45, 41, and 37 constituents to be present, respectively (

 </bold>). Grouping for the species by Euclidian distance based on seven-member ring sesquiterpenes showed clades separating by the production of bicyclogermacrene, aromadendrane and 5,1-cycloaromadendrane sesquiterpenoids, e.g., aromadendrene, viridiflorene, ledol, viridiflorol, 
 <italic class="italic">allo</italic>-aromadendrene, bicyclogermacrene, globulol, 6,9-guaiadiene, spathulenol and palustrol (

 </bold>). We then analyzed the volatile composition of the essential oils from 13 previously published 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species, as well as the four 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species studied here, three of them endemic to Brazil (
 <italic class="italic">V. capitata, V. gardneriana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V. rufescens</italic>) via a clustering algorithm (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). The 17 species comparison showed strong similarities in the production of some monoterpenes, but varied by their production of larger terpenes, especially those with gem-dimethylcyclopropyl subunits on seven-member ring compounds.
