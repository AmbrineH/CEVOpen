<p class="p">Biological activity of some of the prominent compounds we saw in the 
 <italic class="italic">Vitex</italic> species studied here has been defined previously: 6,9-guaiadiene, prominent in 
 <italic class="italic">V. gardneriana</italic>, was also found in essential oils extracted from 
 <italic class="italic">Bracteosa ruilopezia</italic> (Standl.) Cuatrec and 
 <italic class="italic">Baccharis salicifolia</italic> (Ruiz &amp; Pav.) Pers. (Asteraceae)-both oils demonstrated antibacterial activity (

 <italic class="italic">Neoseiulus californicus</italic> (McGregor) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Momen et al., 2014</xref>). Further, α-cadinol and caryophyllene oxide were the main volatile compounds found in essential oil extracted from aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Teucrium polium</italic> L. – Lamiaceae. The essential oil showed fumigant and repellency effects against the cowpea weevil 
 <italic class="italic">Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> F. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) (
