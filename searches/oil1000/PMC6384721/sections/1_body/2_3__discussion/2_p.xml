<p class="p">Comparison of the identified compounds in giant hogweed EO also revealed good accordance with published study. As a major component octyl acetate was previously identified followed by hexyl-2-methylbutyrate, octanol, octyl butyrate, octyl-2-methylbutyrate, hexyl acetate, octyl isobutyrate and hexyl isobutyrate in flowers and fruits, p-cymene in roots, and stems and Î²-guaiene in leaves [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Aliphatic esters were identified as the main group of compounds in EO of giant hogweed from Poland [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-00425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Dominated components in EO identified in giant hogweed from Russia were octyl butyrate (32.0%), octyl acetate (18.0%) and hexyl butyrate (9.2%) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Similar composition of seed EO as in

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">H. mategazzianum</italic> as well as 
 <italic class="italic">H. sosnowskyi</italic> seed EOs that contained mainly octanol and hexanol esters of acetic acid, butyric and isobutyric acids differ from most of the evaluated EOs, in which terpenes dominate.
