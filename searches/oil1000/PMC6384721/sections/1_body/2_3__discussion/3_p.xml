<p class="p">The root elongation response of 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativum</italic> on EO could be generally explained by the hormesis theory. Hormesis can be defined as a biphasic response in which high doses of a toxic agent could cause inhibition of growth while low dose of the same toxic can cause stimulation [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The factors responsible for inducing hormesis are known as hormetins or stressors. In this sense, it has been established that in plants the challenge with different levels of stress constitutes an adaptive process, having reminiscence with the phenomenon of hormesis abovementioned. This stress can be established as “eustress” (beneficial stress) if the effect is similar to the hormetic effect in low doses of a toxin, or “distress” (harmful stress) if the level of this generates an irreversible or negative damage in the plant [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00425" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This explanation could be applied to the different effects visible in 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Triticum aestivum</italic> in evaluation of germination and root elongation.
