<p class="p">Evaluation of seed germination was based on number of germinated seeds from 10 seeds placed into the Petri dish in the beginning of experiment (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00425-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Each EO dose was triplicated. No statistical difference was noted for evaluation seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. sativus</italic> that appeared resistant toward applied concentrations of giant hogweed EO. On the contrary, 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativa</italic> was sensitive to all EO concentrations. All ten seeds were germinated in control Petri dish, while only a slight difference was noted between control and the highest (2.5 μg/mL) and two lower doses (0.25 and 0.125 μg/mL). The number of germinated seeds in mentioned doses decreased from 8.7 ± 0.5 to 7.0 ± 0.8. The highest impact was noted in lowest dose (0.062 μg/mL) where the number of germinated seeds was about 47% lower (5.3 ± 1.3 germinated seeds) comparing to control. Impact of EO on germination of monocotyledonous seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">T. aestivum</italic> was similar to that of lettuce. Statistical significance was noted in three doses (1.25, 0.25 and 0.062 μg/mL) and numbers of germinated seeds were 8.0 ± 0.0, 6.7 ± 0.9 and 6.3 ± 0.9, respectively.
