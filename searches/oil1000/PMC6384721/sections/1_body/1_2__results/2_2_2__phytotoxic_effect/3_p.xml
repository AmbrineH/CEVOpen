<p class="p">More variable effect was noted in evaluation of root elongation after application of EO in different doses (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00425-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Except expected inhibition effect, also stimulation effect was noted. Significant stimulation effects were observed in dicotyledonous model plants. Roots of 
 <italic class="italic">L. sativum</italic> at the lowest EO dose (0.062 μg/mL) were 10% longer in comparison to control. In monocotyledonous model plant 
 <italic class="italic">T. aestivum</italic> the influence was the most significant at the highest dose (2.5 μg/mL) when the roots were 67% longer than in control.
