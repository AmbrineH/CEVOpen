<p class="p">The aims of the study were based on the novel weapon hypothesis. The present study evaluated phytotoxicity of volatiles produced by alien species 
 <italic class="italic">H. mantegazzianum</italic> to model plants. According to our findings, we can conclude that EO hydrodistilled from the alien plant species presented biological activity on the dicot and monocot plant species. The most sensitive was 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> comparing to 
 <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic> in seed germination as well as in root length evaluation. Stimulation effect was visible in both root length and root number at two or one highest doses, respectively in monocot species.
