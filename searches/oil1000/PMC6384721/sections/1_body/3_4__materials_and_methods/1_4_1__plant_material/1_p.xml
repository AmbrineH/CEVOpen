<p class="p">Plant material was collected during the vegetative season 2017 at Lek√°rovce (GPS 48.608129 E 22.140227) in the eastern part of Slovakia. Collection was done in July when the plant was fully maturated. There were collected aboveground parts (whole stems with leaves, flowers and seeds) from different individuals which presented fresh plant material. Plant material was placed on thin layer on filter paper and was left in room temperature approximately 14 days, until all plant material was possible to crumble.</p>
