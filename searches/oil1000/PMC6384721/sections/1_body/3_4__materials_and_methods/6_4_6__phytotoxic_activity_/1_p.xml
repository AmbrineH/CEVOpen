 <italic class="italic">L. sativum</italic> L.), lettuce (
 <italic class="italic">L. sativa</italic> L.) and common wheat (
 <italic class="italic">T.aestivum</italic> L.)] and (ii) six different 
 <italic class="italic">H. mantegazzianum</italic> essential oil concentrations: (2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.062 μg/mL). The essential oils were dissolved in distilled water/acetone 99.5:0.5 and diluted to prepare the desired concentrations. Distilled water/acetone 99.5:0.5 was used as control. Test seeds were surface sterilized in 95% EtOH for 15 s and rinsed thrice in distilled water. Ten sterilized seeds were sown into each Petri dish (90 mm dia) containing 5 layers of Whatman filter paper. In each Petri dish 7 mL of essential oil solutions of different concentration or distilled water/acetone 99.5:0.5 was added. Each treatment was triplicated. The Petri dishes were kept in growth chamber (20 ± 1 °C, natural photoperiod, Sanyo, MLR-351H). Evaluation of germination and the radicle length (cm) was measured after 120 h.
