 <p class="p">Spreading of the plant species in new areas is supported by the hypothesis in which chemicals produced by alien species are allopathic to native plants. A novel weapon hypothesis was tested by using essential oil of dangerous alien species 
  <italic class="italic">Heracleum mantegazzianum</italic> in laboratory conditions. Aboveground plant material was collected in south-east part of Slovakia, dried and hydrodistilled for essential oil isolation. Dominant compounds as octyl acetate (62.6%), hexyl 2-metylbutyrate (10.7%), hexyl isobutyrate (7.5%) and hexyl butyrate (6.5%) were identified by GC-MS. Potential phytotoxic activity was tested on three dicot plant species garden cress (
  <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> L.), radish (
  <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic> L.) and lettuce (
  <italic class="italic">Lactuca sativa</italic> L.) and on one monocot plant species wheat 
  <italic class="italic">Triticum aestivum</italic> L. Germination of the seeds of model plant species after influencing by different doses of essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">H. mantegazzianum</italic> as well as the roots length was evaluated. 
  <italic class="italic">Lepidium sativum</italic> L. and 
  <italic class="italic">Raphanus sativus</italic> L. were generally not sensitive to applied doses of essential oil although a little stimulation effect at some concentrations prevailed over inhibition effect. Similarly, in monocot species 
  <italic class="italic">Triticum aestivum</italic> L., stimulation was visible in both root length and root number at two or one highest doses, respectively.
