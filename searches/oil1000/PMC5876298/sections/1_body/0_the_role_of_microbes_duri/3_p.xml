<p class="p">The DWH oil spill provides a unique opportunity to understand the significant roles that microbes play in the recovery process at oil-polluted environments and to compare different methods for microbial ecological research. In this review, we focus on analyzing and summarizing various methods applied in investigating the responses of microbial communities to the DWH oil spill. These include both culture-dependent methods (i.e., mainly pure culture) and culture-independent methods [i.e., classical molecular biological methods and several advanced methods, including stable isotope probing (SIP), microarray, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and single-cell sequencing]. Additionally, we propose some prevalent methods [e.g., microbial ecosystems metabolic networks (MEMNs) and microbial molecular ecological networks] that exhibit great potential for the future studies.</p>
