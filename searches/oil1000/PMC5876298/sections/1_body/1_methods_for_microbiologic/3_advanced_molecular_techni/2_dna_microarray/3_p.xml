<p class="p">A single chip can be used to analyze thousands of genes in one assay. Therefore, microarrays are becoming one of the major culture-independent identification/quantification methods. However, the microarray technique faces the challenges of natural sequence diversity and potential cross-hybridization in complex environmental bioaerosols (Li and Huang, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Lack of a probe sequence and the complexity of the gene chip's interactive hybridization have been shown to induce low specificity and poor sensitivity of experimental results (Zhou and Thompson, 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Gentry et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>).
