<p class="p">Like DGGE/TGGE, TRFLP, or sometimes T-RLP is another gene fingerprinting technique. By generating a fingerprint for pattern comparison and then complementing the data with a clone library, resolving peaks using a database, and performing multivariate analysis, TRFLP can reveal the differences in unknown microbial communities in various environmental samples (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>). T-RFLP was applied to investigate the composition and succession of bacterial communities after the oil spill and successfully revealed the relatively higher contribution of the bacterial group 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteria</italic>, which is a secondary consumer of methane, oil, or cellular decay products (Redmond and Valentine, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Profiles generated by TRFLP indicated that up to 56% of the total bacteria in plume samples collected in September 2010 were affiliated with 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteria</italic>, whereas this number was only 10–30% when 16S rRNA gene-based clone library techniques were applied (Redmond and Valentine, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In a recent study, the TRFLP analysis for community composition of ammonia oxidizers in salt marshes after the DWH oil spill revealed that exposure to oil, even 2 years post-spill, could contribute to subtle changes in population dynamics of bacterial communities (Bernhard et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Although T-RFLP could provide more authentic data compared to clone libraries, it could still underestimate community diversity, especially when complex and large amounts of data were applied. In the abovementioned study (Redmond and Valentine, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), some terminal restriction fragments could be assigned to multiple groups. Due to the significant overlaps between the 
 <italic class="italic">methanotrophs, methylotrophs</italic>, and some other γ-
 <italic class="italic">proteobacteria</italic>, it was not possible to distinguish the δ-
 <italic class="italic">proteobacteria, Actinobacteria</italic>, and SAR406 clades from each other. Nevertheless, some groups, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteria</italic>, α-
 <italic class="italic">proteobacteria</italic>, and γ-
 <italic class="italic">proteobacteria</italic> could be readily differentiated.
