<p class="p">Dietary carbohydrate and lipid affected the activity levels of enzymes associated with glycolysis (HK, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.040) and lipid uptake (LPL, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001) in the liver irrespective of genotype (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The lowest HK and LPL activities were observed in the fish fed LCHL diet. Similarly, the lowest concentrations of enzymes involved in 
 <italic class="italic">de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis (ACC and FAS) were also found in the fish fed the LCHL diet. Neither genotype nor the dietary carbohydrate and lipid affected PK, PEPCK and HL activity levels. A strain displayed higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.039) levels of LPL activity than the F strain, irrespective of diet.
