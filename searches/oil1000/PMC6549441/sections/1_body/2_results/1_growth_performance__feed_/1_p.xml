<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, feed intake was 24.6% greater (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in F strain compared to A strain. We observed interactions between genotype and diet with respect to FR (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and FE (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The A strain had a higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) FR than the F strain, regardless of the dietary carbohydrate and lipid concentration. In contrast, the FE of the F strain increased with the decreasing concentration of carbohydrate and increasing concentration of lipid. The SGR of the A strain was higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) than that of the F strain, regardless of diet. No interactions were identified in CF, HSI, or VSI, but the HSI of the F strain was greater (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.032) than that of the A strain irrespective of diet (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In addition, fish fed the HCLL and MCML diets had higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.022) HSIs than did the LCHL-fed fish.
