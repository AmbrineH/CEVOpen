<p class="p">The interactions between strain and dietary carbohydrate and lipid had no effects on levels of plasma glucose, NEFA, total cholesterol, or LDL-C (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). The levels of NEFA and LDL-C in the F strain were higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than in the A strain, while fish fed the LCHL diet had lower levels of LDL-C than fish fed the other two diets, irrespective of genotype (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The interaction between strain and dietary carbohydrate and lipid were identified (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) on plasma triglycerides and HDL-C content. The F strain had higher triglyceride (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and HDL-C levels (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.011) than the A strain across all diets, except for HDL-C levels in fish fed the LCHL diet. In the A strain, triglyceride and HDL-C levels did not vary among different dietary carbohydrate and lipid concentration groups. In contrast, triglyceride and HDL-C levels were lowest in the F strain fish fed the LCHL diet. Hepatic triglycerid (TG) and cholesterol levels were affected (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001) by the dietary carbohydrate and lipid concentrations (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>): the highest TG and cholesterol levels were observed in fish fed the HCLL diet, regardless of strain.
