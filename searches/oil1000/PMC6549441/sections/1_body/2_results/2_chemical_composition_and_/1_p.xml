 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.026). The PRE of the A strain was lowest in fish fed the LCHL diet, while the PRE of the F strain was highest in fish fed the LCHL diet. In both strains, LRE declined (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with the decreasing concentration of carbohydrate and increasing concentration of lipid. Fish fed the HCLL diet had higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.030) hepatic lipid levels than fish fed the LCHL group, irrespective of genotype (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). With the decreasing concentration of carbohydrate and increasing concentration of lipid, muscle lipid contents increased in the A strain and decreased in the F strain (
