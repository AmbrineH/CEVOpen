<p class="p">In both strains, transcriptional factor 
 <italic class="italic">srebp1-c</italic> was upregulated in the liver (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.004, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3A</xref>) and the skeletal muscle (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3B</xref>) with the increasing concentration of dietary carbohydrate and decreasing concentration of lipid. Similarly, mRNA expression of

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001) and 
 <italic class="italic">acc</italic> in the muscle (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of both strains increased with the increasing concentration of dietary carbohydrate and decreasing concentration of lipid. The expression of 
 <italic class="italic">acly</italic> in the muscle of the F strain was higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.031) than in the A strain, irrespective of diet. However, the transcriptional expression of 
 <italic class="italic">acc</italic> in the liver and 
 <italic class="italic">fas</italic> in both tissues were not affected by variations among treatments.
