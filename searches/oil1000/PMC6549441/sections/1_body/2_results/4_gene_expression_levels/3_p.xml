<p class="p">The mRNA expression levels of genes associated with hepatic lipolysis (
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic>) and fatty acid oxidation (
 <italic class="italic">ppar</italic>α and 
 <italic class="italic">cpt1a</italic>) did not vary with diet in either strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4A</xref>). However, as compared to A strain, 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ppar</italic>α were more transcriptionally abundant in the muscle (
 <italic class="italic">hsl, P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <italic class="italic">ppar</italic>α, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001) of the F strain, and 
 <italic class="italic">aco3</italic> was more transcriptionally abundant in the liver (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.013) and the muscle (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of the F strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4B</xref>). The mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">atgl</italic> was higher in the muscle of the F strain as compared to the A strain across all diets except for LCHL. In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">atgl</italic> expression in the liver of the A strain was higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.016) than in the liver of the F strain. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> was downregulated (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.012) in the muscle and 
 <italic class="italic">aco3</italic> was downregulated (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.015) in the liver of fish fed the LCHL diet, irrespective of genotype.
