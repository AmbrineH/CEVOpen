<p class="p">Plasma glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), triglycerides, and total cholesterol content were determined using commercial kits (Fujifilm, Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan), following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured using commercial kits (A113-1 and A112-1; Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The activity levels of several hepatic enzymes [i.e., hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL)] were determined using commercially kits (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The enzyme levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were determined using commercially available ELISA kit (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).</p>
