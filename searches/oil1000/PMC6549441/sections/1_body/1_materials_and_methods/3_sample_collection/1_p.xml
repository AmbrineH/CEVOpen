<p class="p">At 8 h after the final feeding, fish were anesthetized in diluted MS-222 (0.06 g L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), counted, batched-weighed, and sampled. Three fish of both strains at the beginning of the experiment and four fish per tank at the end of the experiment were collected and stored at −20°C for body composition analysis. Three fish per tank were randomly selected for the measurement of body weight and body length. The viscera and hepatopancreas were removed from these fish and weighted to calculate conditional factor (CF), viscerosomatic index (VSI), and hepatosomatic index (HSI). Blood samples were collected from an additional two randomly selected fish per tank, using syringes rinsed with heparin sodium (0.2%). After centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min, each plasma sample was immediately frozen and held at −80°C until analysis. The liver and dorsal muscle from these fish were immediately removed on ice, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for posterior analysis.
