<p class="p">All of the data were expressed as the mean of all replicates (n = 6) Â± the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). All of the analyses were performed in SPSS (version 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Taking the different initial body weights of the experimental fish into consideration, a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed, with initial body weight as a concomitant variable. All of the data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variances using the Shapiro-Wilk and Leven tests. The linearity of the relationship between the variable and the covariate, and the homogeneity of each regression slope, was determined before running the ANCOVA. Where appropriate, differences between strains or diets were analyzed using one-way ANCOVAs.</p>
