<p class="p">Two strains of juvenile gibel carp (
 <italic class="italic">Carassius gibelio</italic>) were obtained from the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Wuhan, Hubei, China): A strain (initial body weight: 3.01 ± 0.02 g) and F strain (initial body weight: 6.20 ± 0.00 g). All fish were acclimated in a fiberglass tank in an indoor rearing system for 2 weeks prior to experimentation and were fed a balanced mix of the experimental diets three times per day. At the beginning of the experiment, all fish were fasted for 24 h. Then fish were randomly allocated among the three dietary groups, with triplicate tanks per group and 30 juveniles per tank. Fish were fed to apparent satiation three times daily (at 08:30, 13:30, and 18:30). The daily feed supplied was recorded, and uneaten feed was collected 20 min after feeding, and dried (
