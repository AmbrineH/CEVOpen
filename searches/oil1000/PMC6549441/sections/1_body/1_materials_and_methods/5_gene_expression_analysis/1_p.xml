<p class="p">Total RNAs were extracted from the hepatopancreas and muscle tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), and cDNA was reverse transcribed using an M-MLV First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China), following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on a LightCycler 480 II (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), using SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The expression levels of genes associated with the glucose or lipid metabolisms were determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Specific RT-PCR primers for
