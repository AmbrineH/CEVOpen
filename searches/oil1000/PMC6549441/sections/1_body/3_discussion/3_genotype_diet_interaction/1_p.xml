<p class="p">The interactions between genotype and diet in gibel carp were not identified on growth performance, proximate composition, or appearance. However, the interactions between genotype and diet existed on nutrient retention [i.e., PRE (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and LRE (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.026)]. Higher LRE levels were observed in the F strain, implying greater lipid accumulation in this strain than in the A strain. Interestingly, dietary carbohydrate level was more important for lipid accumulation than dietary lipid concentration. The energy supplied by dietary lipids has been shown to effectively spare protein in many fish species (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). Thus, increasing lipid contents may provide adequate energy for the F strain, reducing protein catabolism and contributing to the higher PRE observed in the F strain fed the LCHL diet. The superior feed utilization and the higher protein retention efficiency of the F strain fed a high-lipid diet suggested that the F strain utilized lipids better than the A strain.
