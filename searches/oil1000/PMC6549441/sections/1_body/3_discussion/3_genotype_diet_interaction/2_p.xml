<p class="p">In conclusion, dietary carbohydrate and lipid concentration interacted with genotype to some extent. For example, although a high-carbohydrate diet stimulated glycolysis and lipogenesis in both gibel carp strains, the F strain more efficiently utilized dietary lipids than the A strain. This was indicated by the higher levels of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, increased fatty acid oxidation potential in the muscle, and improved nutrient retention in the F strain carp fed a high-lipid diet. Glucose uptake and glycolysis potential were also greater in the F strain as compared to the A strain. Thus, genetic selection might help to breed new gibel carp strains with improved carbohydrate and lipid utilization abilities.</p>
