<p class="p">Crude lipid content did not vary among diets in either strain of gibel carp. Lipid accumulation is a complex process involving lipid transport, uptake, synthesis, and catabolism (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>). In vertebrates like fish, lipoproteins are the primary carriers of lipids through the circulatory system of vertebrates (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>). Lipoproteins deliver endogenous and dietary lipids to peripheral tissues, where LPL hydrolyzes the TGs of TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>). Fatty acids are then released and taken up by the tissues for oxidation or storage (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). Although the mRNA expression of 
 <italic class="italic">lpl</italic> did not vary in the liver or muscle of either strain, the elevated hepatic LPL activity observed in gibel carp fed with the HCLL and MCML diets implied an increase in liver tissue fatty acid uptake in these fish. In addition, lipogenesis potential was increased in the fish fed the HCLL diet, as indicated by the increased abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">srebp1-c</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">acly</italic> transcripts in the liver and the increased abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">srebp1-c</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">acc</italic> in the muscle. Concurrent with this, higher ACC and FAS levels were observed in HCLL and MCML, confirmed that enhanced lipogenesis in these two groups. Such increases might lead to the accumulation of crude lipids and triglycerides in the livers of these fish. Moreover, the HCLL and MCML diets also promoted lipolysis (i.e., increased 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> transcription) in the muscle and fatty acid oxidation (i.e., increased 
 <italic class="italic">aco3</italic> transcription) in the liver. Thus, increased lipolysis, lipid uptake (i.e., LPL activity) and the induction of the lipogenesis pathway, was observed in both strains fed the HCLL and MCML diets. This result partially explained the similarity in body lipid content across the two strains of gibel carp and across the different dietary carbohydrate and lipid.
