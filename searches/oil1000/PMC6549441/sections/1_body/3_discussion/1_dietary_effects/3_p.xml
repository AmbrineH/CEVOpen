 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>). Unlike the liver, glucose transport and glycolysis in the fish muscle were unaffected by the dietary concentrations of carbohydrate and lipid. This indicated that the liver might be the first organ to respond to variations in the dietary carbohydrate and lipid in gibel carp. Unlike in rainbow trout, both mRNA and activity levels of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis were unaltered in both A strain and F strain fed a high carbohydrate diet (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Plasma glucose levels were unaffected by ingestion of a high carbohydrate diet, suggesting that both gibel carp strains were able to efficiently regulate glycemia. Overall, the stable plasma glucose levels might be due to the increased lipogenesis potential of the liver and the muscle, as well as the lack of alteration in gluconeogenesis.
