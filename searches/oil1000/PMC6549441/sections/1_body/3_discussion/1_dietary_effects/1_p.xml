 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). Excess carbohydrates are converted into simple sugars by digestion, then into pyruvate by glycolysis; pyruvate is then either oxidized for energy or channeled into pathways for fatty acids synthesis (lipogenesis) when energy is available (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). It was therefore unsurprising that the highest levels of hepatic crude lipids and triglycerides were observed in the HCLL-fed fish across both strains. This result may also explain the higher HSIs identified in these groups. The higher LRE levels observed in the HCLL- and MCML-fed groups suggested that carbohydrates might have been converted into lipids and then accumulated in both strains of gibel carp. The lower LRE levels observed in fish fed the LCHL diet might be because more dietary lipids were used for energy in these fish, decreasing lipid retention efficiency. Thus, the dietary carbohydrate and lipid concentrations played a vital role in nutrient retention, despite the interactions identified between diet and genotype.
