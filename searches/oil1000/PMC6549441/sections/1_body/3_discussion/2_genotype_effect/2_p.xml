<p class="p">We found that the growth performance of A strain was better than that of F strain, irrespective of diet. The higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) FR observed in A strain as compared to F strain might be the major factor responsible for the superior growth performance of this strain. However, the glucose uptake of F strain was better than that of A strain, as indicated by the higher expression levels of 
 <italic class="italic">glut2</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.003) in the liver and 
 <italic class="italic">glut4</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the muscle. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of 
 <italic class="italic">gk</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.023) and 
 <italic class="italic">6pfk</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the liver, and 
 <italic class="italic">6pfk</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.002) and 
 <italic class="italic">pk</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.002) in the muscle of F strain were higher than in A strain, indicating that F strain had a greater glycolysis potential than A strain.
