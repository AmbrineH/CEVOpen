<p class="p">Here, we found that genetic background affected lipid metabolism. Plasma triglyceride content was higher in the F strain than in the A strain, irrespective of diet, despite the interactions (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.013) identified between genotype and diet. Indeed, NEFA (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and LDL-C (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.016) levels were higher in the F strain as compared to the A strain. With respect to lipogenesis, 
 <italic class="italic">acly</italic> was upregulated (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.031) in the muscle of the F strain as compared to the A strain, irrespective of diet. As compared to the A strain, the F strain had higher (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.016) levels of plasma LDL-C; increased 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ppar</italic>α transcription in the muscle; and increased 
 <italic class="italic">aco3</italic> transcription in both liver and muscle. This implied that, in the F strain, transportation of hepatic lipids to peripheral tissues was better, providing energy via the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway after hydrolyzation. As compared to the F strain, the A strain had a higher 
 <italic class="italic">atgl</italic> expression in the liver and lower 
 <italic class="italic">hsl</italic> expression in the muscle, suggesting that the triglyceride hydrolyzation limits in the liver and muscle were not the same between strains. However, LPL activity was higher in the A strain than in the F strain, suggesting better hydrolization ability of triacylglycerols in chylomicrons and VLDL in this strain (
