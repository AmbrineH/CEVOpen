<p class="p">Gibel carp (
 <italic class="italic">Carassius gibelio</italic>), an omnivorous freshwater fish, is widely cultivated in China due to its high economic value (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). Gibel carp reproduce both sexually and asexually (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). Gibel carp eggs are activated by heterospecific sperm (gynogenesis), producing all-female strains of offspring (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>). The CAS III (A) strain, which grows rapidly, is the most commonly cultured gibel carp strain in China, accounting for ~70% of all gibel carp produced (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). Strain CAS V (F), a relatively new strain, has higher disease resistance and faster growth than the A strain (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). Previous studies have shown that insulin treatment differently affected the glucose and lipid metabolisms in two strains (A strain and DT strain) of gibel carp (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). And the DT cleared excess blood glucose more quickly than did the A strain in a glucose tolerance test (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>). In addition, gibel carp displayed different priorities and sensibilities in the mobilization of energy reserves (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Thus, we put forward the hypothesis that the effects of dietary carbohydrate and lipid concentrations on growth performance, feed utilization, glucose, and lipid metabolism could be different between A strain and F strain. Therefore, in this study, A strain and F strain were fed one of three different isonitrogenous diets: HCLL (High Carbohydrate Low Lipid, 45% carbohydrate, 2% lipid), MCML (Medium Carbohydrate Medium Lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 8% lipid), or LCHL (Low Carbohydrate High Lipid, 15% carbohydrate, 14% lipid). Growth performance, feed utilization, gene expression and enzyme activity involved in glucose and lipid metabolism were compared between these two strains among the three diets. Then, any genotype Ã— diet interactions were assessed.
