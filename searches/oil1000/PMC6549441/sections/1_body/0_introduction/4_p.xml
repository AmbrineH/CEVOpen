<p class="p">The efficiency of carbohydrate and lipid utilization differs among fish species and genotypes, as does the regulation of the glucose and lipid metabolisms. Previous studies have shown that carbohydrate utilization varies in different strains of salmonids (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). For example, lipids were metabolized differently in two lines of rainbow trout (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, Walbaum 1792) divergently selected for muscle fat content: one line (“F”) more effectively stored excess glucose and more efficiently bioconverted fatty acids in the intestine than did the other line (“L”) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). Different lipid sources also induced genotype-specific effects in two lines of Atlantic salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>): the transcriptional expression levels of genes associated with the lipid metabolism (
 <italic class="italic">ppar</italic>α, 
 <italic class="italic">ppar</italic>β, and 
 <italic class="italic">srebp-1</italic>) decreased in the “lean” strain fed vegetable oil (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). Thus, the molecular metabolic response to variations in the dietary carbohydrate and lipid levels might differ among fish strains.
