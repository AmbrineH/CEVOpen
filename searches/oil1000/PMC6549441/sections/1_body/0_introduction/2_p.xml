<p class="p">Carbohydrate is the least expensive and most readily-available source of dietary energy for aquatic feeds (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). Feeds with proper levels of carbohydrate are more efficiently pelletized, reduce the catabolism of proteins and lipids for energy, and provide metabolites for biological syntheses (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). However, fish feeds with an overabundance of dietary carbohydrate may lead to unwanted fat depositions, suppressed immune function, and reduced health (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>). Dietary lipids are important for fish growth and development as they provide energy, supply essential fatty acids, and act as vectors for fat-soluble vitamins (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). However, suboptimal and/or excess levels of dietary lipids may have adverse effects on fish growth and immunity (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). Importantly, dietary lipid and carbohydrate could affect utilization of each other in fish as lipid could be converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis and glucose could be deposited as lipids in tissues (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). Therefore, determination of the optimal relative levels of carbohydrates and lipids in fish feeds is of great significance to aquaculture.
