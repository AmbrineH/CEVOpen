 <p> Gene expression levels of selected enzymes and transcription factors associated with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generation and lipogenesis in the liver (A) and muscle (B) of the A strain (black bars) and the F strain (gray bars) fed the HCLL (High Carbohydrate Low Lipid, 45% carbohydrate, 2% lipid), MCML (Medium Carbohydrate Medium Lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 8% lipid), or LCHL (Low Carbohydrate High Lipid, 15% carbohydrate, 14% lipid) diet. Measurements were taken 8 h after the last feeding. Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1- c ( srebp1-c), ATP citrate lyase ( acly), acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( acc), and fatty acid synthase ( fas) mRNA levels were measured using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Results represent the mean Â± s.e.m ( n = 6). Significance was determined using a two-way ANOVA ( P &lt; 0.05), followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. </p>
