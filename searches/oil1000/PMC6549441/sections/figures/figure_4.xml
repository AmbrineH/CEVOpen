  <p class="p">Gene expression of selected enzymes associated with lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in the liver 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> and muscle 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> of A strain (black bars) and F strain (gray bars) fed the HCLL (High Carbohydrate Low Lipid, 45% carbohydrate, 2% lipid), MCML (Medium Carbohydrate Medium Lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 8% lipid), or LCHL (Low Carbohydrate High Lipid, 15% carbohydrate, 14% lipid) diet. Measurements were taken 8 h after the last feeding. Lipolysis, including the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (
   <italic class="italic">atgl</italic>), hormone-sensitive lipase (
   <italic class="italic">hsl</italic>), and lipoprotein lipase (
   <italic class="italic">lpl</italic>) were measured using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. And fatty acid oxidation, as indicated by the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (
   <italic class="italic">ppar</italic>α), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (
   <italic class="italic">cpt1a</italic>), and acyl-CoA oxidase 3 (
   <italic class="italic">aco3</italic>) were also measured using the same methods. Results represent the mean ± s.e.m (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6). Significance was determined using a two-way ANOVA (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test.
