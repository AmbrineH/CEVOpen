 <p> Gene expression of selected enzymes associated with lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in the liver (A) and muscle (B) of A strain (black bars) and F strain (gray bars) fed the HCLL (High Carbohydrate Low Lipid, 45% carbohydrate, 2% lipid), MCML (Medium Carbohydrate Medium Lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 8% lipid), or LCHL (Low Carbohydrate High Lipid, 15% carbohydrate, 14% lipid) diet. Measurements were taken 8 h after the last feeding. Lipolysis, including the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase ( atgl), hormone-sensitive lipase ( hsl), and lipoprotein lipase ( lpl) were measured using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. And fatty acid oxidation, as indicated by the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ( pparα), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A ( cpt1a), and acyl-CoA oxidase 3 ( aco3) were also measured using the same methods. Results represent the mean ± s.e.m ( n = 6). Significance was determined using a two-way ANOVA ( P &lt; 0.05), followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. </p>
