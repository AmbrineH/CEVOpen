<p class="p">Our findings add relevant information to the pharmacological activity of these species concomitantly providing new insights to their mechanism of action and reinforcing the use of thyme plants as topical antiseptics and disinfectants, since toxicity towards keratinocytes was absent at most of the bioactive concentrations. In addition to the relevant antifungal activity, both thymes have a very good essential oil yield, which increases their commercial interest and industrial potential. Overall, our results raise awareness on species poorly recognized and valued, thus paving the way for a better industrial exploitation of these plants namely in the pharmaceutical field.</p>
