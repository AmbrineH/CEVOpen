<p class="p">This study highlights the antifungal potential of two Iberian endemic thyme species: 
 <italic class="italic">T. camphoratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic>. Of relevance, the results demonstrated that both oils were able to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and several dermatophyte strains. Moreover, the oils were very effective in inhibiting 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> germ tube formation at concentrations well below the MIC and in a much higher extend than fluconazole, an antifungal drug widely used in the clinic. Finally, 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic> oil was more effective in decreasing yeast mitochondrial activity and disrupting preformed biofilms in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic>. Overall, our results point out promising anti-virulent effects for these oils, foreseeing a potential application in the management of disseminative candidiasis.
