 <italic class="italic">Thymus carnosu</italic>s essential oil was slightly more toxic (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.705 mg/mL) than 
 <italic class="italic">T. camphoratus</italic> oil (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.848 mg/mL). Nevertheless, at bioactive concentrations, against the majority of the dermatophyte strains, as well as at concentrations that inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> germ tube formation, no toxicity was observed, thus pointing out a safety profile for a further development of topical formulations (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Additionally, at lower concentrations (below 0.28 mg/mL) both essential oils increased cell viability (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). This could be due to an increase in keratinocytes proliferation or due to the stimulation of their mitochondrial activity and therefore, additional studies should be conducted to further understand this event.
