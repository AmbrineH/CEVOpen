<p class="p">The effect of the isolated major compounds, namely borneol, camphene, 1,8-cineole and α-pinene was also considered to assess which of these compounds could contribute to the activity of the oils. Our results show that both essential oils have a stronger effect on the inhibition of the germ tube formation in comparison to the isolated major compounds. Remarkably, although α-pinene showed lower MIC and MFC values than the essential oil (
