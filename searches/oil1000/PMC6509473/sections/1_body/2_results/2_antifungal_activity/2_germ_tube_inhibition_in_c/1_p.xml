<p class="p">Since the yeast-to-hypha transition is an important virulence factor associated with the pathogenesis of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> infections, the effect of the oils on the germ tube formation in 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 was assessed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, both essential oils inhibited the germ tube formation at concentrations well below their respective MIC, with 
 <italic class="italic">T. camphoratus</italic> being more effective and attaining ca. 40% inhibition at 0.07 mg/mL (MIC/16). Fluconazole (MIC = 0.001 mg/mL), the antifungal drug of choice in the clinic for the management of candidiasis, failed to inhibit this feature even at concentrations much higher than its MIC. Indeed, even at 0.2 mg/mL, that corresponds to fluconazole’s MIC×200 (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), the antifungal drug was completely ineffective.
