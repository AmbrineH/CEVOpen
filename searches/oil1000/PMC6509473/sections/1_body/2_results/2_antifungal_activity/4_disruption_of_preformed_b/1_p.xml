<p class="p">Bearing in mind that 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> biofilms are also important virulence factors, the capacity of the essential oils to decrease both biofilm mass (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>) and biofilm viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>) were also assessed. Overall, both oils were effective at concentrations close to their respective MIC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>), with 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic> essential oil being slightly more active in reducing biofilm viability since it decreased this feature at MIC/2 (0.57 mg/mL; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, fluconazole was ineffective in decreasing biofilm biomass showing a slight effect in biofilm viability reduction at concentrations much higher than its MIC (MICÃ—128; data not shown).
