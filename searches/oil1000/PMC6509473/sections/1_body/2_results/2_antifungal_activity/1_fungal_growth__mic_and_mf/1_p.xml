<p class="p">The antifungal activity (MICs and MFCs) of both essential oils and their main isolated compounds is presented in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Overall, both oils were more effective against 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> with MIC values of 0.14 mg/mL and showed poor antifungal activity against the tested 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> strains. For 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp., the essential oils of both species showed a slight fungicidal effect for most of the strains. For dermatophytes, both oils showed a fungicidal effect, but 
 <italic class="italic">T. camphoratus</italic> was more effective than 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic>, presenting lower MIC values for most of the tested strains (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>).
