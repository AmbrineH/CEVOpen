<p class="p">Regarding the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds, α-pinene was, by far, the most effective compound (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, α-pinene showed a fungicidal effect for most of the tested strains, being very effective against 
 <italic class="italic">C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. rubrum</italic> (MIC = 0.07 mg/mL). Contrarily, 1,8-cineole and camphene were ineffective against many of the tested strains, while borneol showed a slight antifungal effect (MIC ranging from 1.11 to 4.5 mg/mL;
