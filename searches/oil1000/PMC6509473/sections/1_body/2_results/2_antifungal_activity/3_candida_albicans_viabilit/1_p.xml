<p class="p">The effect of the essential oils on 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> viability was also assessed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Once again, our results show that both oils inhibited 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> mitochondrial activity at concentrations lower than their respective MIC. Nevertheless, 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic> essential oil showed better results since it significantly reduced 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> mitochondrial activity at concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 0.57 mg/mL. Indeed, a viability decrease of more than 70% was observed at 0.28 mg/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic> essential oil whereas 
 <italic class="italic">T. camphoratus</italic> oil decreased cell viability of the yeast only 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 44% at 0.57 mg/mL and at lower concentrations (â‰¤0.28 mg/mL) was ineffective (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). A trypan blue exclusion assay, that assesses the integrity of the cell wall, showed 100% of living fungi cells in all the tested concentrations (data not shown), thus confirming the adverse effect on the essential oils directly on mitochondrial activity.
