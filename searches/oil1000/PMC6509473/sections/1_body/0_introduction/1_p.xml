<p class="p">In the last years, the prevalence of fungal infections has increased significantly, especially in immunocompromised individuals, with concomitant life-threatening increments (

 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic>-associated BSI, while 
 <italic class="italic">A. fumigatus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> are responsible for the majority of 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic>-associated BSI (

Regarding superficial mycoses, the major causal agents are dermatophytes that remain a health concern worldwide, in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. This is mainly attributable to the resistance of fungi to conventional antifungal therapies as well as to high relapse rates (
