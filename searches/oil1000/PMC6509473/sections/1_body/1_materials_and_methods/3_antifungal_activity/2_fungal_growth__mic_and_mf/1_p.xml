 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLSI, 2008b</xref>) and M38-A2 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLSI, 2008a</xref>) for yeasts and filamentous fungi, respectively, were used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the essential oils and their major compounds (borneol, camphene, 1,8-cineole, Î±-pinene), as described previously (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zuzarte et al., 2013</xref>). MICs were recorded as the lowest concentration of the essential oil/compound that inhibited fungal growth and MFCs were determined as the lowest concentration of the essential oil/compound able to kill the fungal strain. Two reference antifungal compounds, amphotericin B (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and fluconazole (Pfizer, New York, United States), were used to control the sensitivity of the tested microorganisms. The experiments were performed at least in triplicates and a range of values presented whenever the results were not in agreement between replicates.
