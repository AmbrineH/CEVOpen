 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>) with slight modifications. Briefly, cell suspensions were prepared in RPMI and adjusted to a final density of 0.5–2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> CFU/Ml. The suspensions were then distributed into 12-well plates (1 mL/well) and incubated, without agitation, at 37°C. After 18–24 h of incubation, the cells were carefully homogenized, collected and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Essential oils (0.07–0.57 mg/mL) were added to the pellets in a final volume of 1 mL and then the solutions were transferred to the microwell plate. Following an incubation at 37°C for 1 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and 500 μL of 0.5 mg/mL of MTT (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) in RPMI was added. After an incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the water-insoluble blue formazan crystals (viable cells) were solubilized with 300 μL of DMSO and measured spectrophotometrically at 510 nm using an ELISA microplate reader (SLT, Austria). An additional trypan blue exclusion assay was also performed to confirm the number of living cells.
