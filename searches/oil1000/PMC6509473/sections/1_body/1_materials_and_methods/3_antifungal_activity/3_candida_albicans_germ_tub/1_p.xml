<p class="p">To determine the effect of the essential oils and their major compounds on the yeast-mycelium transition, cell suspensions of 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231, from overnight cultures on SDA, were prepared in NYP medium [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pinto et al. (2013)</xref>. Briefly, 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> suspension was adjusted to a density of 1.0 ± 0.2 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL and 990 μL of this suspension was distributed to test tubes. To each tube, 10 μL of sub-inhibitory concentrations of each essential oil and their major compounds were added and the cells were incubated without agitation for 3 h. Then, germ tube formation was registered under a light microscope (40×). Germ tubes were considered when the germinating protuberance was at least as long as the diameter of the blastopore. The conventional antifungal drug, fluconazole, was also tested and DMSO in a maximum concentration of 1% (v/v) was used as a control. The results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.
