<p class="p">The human keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT) was obtained from DKFZ (Heidelberg). Keratinocytes were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (high glucose) supplemented with 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin, 3.02 g/L sodium bicarbonate and 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal bovine serum, at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Evaluation of cell viability was performed by the colorimetric MTT assay, as previously reported. Quantification of formazan crystals was performed using an ELISA microplate reader at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 620 nm. The results were expressed as the percentage of MTT reduction relatively to control cells.
