<p class="p">Studies on the antifungal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. camphoratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic> essential oils are scarce and based upon different methodologies. Indeed, previous studies using the disk diffusion method, showed a weak or even no inhibitory effect of both oils on 
 <italic class="italic">C. albicans</italic> (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dandlen et al., 2011</xref>). Regarding the antifungal potential of other thyme species with high amounts of 1,8-cineole, some studies have been reported. For example, the essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">T. mastichina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. capitellatus</italic> (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salgueiro et al., 2006</xref>) showed a weaker antifungal effect against several yeasts, dermatophytes and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus</italic> strains compared with the oils tested in the present study. In opposition, the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">T. herba-barona</italic> (

 <italic class="italic">, T. zygis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pina-Vaz et al., 2004</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">T. zygis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">zygis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gonçalves et al., 2010</xref>), and 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pina-Vaz et al., 2004</xref>) showed a more preeminent activity due to their high content in phenolic terpenoids, namely thymol and/or carvacrol. In the present study, the antifungal effect of the essential oils could be mainly attributed to α-pinene since it was found in considerable amounts in both oils. Nevertheless, active minor compounds may also contribute to the activity of the essential oil. For example, linalool, cadinol, and terpinen-4-ol, all minor compounds of both 
 <italic class="italic">T. carnosus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. camphoratus</italic> essential oils, have also been widely described as antifungal agents (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Su and Ho, 2016</xref>) and an anti-yeast addictive effect has been reported for α-pinene and limonene (
