 <p> Candida albicans ATCC 10231 biofilm biomass (A) and biofilm viability (B). Cells were treated with different concentrations of Thymus camphoratus and Thymus carnosus essential oil. Biofilm mass was quantified by the crystal violet assay and biofilm viability assessed using the XTT assay. One-way ANOVA was performed separately for each species and values are expressed as a percentage of biofilm biomass or viability relative to control (mean ± SEM of three independent assays). ∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.0001, compared to control. “+” indicates MIC values of the essential oils. </p>
