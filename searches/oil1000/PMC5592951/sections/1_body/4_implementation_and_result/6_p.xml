<p class="p">Therefore, the optimization process, which is considered as the last and substantial phase in EOROT tool, begins its work. The target of the optimization is to determine the optimal solution to inhibit the growth of the existing bacteria. Thus, deciding the optimal solution is related to two issues: EOROT will search for the EO that achieves the bacterial activityâ€™s inhibition with the less MIC rate, and at the same time, it will try to maximize the utilization of the selected EO in inhibiting multiple types of the existing bacteria as displayed in
