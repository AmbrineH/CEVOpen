<p class="p">After reducing the EOsâ€™ compounds, the EOROT continues its job by filtering the 24 EOs to find the ones that have a high antibacterial activity. The logic rules that are defined in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd4-aabc-10-065" class="xref">Equation 4</xref> will be applied to calculate the accuracy rate 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> for every EO, which is considered as the measurement parameter in determining the antibacterial activity degree for the EO. Accuracy rate 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> is predefined in our algorithm with the value 0.6; thus, the EOs that have an accuracy rate &lt;0.6 will be neglected as they do not contain effective antibacterial compounds. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-aabc-10-065" class="xref">Table 5</xref> presents the final results of the EOROT reduction process. As it is displayed, the number of EOs is reduced to 19 and thus achieves a high accuracy rate in antibacterial activity.
