<p class="p">Although the EOs are characterized by their efficiency as antibacterial organisms, their effective degree is varied according to their chemical composition, which may vary due to their agriculture, geographic location, seasonal variability, and climatic factors and according to the part of the plant (fruit, leaves, etc.).
 <xref rid="b4-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref> Nowadays, the determination of the bioactivity of the EOs from their chemical composition is a well-established idea among the scientific community. However, practically, the traditional experimental methods usually have many limitations. Characterizing the complexity of the chemical interactions among the components of EOs is a significant limitation. In addition, defining the relations between these components and the attacked microbes is another limitation.
 <xref rid="b3-aabc-10-065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> Thus, the importance of using the computational models instead has increased. Developing a computational tool to select the EOs that have antimicrobial activities depending on knowing their effective compounds only and without complex laboratory analysis can save money and time and enhance consistency of final products. Generally, the computational tools (e.g., artificial neural networks [ANNs], genetic algorithm [GA], and particle swarm optimization [PSO]), especially those that are based on mathematical or statistical models (e.g., rough sets [RS] and fuzzy logic), can enhance the ability of determining the relationships among the EOsâ€™ compounds such as the chemical interactions, synergisms, and antagonisms. Accordingly, these tools may be very useful in classifying, optimizing, and predicting the antibacterial activity of a certain EO depending on the historical analysis of other EOs.
