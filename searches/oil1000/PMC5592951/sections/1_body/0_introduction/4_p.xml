<p class="p">One of the main challenges faced by scientific researchers in determining the antimicrobial activity of the EOs is the huge number of compounds that constitute the oil and which compounds have the significant antimicrobial effects. In this article, a new computational tool is presented based on RS and PSO algorithms. The proposed tool uses the RS algorithm as a reduction mathematical model to solve the problem of the huge number of EO compounds, which accordingly improves the optimization process that is based on PSO to determine the most proper EO for every type of bacteria.</p>
