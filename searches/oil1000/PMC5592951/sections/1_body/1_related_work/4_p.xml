<p class="p">Another direction of using the artificial computing is the optimization process. Rajkovic et al have developed two optimization models to predict the antifungal effects for mixing the EOs of “
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.” and “
 <italic class="italic">Cinnamomum cassia</italic> L.”. The two proposed models are the response surface methodology (RSM) and the ANN combined with the GA. Both of the two models have tended to optimize the variables of the mixture process (i.e., time of action, concentration of individual or mixture EOs, and their mass ratio). Based on the mean relative percent deviation (MRPD), both of the two models have provided a good quality of prediction for the antifungal effect in terms of the three predefined independent variables. Nevertheless, due to the low value of the MRPD for the ANN – GA model, it has achieved more accuracy in predicting the antifungal effect of the EO mixture than the RSM model (±10.7% for RSM and ±0.1% ANN – GA).
