<p class="p">According to Sartoratto et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>], the EO from 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> showed inhibition values between 0.05 and &gt;2 mg/mL against Gram-positive bacteria but it was not active against Gram-negative bacteria. However, Duarte et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>] reported that 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> inhibited 12 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> serotypes, with MIC values between 400–1000 μg/mL, showing moderate activity. 
 <italic class="italic">A. polystachya</italic> showed inhibition values between 3.64 and 29.13 μg/mL against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but it was not active against 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">A. gratissima</italic> showed inhibition values between 1000 and 4000 μg/mL against Gram-positive and 2000–4000 μg/mL against Gram-negative bacteria. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was twice the MIC in most of the cases and was the same as the MIC only for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Aloysia sellowii</italic> showed inhibition values between 1.7 and 16 mg/mL against Gram-positive bacteria and between 6.7 and &gt;20 mg/mL for Gram-negative bacteria. The MBC values were between two and three times the MIC. 
 <italic class="italic">Aloysia sellowii</italic> was active against yeasts with MIC values between 4–16 mg/mL and Minimal Letal Concentration between 4–&gt;20 mg/mL [
