 <xref rid="molecules-23-00544-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> were studied by means of the disk diffusion assay. Disks of 6 mm of diameter were impregnated with 10 or 15 Î¼L of EO, resulting in inhibition halos between 8 and 20 mm diameter. Aguiar et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] considered that halos with a 10 mm diameter represent a good inhibition. According to the observed results in the literature, halos with diameters larger than 20 mm are rare. However, there are reports with these values for

The use of ATCC strains facilitates the comparison of the antibacterial potency between plants of the same species that grow in different regions. However, the use of clinical isolates gives a valuable contribution in this field, since it gives a more realistic scenario of the activity of EOs against pathogen strains.
