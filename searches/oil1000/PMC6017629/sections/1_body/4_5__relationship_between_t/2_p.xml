<p class="p">The mechanism of action of EOs depends on their chemical composition, and their antimicrobial activity is not attributable to a single mechanism; this is widely described by Nazzaro et al. in their work [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. The effect of the chemical constituents depends on their amount in the EOs, i.e., at low concentrations, they can interfere with enzymes involved in the production of energy and, at higher concentrations, they can denature proteins [
