<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity of EOs depends on their chemical composition and on the amount of the single components. Most EOs have a greater effect on Gram-positive bacteria than on Gram-negative bacteria. This behavior is attributed to the differences in the bacterial cell membrane composition. In Gram-positive bacteria, hydrophobic components easily penetrate the cell wall and act upon it as within the cytoplasm. Gram-negative bacteria have a peptidoglycan layer that is 2–3 nm thick, and an outer membrane (OM) lies outside the thin peptidoglycan layer and is firmly linked to it by Braun’s lipoprotein embedded in the OM. This is composed of a double layer of phospholipids that is linked to the inner membrane by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The peptidoglycan layer is covered by an OM that contains various proteins as well as LPS, which makes the bacteria more resistant to EOs and other natural extracts with antimicrobial activity [
