Because of the nature of their chemical structure, alcohols possess a strong binding affinity to different molecular structures, such as proteins or glycoproteins. Hence, they have great affinities for cell membranes and exhibit high potential to permeate cell walls, leading to the leakage of cytoplasmic material [
