<p class="p">The EO of 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> and its main components, such as citral and carvone, presented antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. The lowest MIC and MBC values were 0.5â€‰mg/mL when 
 <italic class="italic">L. alba</italic> EOs, citral, and carvone were used. The inhibition (100%) of 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation and the elimination of biofilm cells were confirmed. No elimination of biofilm cells was observed when carvone was used. Carvone is a monoterpene reported as one of the most effective antimicrobial agents present in several plants. Its main mechanism of action comprises the destabilization of the structure of phospholipids and the interaction with membrane proteins, and it acts as a proton exchanger reducing the pH gradient across the membrane [
