<p class="p">Thymol is one of the monoterpene phenols present in EOs from plants belonging to the Verbenaceae family (

 <xref rid="B119-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>] speculated that the antimicrobial effect of thymol might result, at least in part, from a perturbation of the lipid fraction of the bacterial plasma membrane, resulting in the leakage of intracellular materials. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>] confirmed it, because they demonstrated that this natural compound induces the permeabilization and depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane. In addition, Chauhan &amp; Kang [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>] evaluated the antimicrobial properties and mechanism of action of thymol against 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhimurium</italic> and showed the disruption of membrane integrity. They concluded that this is the main mechanism of action of thymol.
