<p class="p">The checkerboard test evaluates the effect of interactions between two antimicrobial substances. This assay is one of the most commonly used to determine synergism. The MIC values of combinations are registered at one time point [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>], and the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index for the two antimicrobial substances are calculated. Sometimes, the results of this assay are interpreted by plotting an isobologram. Another test used to determine synergism is the time-kill assay. It involves measuring the number of viable bacteria in a liquid medium in the presence of a particular combination of antimicrobial substances at different time points. Although time-kill curves are not widely used to study antibacterial interactions, they can be considered a clinically relevant model if the concentrations used represent those achieved at the site of an infection [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. As previously mentioned, for the determination of antibacterial activity, methods used to evaluate interactions between EOs and antibiotics differ widely, and this makes data comparison difficult. However, the use of FIC indexes allows comparisons of the results. The development of a more standardized method of serial passaging in sublethal concentrations of EO would enable a better investigation of the possible loss of sensitivity or cross-resistance [
