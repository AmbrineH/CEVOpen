<p class="p">The presence of 
 <italic class="italic">L. sidoides</italic> EO at 50%, 25%, 12% and 6%, produced an increase of 429.41%, 349%, 256.82% and 21.53% in gentamicin activity against a 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> strain. The activity of amikacin and neomycin was enhanced when either antibiotic were combined with this EO [

 <xref rid="B87-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] combined 
 <italic class="italic">L. sidoides</italic> EO with aminoglycosides (gentamicin and neomycin) and β-lactams (penicillin G and ceftriaxone) and demonstrated indifferent and synergistic effects depending on the bacteria tested. The combination of the EO with aminoglycosides was synergistic on 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> (the MIC was reduced four times)
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> Synergism was also detected when EO and gentamicin were used against 
 <italic class="italic">K. pneumoniae</italic> (the MIC decreased from 32 to 1 μg/mL). This mix showed no effects on the other bacteria. Regarding the interactions between this EO and β-lactams, synergism was detected against 
 <italic class="italic">S. mutans</italic> (EO and penicillin G) and 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecalis</italic> (EO and ceftriaxone), whereas no effect was found against other bacteria. In the first case, there was a four-fold reduction in the MIC value; the MIC value decreased sixteen times when the EO was combined with ceftriaxone. Antagonistic interactions have not been reported in any of the papers analyzed in this work.
