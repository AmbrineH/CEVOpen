<p class="p">Many examples of synergism can be found in the literature regarding 
 <italic class="italic">Lantana</italic> species. The concentration of neomycin decreased 50% against multiresistant 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> when this antimicrobial was combined with 
 <italic class="italic">L. caatingensis</italic> EO. Similarly, there was a 75% decrease in the concentration of amikacin against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 12692 when this EO was present [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-23-00544" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">L. camara</italic> EO at 50 μg/mL increased the activity of amikacin up to 65% against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> and up to 29% against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic>. When this EO was combined with gentamicin, the antibiotic efficacy increased to 21% against

 <italic class="italic">Lantana montevidensis</italic> EO at 50 μg/mL improved the activity of gentamicin by 12% against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 15442 and by 10% against 
 <italic class="italic">S. aureus</italic> ATCC 12692. In addition, when this EO was combined with amikacin, the antibiotic efficacy increased up to 102% against
