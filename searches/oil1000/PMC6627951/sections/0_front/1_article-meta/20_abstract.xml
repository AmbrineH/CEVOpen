 <p class="p">Blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and the house fly (Diptera: Muscidae) are filth flies of medical importance, and control of their population is needed. As insecticide applications have resulted in fly resistance, and the exploration of plant essential oils (EOs) has increased against filth flies, this study assessed the combination of EOs with pyrethoids to enhance toxic efficacy. The EOs of five effective plants were screened initially against the house fly (
  <italic class="italic">Musca domestica</italic> L.). Their chemical constituent was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The main components of 
  <italic class="italic">Boesenbergia rotunda</italic> (Zingiberaceae) rhizome, 
  <italic class="italic">Curcuma longa</italic> (Zingiberaceae) rhizome, 
  <italic class="italic">Citrus hystrix</italic> (Rutaceae) fruit peel, 
  <italic class="italic">Ocimum gratissimum</italic> (Lamiaceae) seed, and 
  <italic class="italic">Zanthoxylum limonella</italic> (Rutaceae) fruit were δ-3-caren (35.25%), β-turmerone (51.68%), β-pinene (26.56%), p-cumic aldehyde (58.21%), and dipentene (60.22%), respectively. The screening test revealed that the three most effective plant EOs were from 
  <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic>, which were selected for the combination with two pyrethroid insecticides (permethrin and deltamethrin), in order to enhance their synergistic efficacy against the blow flies,

  <italic class="italic">megacephala</italic> Fabricius, 
  <italic class="italic">Chrysomya</italic>
  <italic class="italic">rufifacies</italic> Macquart, and 
  <italic class="italic">Lucilia cuprina</italic> Wiedemann, and the house fly. Synergistic action was presented in almost all of the flies tested with permenthrin/deltamethrin/EOs mixtures. It was interesting that the combination of deltamethrin with three EOs showed a synergistic effect on all of the tested flies. However, an antagonistic effect was observed in 
  <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> treated with permethrin-
  <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic> treated with permethrin-
  <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic>. The LD
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> of insecticides decreased when combined with plant EOs. This alternative strategy will be helpful in developing a formula for effective fly control management.
