<p class="p">Five variable descending concentrations were prepared for each mixture. These tests were carried out to determine the synergistic/antagonistic action resulted from vary descending at 5 concentrations of insecticides (permethrin/deltamethrin) with EO at its LD

The control group was treated with acetone only. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. Fly mortality following treatment was checked after 24 h.
