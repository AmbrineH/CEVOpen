<p class="p">EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Hewlett-Packard GC-MS system (Model 7890). The analysis was equipped with a split-splitless injector and HP5 mass-selective detector (MSD) (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 µm film thickness), coupled with a mass spectrometer selective detector 5975. The column temperature was increased from 50 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min; inlet, 250 °C splitless; injection volume, 0.5 µL; helium as the carrier gas at 1.0 mL/min; injection in split mode (250:1); total run time, 24 min. The MSD 5975 Network (EI) worked with scan parameters, 30–550 amu.; MS Quadrupole, 150 °C and MS Source, 230 °C. This analysis was performed at the Science and Technology Service Center, Chiang Mai University (STSC-CMU).</p>
