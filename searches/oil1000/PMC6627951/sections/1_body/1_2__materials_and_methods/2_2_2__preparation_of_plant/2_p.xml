About 250–300 g of ground plant powder was placed in an extraction column connected to a distillation flask containing ~1600 mL of distilled water and 10–15 glass beads. The distilled water was boiled to 100 °C in an immersion heater to produce steam that passed through the plant materials. The distillated mixture of essential oil and water was collected and allowed to settle into 2 layers over 3–5 days with the EO on top of the water. The water was released slowly, so that only the EO remained. The EO was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na
