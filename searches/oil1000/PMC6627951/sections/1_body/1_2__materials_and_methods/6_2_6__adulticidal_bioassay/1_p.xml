<p class="p">Technical grade insecticides (permethin and deltamethrin) were used for synergistic study. Permethrin (98.1% analytical standard, Pestanal
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Seelze, Germany) was diluted in 10 mL of acetone to obtain the stock solution of 500 ppm; while deltamethrin (99.5% analytical standard, Dr. Ehrenstorfer
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>, Augsburg, Germany) was dissolved in 10 mL of acetone to prepare stock solution of 500 ppm. Thirty females (3–5 days old) of each fly species were treated with both insecticides. Two hundred µl of each substance was diluted in acetone to a stock solution of five concentrations. Acetone alone was used as a control. Bioassay was carried out as described in
