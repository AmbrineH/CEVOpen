<p class="p">Screening for adulticidal toxicity of the five EOs was conducted against adult 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic>. Each EO was diluted in acetone to obtain five concentrations; and acetone alone was used as a control. Each dose was given to 30 female flies (3–5 days old). The topical application method [
