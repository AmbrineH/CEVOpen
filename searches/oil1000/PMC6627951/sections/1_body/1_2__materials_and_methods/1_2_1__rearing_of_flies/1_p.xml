 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> were obtained from laboratory strains maintained for at least 10 years at the Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand. They were reared in cages (30 × 30 × 30 cm) providing water and granulated sugar as food. Then, pork liver was put into the cage as a protein source and oviposition site. After female laid their eggs, approximately 100–200 first instars were transferred to transparent plastic boxes (12 × 15 × 6 cm) and fed with pork liver until the third instar reached prepupa and had no more need for feeding. The lid of each box was replaced with a fine silkscreen cloth sealed with adhesive paper tape for ventilation and prevention of larvae crawling out. The boxes were kept at natural temperatures and relative humidity until adult emergence [
