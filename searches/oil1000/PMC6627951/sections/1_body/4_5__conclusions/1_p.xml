<p class="p">This study assessed the synergistic action of adulticidal toxicity of plant EOs combined with permethrin/deltamethrin against 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. rufifacies, L. cuprina,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic>. Although this study found the antagonistic effect in some cases, the most synergistic effect was found in the combination of Permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">L. cuprina</italic>, with the highest SF of 10.35 and Deltamethrin-
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> against 
 <italic class="italic">C. rufifacies</italic>, with the highest SF of 7.57. These EOs presented a promising role as synergists to improve the efficacy of permethrin and deltamethrin. The mode of binary mixture application (e.g., repeated exposure with different dosages) merits further investigation for facilitating fully-competent fly management.
