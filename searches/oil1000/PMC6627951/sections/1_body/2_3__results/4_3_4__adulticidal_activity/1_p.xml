 <xref rid="insects-10-00178-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref> shows the toxicity of permethrin-EO mixtures against all of the tested flies. Only permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> mixtures exhibited synergistic action in 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic> by decreasing the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of permethrin from 0.05 to 0.0469 µg/fly (SF = 1.07). Meanwhile, synergistic action was observed in all permethrin-EO combinations against 
 <italic class="italic">C. rufifacies</italic>, by reducing the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of permethrin from 0.061 to 0.0093 µg/fly (SF = 6.56; permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>), followed by 0.0163 µg/fly (SF = 3.68; permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic>), and 0.0348 µg/fly (SF = 1.72; permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic>). A similar trend was observed in 
 <italic class="italic">L. cuprina</italic>, by lowering the LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of permethrin from 0.059 to 0.0057 µg/fly (SF = 10.35; permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>), followed by 0.0063 µg/fly (SF = 9.37; permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic>), and 0.0108 µg/fly (SF = 5.46; permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic>). Permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> mixtures and permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> resulted in a synergistic effect against 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic>, by reducing the insecticide used from 0.023 to 0.0105 µg/fly (SF = 2.19; the former mixture) and 0.0151 µg/fly (SF = 1.52; the latter mixture). No mortality was observed in the control flies.
