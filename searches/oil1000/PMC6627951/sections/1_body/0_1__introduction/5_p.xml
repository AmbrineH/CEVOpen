<p class="p">The combination of two substances that performed synergism has been documented [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. It has been reported that plant EOs have been used in combination with insecticides. For example, the deltamethrin-
 <italic class="italic">Ocimum basilicum</italic> mixture revealed synergistic action against the agricultural pest, 
 <italic class="italic">Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, by reducing 80% LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of the deltamethrin used [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Fazolin et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] showed enhanced larvicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. frugiperda</italic> with treatment of combined 
 <italic class="italic">Piper aduncum</italic> oil and one of alphacypermethrin, fenpropathrin, gamma-cyhalothrin or beta-cypermethrin. The effective concentrations of these insecticides were reduced to 25â€“50% by the presence of the EO, when compared with administration of insecticides alone. The synergism of 
 <italic class="italic">Solanum xanthocarpum</italic> with fenthion was reported against the mosquito, 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, with a 1:1 ratio of LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> between EO and insecticide [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the synergistic effect of EOs with pyrethroid insecticides (permethrin and deltamethrin) against 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. rufifacies, L. cuprina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic>. The combinations are expected to provide a promising alternative strategy for reducing the use of insecticides, which might be more effective than individual insecticides and plant extracts.
