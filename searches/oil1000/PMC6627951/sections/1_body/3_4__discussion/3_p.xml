<p class="p">Management of fly populations using chemical control with insecticide could lead to developing insecticide resistance. Meanwhile, biological control with plant EOs could not yield the efficacy achieved by insecticides, but this approach is environmentally safe. The combination in this study of deltametrin with each EO (
 <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic>) and permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> mixtures showed a synergistic effect in all of the fly species, whereas an antagonistic effect was seen in 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> treated with permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic>, and in only 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic> with permethrin-
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> treatment. However, the synergistic action of binary mixtures of two insecticides is rarely known [
 <xref rid="B41-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The possible reason for the synergistic efficacy could be the susceptibility of insect, development of resistance, and the different chemical compositions [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. It is probable that the observed synergism was the result of laboratory flies overwhelmed by the mixture of insecticide combined with EOs that disrupt different target sites. Pyrethroid type I (permethrin) causes presynaptic neuron repetitive discharge in insects, and pyrethroid type II (deltamethrin) causes a tonic release of transmitters which is indicative to membrane depolarization [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], whereas EO causes deterring oviposition, inhibiting growth, repelling, and mimicking juvenile hormones [
