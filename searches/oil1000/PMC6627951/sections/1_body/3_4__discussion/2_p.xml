<p class="p">Plants display the phenomenon of allelopathy, whereby they produce or release bioactive compounds that inhibit other organisms. More than 100,000 allelochemical groups are known, e.g., alkaloids, amines, amino acids, cyanogenic compounds, glucosides, glucosinolates, non-proteins, organic acids, peptides phenolics, polyacetylenes, quinones, and terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Each EO selected herein had a distinct principle component, being δ-3-caren for 
 <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic>, β-turmerone for 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic> and p-cumic aldehyde for 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum.</italic> Monoterpene was the compound of these oils and classified as a terpene type [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Rice and Coats [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] reported insecticidal activity of several monoterpenoids against 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic>, the red flour beetle (
 <italic class="italic">Tribolium castaneum</italic>), and the Southern corn rootworm (
 <italic class="italic">Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi</italic>). Molecules of these terpenes can penetrate into the cuticle of insects and interact with the target site; however, some of their portions may be metabolized and neutralized by insect defense mechanisms. Eventually, the amount of terpene molecules (toxicants) reaching the target site determines the toxicity of the substance [

 <xref rid="B38-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] investigated the insecticidal activity of 34 EOs from a range of plants and found that the most effective, with their main components, were 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha pulegium</italic> (pugelone 83.3%), 
 <italic class="italic">Origanum compactum</italic> (carvacrol 58.3% and thymol 12.6%), and 
 <italic class="italic">Pogostemon cablin</italic> (sesquiterpenes 95.3%), which expressed toxicity against 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic>. The LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> of 
 <italic class="italic">C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. rotunda</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">O. gratissimum</italic> EO was lower in this study than permethin/deltamethrin administered alone. This was not surprising, because EOs are composed of both active and inactive compounds, while synthetic insecticides are a single purified active compound [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Furthermore, the efficacy of EOs depends on the geographical origin of plants and environmental conditions, which significantly influences the biological properties of EOs [
 <xref rid="B40-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Regarding the adulticidal activity of insecticides, deltamethrin exhibited higher toxicity than permethrin, which is represented by lower LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values in 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. rufifacies</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. cuprina</italic>. This result was in contrast to investigations in Chiang Mai during 2015, when permethrin (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.0028 μg/fly) indicated more susceptibility than deltamethrin (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.0461 μg/fly) in 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The result of the analysis for 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> in this study indicated that permethrin exhibited more toxicity than deltamethrin. This agreed with a previous study that showed 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> exhibiting more susceptibility to permethrin (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.0049 μg/fly) than deltamethrin (LD
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 0.1058 μg/fly) [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-10-00178" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Based on permethrin 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic>, both 
 <italic class="italic">C. megacephala</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. domestica</italic> displayed a slight increase in insecticide resistance from 2015, showing ~18-fold and ~5-fold increased resistance, respectively [
