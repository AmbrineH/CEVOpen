<p class="p">Citral EO has been incorporated into edible films through emulsification. Film structural, physical, mechanical and barrier properties were evaluated. The combination of citral EO with SA and/or Pe gives continuous and transparent edible films. Samples with citral EO addition showed improved performances with respect to the neat ones. As compared to neat films, no substantial differences were observed in the visual appearance of the composite samples, with the exception of a slight yellowish hue. On the other hand, citral EO addition caused a different microstructure arrangement and some agglomerates. However, the film structure was not weakened as testified by the gas barrier and mechanical tests, rather a reinforcement role was exerted. Furthermore, by increasing the amount of citral EO, a slight increase of the thermal stability as well as of the surface hydrophobicity was recorded.</p>
