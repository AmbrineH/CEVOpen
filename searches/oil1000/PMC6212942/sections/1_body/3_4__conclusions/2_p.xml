<p class="p">With the aim to extend the shelf-life of food, the addition of essential oils can provide edible films with antimicrobial properties, depending both on their nature and interaction with the polymer matrix. Further studies are necessary to optimize and verify the suitability of these natural films on food products. The oil type and its interaction with the matrix determine the effectiveness of the edible films as food packaging material. In order to understand the feasibility of edible films to improve the shelf-life of food products susceptible to oxidation or to microbial spoilage, a real food systems needs to be investigated, together with specific tests on antioxidant activity [
