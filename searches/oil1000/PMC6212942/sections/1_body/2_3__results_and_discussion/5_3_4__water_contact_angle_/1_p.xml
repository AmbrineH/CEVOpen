<p class="p">Surface hydrophobicity is an important parameter to control the sensitivity of the films to water or moisture and it is usually evaluated by measuring the contact angle that forms between the film surface and a water droplet [

 <xref rid="B32-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Generally, higher contact angle values correspond to higher surface hydrophobicity, with higher surface water repellent ability.

 <xref rid="materials-11-01980-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>) demonstrated the high wettability of the prepared films, due to the presence of a high amount of ether bonds and free hydroxyl-groups. In fact, WCAs were in all cases below 50Â°. The addition of citral EO caused a rise of the contact angle. In particular, the higher the content of citral EO, the higher the WCA, because of the hydrophobic nature of this latter Therefore, the presence of citral EO plays a beneficial role in decreasing the wettability of the edible film, thus improving its protective action towards the wrapped food.
