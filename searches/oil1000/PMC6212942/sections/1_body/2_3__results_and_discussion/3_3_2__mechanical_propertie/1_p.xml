<p class="p">The tensile behavior of the films under study is reported in 
 <xref rid="materials-11-01980-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Films were analyzed in terms of their elastic modulus (E), stress at yield (σ
 <sub class="sub">y</sub>) and at break (σ
 <sub class="sub">b</sub>), and elongation at yield (ε
 <sub class="sub">y</sub>) and at break (ε
 <sub class="sub">b</sub>). Generally speaking, the tensile properties of edible films and coatings are dependent on film constituents, relative proportion and preparation conditions [
