<p class="p">The effect of the essential oil addition on the mechanical properties of edible films is quite complex and conflicting results have been reported in the literature, since both enhancement and weakening of the tensile characteristics have been observed [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Specific interactions between the film constituents and the oil, such as crosslinks, different structural arrangements of the components or the formation of heterogeneous biphasic structures, must be taken into consideration [
