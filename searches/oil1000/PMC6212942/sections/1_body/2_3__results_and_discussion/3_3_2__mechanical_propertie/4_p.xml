<p class="p">Our study demonstrates that citral EO does not have any detrimental effect on the tensile properties of SA and Pe based formulations. On the contrary, an enhancement of the tensile strength and of the film rigidity has been obtained. The results indicate that not only the film microstructure was preserved, yet citral EO played a reinforcement role. Also, the introduction of a hydrophobic compound may have caused a reduction of the film water absorption, this latter acting as plasticizer and causing a decrease of E and Ïƒ
