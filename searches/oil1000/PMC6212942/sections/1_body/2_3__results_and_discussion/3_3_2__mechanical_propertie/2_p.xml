<p class="p">Neat SA and Pe films showed very comparable tensile properties, although the elongation at break of SA was higher, while SA + Pe films displayed the lowest elastic modulus and stress at break and the highest elongation at break among the studied samples. The addition of citral EO caused a significant change of the mechanical properties of all the formulations. A general increase of E, σ
 <sub class="sub">y</sub> and σ
 <sub class="sub">b</sub> can be observed, while no significant differences can be noticed for ε
 <sub class="sub">b</sub> (
