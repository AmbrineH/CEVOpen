<p class="p">SA films presented a more homogenous and uniform structure than Pe ones, in accordance with Bierhalz et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], who performed the microstructural analysis on alginate and pectin based films with the addition of natamycin as antimicrobial agent. The addition of citral EO caused a mild change in the structure of all films. Furthermore, some agglomerates can be noticed, possibly indicating a non-uniform distribution of citral EO. The most irregular structure was observed in Pe-based films. The morphology of the films supported the tensile results, evidencing that a different structural arrangement of the components in the film forming dispersion significantly influences both mechanical and gas barrier properties.
