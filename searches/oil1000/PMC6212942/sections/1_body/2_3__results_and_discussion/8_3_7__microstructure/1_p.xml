 <xref rid="B28-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], while conventional plastics are non-polar materials, edible films are usually hydrophilic. The incorporation of essential oil in the film forming dispersion is usually carried out by emulsification or homogenization of the aqueous solution containing the polymer. When the film is dried, droplets of lipid remain embedded into the polymer matrix, as observed by microscopy. The drying time plays an important role in determining the arrangement of the components during the film-forming step, thus the final microstructure of the edible films.
