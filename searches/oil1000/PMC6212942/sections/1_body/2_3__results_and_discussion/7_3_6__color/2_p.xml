<p class="p">All the films were transparent. Since the color of edible films may affect the consumer acceptance, it is of primary importance that its transparency is preserved or that at least they display a color as close as possible to the natural pigment of foods on which the film is going to be applied [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. SA based films showed slightly higher values of L* (luminosity) as compared with those composed of Pe and SA + Pe, in agreement with Galus and Lenart [
 <xref rid="B11-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The addition of citral EO led to a general enhancement of L*. In particular, the increment was of the same entity in the SA samples containing different amounts of citral EO, while for Pe and SA + Pe films the L* values gradually increased with the increment of citral EO content. In terms of a* (red/green index) and b* (yellow/blue index) parameters, the samples containing Pe (both pure or in combination with SA) tended to a more yellowish color. In this case, 0.15 w/w of citral EO significantly enhanced (
