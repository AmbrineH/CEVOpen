<p class="p">Two main degradation steps can be outlined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-11-01980-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The first one, which takes place below 160 °C, is due to film dehydration. The second step, which comprises two distinct peaks (as evidenced by the DTG curves), is related to the decomposition of the film components. In particular, the most evident mass loss (which reached the maximum in the range 210–220 °C), can be ascribed to the degradation of the polymer backbone.
