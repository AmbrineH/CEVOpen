<p class="p">Some differences between the SA and Pe profile can also be highlighted. Indeed, the SA spectrum reveals the presence of two intense peaks at 1602 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1408 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively due to the COO- asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration, and with a weak shoulder at 1298 due to the CO stretching. On the contrary, Pe showed its characteristic band at 1743 cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, assigned to the stretching of the methyl esterified carboxyl groups [

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (due to the COO- asymmetric stretching) was also clearly visible. The IR pattern of the composites presented the peaks of both SA and Pe.
