 <xref rid="B27-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], a typical recommended storage temperature for perishable food items should not exceed 8 °C, with the exception for minced meat that should be stored at 4 °C maximum. Further, in almost all the refrigerators the temperature ranges between 5–8 °C, but it is not uncommon that in certain zones of the refrigerators the temperature increases to values higher than 12 °C.
