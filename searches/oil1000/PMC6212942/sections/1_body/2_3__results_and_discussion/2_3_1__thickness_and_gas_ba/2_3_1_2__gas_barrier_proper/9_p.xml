 <xref rid="materials-11-01980-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> well fit the theoretical relation (high R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value) in most cases, indicating a good correlation between permeability and temperature for both CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. As expected, the higher the temperature, the higher the permeability. In addition, E
 <sub class="sub">GTR</sub> reflected the dependence of the barrier behavior from the temperature for each polymer matrix. The low activation energy demonstrated a low dependence of the gas transmission process on the temperature.
