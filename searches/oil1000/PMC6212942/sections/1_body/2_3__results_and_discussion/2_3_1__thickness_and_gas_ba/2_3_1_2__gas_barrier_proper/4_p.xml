<p class="p">The matrix composition influenced the diffusion of the gas molecules through the polymer, resulting in a substantial variation of the gas transmission. Citral EO caused a modification of the barrier performances, correlated to the compatibility between alginate and pectin, ultimately resulting in effective gas molecule permeation through the films. The impact of lipid addition on the microstructure of the coating films is a determining factor in barrier efficiency. The microstructure of the films is affected by the physical state of the essential oil and its distribution in the polymer matrix. The liquid state of citral EO could favor molecular mobility, promoting the transport of gas molecules through the films. In turn, its distribution is another important factor. The more homogeneous is the distribution, the lower is the GTR. Antarés and Chiralt [

However, a different trend can be described for the materials object of the present study. Indeed, a GTR decrease, particularly evident at lower temperatures, has been observed. The data here presented are well in accordance with the results reported by Rojas-Graü and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. They observed that the introduction of antimicrobials agents (oregano, carvacrol and lemongrass oil) did not affect the oxygen permeability of the films, while a slight decrease was observed by adding citral EO to alginate-based edible films.
