<p class="p">As it is well known, oxygen might cause food oxidation, which in turn influences various food properties such as odour, colour, flavour and nutrient content [

 <xref rid="B25-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The film ability to retard oxidation or degradation of the product is an important characteristic that affects the final product quality and food shelf-life. Therefore, gas barrier properties should be taken into due account. Furthermore, the incorporation of other compounds, such as essential oils, into the polymer matrix could contribute to the modification of their barrier behavior.
