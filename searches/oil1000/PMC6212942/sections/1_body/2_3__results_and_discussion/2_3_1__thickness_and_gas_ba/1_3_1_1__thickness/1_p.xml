 <xref rid="materials-11-01980-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, showing a slight variation of thickness within the different formulations, associated to the film casting technique. This is a crucial parameter for the calculation of mechanical and barrier properties. It depends on the film preparation method, on the flatness of the dish surface and on the film formation during the drying process. Despite the same volume of film forming solutions were used for the film casting, the drying time for complete solvent evaporation increased with the citral EO concentration (anyway remaining in all cases within 5 h). The homogeneity of the films increased with the solvent evaporation time. Consequently, as reported in literature, the thickness tent to be lower in a well-organized and dense network [
