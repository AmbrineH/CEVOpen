<p class="p">All solutions were heated at 70 °C for 30 min under conditions of stirring (until complete dissolution) and homogenized at 5000 rpm for 2 min. Afterwards, about 27 g of solution was used to obtain 1 g of soluble solids in petri dishes (ø 90 mm). Air bubbles were removed by placing the film forming solution under vacuum (60 mbar, 15 min). Films were dried at 40 °C for 5 h to ensure a complete solvent removal, and then stored at room temperature in a desiccator before characterization.</p>
