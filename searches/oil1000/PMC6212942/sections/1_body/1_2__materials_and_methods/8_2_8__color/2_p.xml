<p class="p">The total color difference (ΔE) was calculated using the following equation:
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">ΔE = [(L* − L’)
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> + (a* − a’)
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> + (b* − b’)
  <sup class="sup">2</sup>]
  <sup class="sup">1/2</sup>
  <label class="label">(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where L*, a* and b* are the color parameter values of the sample and L’, a’ and b’ are the color parameter values of the standard white plate used as the film background (L’ = 66.39, a’ = −0.74, b’ = 1.25). The analyses were conducted in five repetitions. A mean value recorded for the top side and bottom side is reported.
