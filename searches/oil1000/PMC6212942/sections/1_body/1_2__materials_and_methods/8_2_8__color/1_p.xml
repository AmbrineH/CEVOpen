<p class="p">The color of film samples was measured using a HunterLab ColorFlex EZ 45/0° color spectro-photometer (Hunterlab, Reston, VA, USA), with D65 illuminant, 10° observer, according to ASTM E308. The measurements were made using CIE Lab scale. The instrument was calibrated with a black and white tile (L* 93.47, a* 0.83, b* 1.33) before the measurements. Results are expressed as L* (luminosity), a* (red/green) and b*(yellow/blue) parameters.</p>
