<p class="p">The determination of the gas barrier properties was performed by a manometric method using a Permeance Testing Device, type GDP-C (Brugger Feinmechanik GmbH, Munchen, Germany), in accordance with the ASTM 1434, DIN 53536, ISO 15105-1 and with the Gas Permeability Testing Manual-2008. The equipment consisted of an upper and a lower chamber, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B19-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The film sample, of approximately 3 cm Ã— 3 cm in size, was placed between the two chambers. A film mask was used to cover the remaining section of the permeation chamber. The top chamber was filled with the dry test gases at ambient pressure. The gas permeation was determined by evaluating the pressure increase in the bottom chamber, which had been previously evacuated. Ambient temperature fluctuations during the test were controlled by an automatic temperature compensation software, which minimizes gas transmission rate (GTR) temperature deviations. The following conditions were adopted: gas stream of 100 cm
