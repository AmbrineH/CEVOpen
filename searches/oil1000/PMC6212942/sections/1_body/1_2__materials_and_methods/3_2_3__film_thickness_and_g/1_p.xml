<p class="p">Film thickness was measured by using a Sample Thickness Tester DM-G, consisting of a digital indicator (MarCator 1086 type, Mahr GmbH, Esslingen, Germany) connected to a PC. The reading was made twice per second measuring a minimum, a maximum and an average value, with a resolution of 0.001 mm. The reported results represent the mean thickness value of three experimental tests run in 10 different positions of each film at room temperature.</p>
