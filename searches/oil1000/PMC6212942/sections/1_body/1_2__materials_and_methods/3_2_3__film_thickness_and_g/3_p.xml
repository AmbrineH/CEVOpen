<p class="p">In order to determine the activation energies of the permeation process, the films were tested at three different temperatures (8, 15 and 23 Â°C), in the same operating conditions as reported above. Chamber and sample temperature were kept constant by an external thermostat HAAKE-Circulator DC10-K15 type (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All experiments were done in triplicate and the results are presented as mean values.</p>
