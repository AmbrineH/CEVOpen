<p class="p">Static contact angle measurements were performed on edible films using a KSV CAM101 (KSV Instrument, Elsinki, Finland) instrument at ambient conditions, by recording the side profiles of deionized water drops (4 µL) deposited on the film surface. The measurement was taken 2 s after the drop deposition to ensure its stabilization, yet to minimize water absorption and evaporation. At least five drops were observed on different areas for each film (both on the top and on the bottom side), and contact angles were reported as the average value ± standard deviation.</p>
