<p class="p">Tensile testing was performed by using a Zwick Roell Texture machine mod. Z2.5 (Ulm, Germany), equipped with a rubber grip and a 500 N load cell. A pre-load of 1MPa with a pre-load speed of 5 mm/min was applied. Stress-strain measurements were performed on rectangular films (5 mm width and 50 mm length) with an initial grip separation of 23 mm and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Five different specimens was analyzed for each film and the results are provided as the average value Â± standard deviation. All measurements have been carried out in accordance with ASTM D882-09.</p>
