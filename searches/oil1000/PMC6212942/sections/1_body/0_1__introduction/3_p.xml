<p class="p">Edible coating and film formulations require several components. At least one of them needs to have structural properties. Between the different compounds that could be used in the formulation, alginate and pectin have been widely investigated [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. They are hydrocolloid compounds coming from respectively seaweed extracts (brown algae) and plant tissue. Both belong to the polyuranoates group and are natural ionic polysaccharides giving rise to a chainâ€“chain association and forming hydrogels. In order to design new films with improved and selective mechanical and barrier properties, it is important to understand their compatibility [

 <xref rid="B12-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Further, essential oils represent a very interesting ingredient for edible film formulation with the purpose of realizing active and natural packaging materials [

 <xref rid="B14-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Due to their natural origin and special functionality (antioxidant/antimicrobial) they could be selected to extend food shelf-life and add value to the product. However, the introduction of edible films for food packaging application may affect several properties such as optical, tensile, permeability and so on [
 <xref rid="B15-materials-11-01980" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. This, in turn, could influence the consumer acceptability. Citral EO was selected since it has been proved to have a positive effect against food spoilage microorganisms, as described by Guerreiro et al. [
