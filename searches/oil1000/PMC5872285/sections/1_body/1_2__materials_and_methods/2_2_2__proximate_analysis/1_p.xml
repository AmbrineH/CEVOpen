<p class="p">Chemical analysis of the LM were determined based on the Association of Analytical Chemists official methods [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Moisture was calculated on a weight basis after freeze-drying whole locust for seven days. Crude fat was extracted from LM (2 g) for 1.5 h in Soxhlet apparatus, using hexane. Fat content was determined gravimetrically after the solvent was evaporated off using a Rotary evaporator (Rotovapor-R, Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland) and a room temperature water bath (Watson Victor Ltd., Buchi 461 Water Bath, Auckland, New Zealand). Crude protein was determined using the Kjeldahl method (Tecator Digestion System 1007 Digester; Kjeltec System 1002 Distilling Unit, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia), with a 6.25 N conversion factor. Ash content was found gravimetrically after drying the sample in a muffle furnace (McGregor, Interlab, Wellington, New Zealand) at 600 Â°C for eight hours. Carbohydrates were determined by difference. Analysis was carried out in triplicate.
