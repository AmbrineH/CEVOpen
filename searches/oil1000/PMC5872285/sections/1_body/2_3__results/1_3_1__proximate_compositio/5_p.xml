<p class="p">In general, the carbohydrate (CHO) content of orthopteran species is low. Mohamed [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] reported 4% CHO and 14% fiber in migratory locusts from Sudan. Although the present study did not separately measure the fiber content, reports indicate a large portion of this is sourced from the polysaccharide chitin, found in the exoskeleton of insects [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Chitin is an interesting fiber, with recent studies identifying populations that commonly consume insects and other chitinous foods, can contain the enzyme chitinase, indicating it may be digestible for certain consumers [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Further investigation into chitin and its digestibility and nutritional benefits are needed with no data concerning migratory locusts currently available. Overall, the high protein, fat, and fiber content found in the present study outline the nutritional benefits of adding locusts to your diet.
