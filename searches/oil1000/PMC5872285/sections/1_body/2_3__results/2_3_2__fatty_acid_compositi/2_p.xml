<p class="p">Many variables influence the FA composition of locusts. For example, the study conducted by Osimani et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] found large differences in SFA and PUFA contents of whole dried locusts samples sourced from either Belgium or the Netherlands. The FA composition of locusts or other insect species is significantly influenced by their diet. Insects that consume grass or plants containing high PUFA are linked to high α-linolenic acid content in the FA composition [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Dreassi et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-09-00020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] found yellow mealworms fed on wheat, oat, cornflour, and chickpea flour had much 10% higher PUFA’s content compared to mealworms fed on 100% oat flour.
