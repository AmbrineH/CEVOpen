<p class="p">Yield and protein recovery of the three fractions, plus the protein content of LM and extracted fractions are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="insects-09-00020-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. The protein contents of the three fractions were not significantly different to each other (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.073). After processing, their combined average protein content (73.6%) was 23.8% higher than the LM, illustrating significantly higher (
