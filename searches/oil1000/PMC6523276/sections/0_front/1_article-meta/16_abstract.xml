 <p class="p">A method was developed to synthesize silver nanoparticles with controlled size and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) wavelength. In a microchip, droplets with high monodispersity and stability were produced. Using droplets as microreactors, seed-mediated growth approach was successfully applied for silver nanoparticles preparation. It was observed that nanoparticles size and LSPR wavelength could be optimized via adjusting synthesis conditions, such as droplets heating temperature, reaction time, and concentration of silver seeds and silver nitrate in aqueous phase. These results indicated that the proposed microdevices could provide a convenient and inexpensive approach for preparing nanoparticles with optimum properties.</p>
