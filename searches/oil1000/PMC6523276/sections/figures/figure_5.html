 <p> ( A) Normalized UV−Vis extinction spectra of samples obtained by varying initial concentration of silver nitrate in the droplets. ( B) Relationship between the in-plane dipole plasmon resonance peak of product nanoparticles and the silver citrate concentration. The initial concentration of silver nitrate was 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0 mM. The amount of seeds for four aqueous phases were 66 μL/mL. The size of microdroplets was ca. 70 μm. The microdroplets were heated at 60 °C for 4 h. </p>
