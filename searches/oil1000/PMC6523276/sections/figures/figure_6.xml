   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Relationship between the in-plane dipole plasmon resonance peak of product nanoparticles and the concentration of seed. The initial reactants concentration in microdroplets was 1 mM for silver nitrate, 10 mM for sodium citrate, and different amount of seeds. The size of microdroplets was ca. 70 μm. The microdroplets were heated at 60 °C for 6 h.
