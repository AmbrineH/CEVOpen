 <p> ( A) Normalized UV−Vis extinction spectra of products extracted from droplets heated at 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C for 4 h. ( B) Relationship between the in-plane dipole plasmon resonance peak of product nanoparticles and heating temperature. The initial reactants concentration in microdroplets was 0.5 mM for silver nitrate, 5 mM for sodium citrate, and 66 μL/mL for seeds. The size of microdroplets was ca. 70 μm. </p>
