 <p> ( A) Photograph and ( B) Normalized UV-Vis extinction spectra of series of as-prepared samples obtained being heated at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h. ( C) Relationship between the in-plane dipole plasmon resonance peak of nanoparticles and the heating time. The initial reactants concentration in microdroplets was 0.5 mM for silver nitrate, 5.0 mM for sodium citrate, and 66 μL/mL for seeds. The size of microdroplets was ca. 70 μm. The reaction temperature was 60 °C. </p>
