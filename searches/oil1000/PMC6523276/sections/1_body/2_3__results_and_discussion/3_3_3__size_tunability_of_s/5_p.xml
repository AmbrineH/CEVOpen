<p class="p">Since sodium citrate can reduce silver nitrate at elevated temperature, the reaction temperature plays a very important role in controlling size of silver nanoparticles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows that just one SPR peak for silver nanoparticles synthesized at 40 and 50 °C, and two LSPR peaks for silver nanoparticles synthesized at 60, 70 and 80 °C. The in-plane dipole resonance bands of silver nanoparticles synthesized at different reaction temperatures bathochromic shifted from 498.5 nm (60 °C) to 553.5 nm (70 °C) and 584 nm (80 °C). Additionally, the peaks located at ~410 nm became intense with the increase of reaction temperature in the range of 60 to 80 °C. When the reaction temperature was not high enough to generate silver seed within 4 h, only growth of initial seed was happened. When the temperature was lower than nucleation temperature, the higher the temperature, the faster the reduction rate, leading to large size silver nanoparticles.
