<p class="p">The amount of added seed can alter the size of final products as well. To investigate the influence of the concentration of seed, the silver nanoparticles were synthesized in microdroplets by reducing silver nitrate with sodium citrate at the surface of added silver seeds with various concentrations. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, the major plasmon band of Ag nanoparticles gradually blue shifted from 538 to 521, 519 and 512 nm as the seeds concentration increased from 33 to 66, 99, and 160 uL/mL, suggesting that the average size of silver nanoparticles decreased with the increase of silver seeds number in the initial reaction solution. A similar result was reported by Jana et al. and Xia et al.
