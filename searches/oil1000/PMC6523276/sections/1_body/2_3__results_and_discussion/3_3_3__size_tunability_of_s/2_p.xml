<p class="p">The obtained Ag nanoparticles synthesized at different heating time were further characterized by TEM. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows TEM images of the silver nanoparticles with sizes increasing from 6.2 to 16.4, 17.4, 23.1, 27.2 and 34.2 nm that were obtained by heating microdroplets at 60 Â°C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. Therefore, the size of silver nanoparticles increased with increasing the microdroplets heating time. The results suggested that microdroplets heating time had a prominent effect on silver nanoparticles size due to the Ostwald ripening. In addition, size distribution also enlarged with increasing time. Terminating the synthesis at different microdroplets heating time could provide a convenient and precise method to control the size of silver nanoparticles over a broad range. The analysis result of UV-Vis spectra was consistent with TEM result. Moreover, the in-plane dipole surface plasmon band has been proved to be a good indicator of general silver nanoparticles. Therefore, we could assess the effect of reaction parameters on the morphology of nanoparticles by analyzing the UV-Vis spectra of obtained silver particles.
