<p class="p">The color of the silver sol could be tuned simply by changing the microdroplets heating time. With the increase of microdroplets heating time, the color of silver sol changed from colorless to yellow and purple (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A). The changes of color reflect changes in the LSPR bands. The seed-mediated growth process of silver nanoparticles was characterized by ultraviolet-to-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of silver nanoparticles synthesized at different microdroplets heating time. The microdroplets heating time is the reaction time for seeds to grow up. Normalized UV-Vis extinction spectrum of Ag nanoparticles synthesized with different heating time are shown in

UV-Vis spectrum of most of those products presented three peaks located at approximately 330 nm (weak shoulder peak), 410 nm and 470 nm. The three peaks could be attributed to the out-of-plane quadrupole, the out-of-plane dipole, and the in-plane dipole Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) modes of a triangular nanoplate, respectively. The in-plane dipole SPR wavelength position of silver nanoparticles bathochromic shifted from 395 to 553 nm with the increase of microdroplets heating time. The in-plane dipole plasmon resonance wavelength was very sensitive to the nanoparticle size and shape, and many literatures reported that the major LSPR peak bathochromic shifted with the increase in the nanosphere or nanoplate size. We could assume that the silver nanoparticles grew with the increase of microdroplets heating time. Compared with the UV-Vis spectrum of seeds, the UV-Vis spectra of products obtained at 1 h and 2 h had one broad absorption peak but bathochromic shifted from the wavelength position of silver seed, indicating the shape of products synthesized with 1 h and 2 h might have little difference with seeds except the size of products was bigger than that of seeds. The absorbance at ~410 nm of products synthesized under 60 Â°C for 3 h, 4 h, and 6 h were larger than absorbance at wavelength of in-plane dipole plasmon resonance of corresponding products. These results could be partly attributed to the presence of small spherical silver nanoparticles.
