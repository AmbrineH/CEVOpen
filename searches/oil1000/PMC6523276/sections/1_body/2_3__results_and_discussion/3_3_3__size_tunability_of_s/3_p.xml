<p class="p">Concentration of silver ions also play an important role in controlling the size of silver nanoparticles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows that one SPR peak located at 439 nm for silver nanoparticles synthesized with 0.25 mM silver nitrate and two LSPR bands for silver nanoparticles synthesized with 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mM silver nitrate. The in-plane dipole resonance bands of silver nanoparticles bathochromic shifting from 497 to 513, and 540 nm were synthesized with 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mM silver nitrate, respectively. These results indicated that an increase of silver cations concentration caused an increase in silver nanoparticles size. The reaction rate was fast for high concentration of silver nitrate since silver cations were essential reactant for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, leading to larger size of silver nanoparticles within the same reaction time.
