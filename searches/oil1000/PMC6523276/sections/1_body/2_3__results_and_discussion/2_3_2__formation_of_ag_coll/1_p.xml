<p class="p">Silver seeds could grow up in the microdroplets by reduction absorbed silver ions at the surface of seed with sodium citrate at 60 째C. Sodium citrate is a mild reducing agent commonly used to synthesize silver or gold nanoparticles at elevated temperature, for example, 100 째C was used in Lee-Meisel method to synthesize silver nanoparticles. In this work, the silver nanoparticles were synthesized by the method of seed-based thermal reduction in microdroplets at 60 째C, a relatively mild condition. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>A, color of aqueous phase turned from nearly colorless to purple after microdroplets containing a mixture solution of silver seeds, silver nitrate and sodium citrate were heated at 60 째C for 6 h, indicating the large silver nanoparticles were obtained.
