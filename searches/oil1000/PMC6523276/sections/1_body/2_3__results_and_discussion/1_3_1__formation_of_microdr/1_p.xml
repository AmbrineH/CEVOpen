<p class="p">In this microfluidic method to synthesize silver nanoparticles, we first produced microdroplets of the initial reaction mixture. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>B shows the process of microdroplets formation in the cross-junction channel of microchip. When aqueous phase encountered water-immiscible oil phase at the cross-junction of channel, the aqueous stream instantly broke up into microdroplets under the combined effect of shear forces and surface tension between continue phase and dispersed phase, surrounded and separated by the oil phase. Under stable fluidic conditions, uniform microdroplets with equal sizes were formed. The microdroplets could keep stable and did not coalesce in the channel of microchip and off microchip (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>C) because the concentration of Span 80 was 1.5 wt %, higher than its critical micelle concentration (CMC) (1.13 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> wt %). To obtain Ag particles with a narrow distribution, the microdroplets need to be uniform and independent of each other, do not coalesce during the long time for silver seed to grow. Before microdroplets were broken by centrifugation to separate Ag particles, microdroplets were collected and stored at 4 °C and heated at 60 °C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows that the size of microdroplets changed a little during those processes for a long time. Therefore, the microdroplets provided a stable environment for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. In addition, the volume of microdroplets can be controlled by changing flow velocity of aqueous phase and oil phase or by changing the geometric construction of channel. Additionally, scaling up the production can be easily realized by extending microdroplets collection time. Compared with segmented flow reactors, the proposed microdroplets reactors could wrap all the reagents and reaction products without the possibility of contamination.
