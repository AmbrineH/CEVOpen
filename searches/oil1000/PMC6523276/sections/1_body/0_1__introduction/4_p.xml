<p class="p">There have been many reports about the synthesis of metal nanoparticles in droplet-based microreactors. Additionally, Pa, Pd, Au, and Ag nanocrystals with controlled sizes and shapes were synthesized in droplet-based microreactor by the group of Xia [

 <xref rid="B26-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The edge lengths of silver nanocubes can be tuned in the range of 30 to 100 nm by changing the reaction time, the amount of silver nitrate, and the amount of silver seeds in the droplets. To prepare silver nanoparticles with controlled size, we constructed microdroplet reactors. Herein, a method of seed-mediated growth was developed, and silver nitrate was reduced by sodium citrate on the surface of silver seeds. The size of obtained silver nanoparticles and the color of the sol could be easily changed by varying the reaction time, heating temperature, and concentration of silver seeds and silver precursors. For instance, nanoparticles size increased and LSPR wavelength bathochromic shifted when the temperature increased (40–80 °C). The LSPR wavelength bathochromic shifted with the increase of droplets heating time or concentration of silver nitrate. This work provided a novel way for synthesizing nanomaterials with high quality.
