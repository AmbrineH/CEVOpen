<p class="p">Another rapidly developing research filed in recent years is droplet microreactors based on microfluidic technology. Droplets can precisely control entire nanoparticles preparation processes. Moreover, the micro-scale size of droplets facilitates the achievement of rapid heat and mass-transfer rates. Droplet microreactors have been proved a powerful tool for biological and chemical reactions [

 <xref rid="B16-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. For example, colloidal nanoparticles were synthesized via the droplet microreactors [

 <xref rid="B19-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. First, the consumption of reagents is small during the process of optimizing reduction condition, especially, for expensive or toxic reagents. Second, the enhanced mass and heat transfers due to the large specific surface area, contribute a better control of reaction concentration and temperature, which govern particle size and size distribution. Third, scaling up the production of nanoparticles can be achieved just by extending the duration of the synthesis, without adjusting other experimental parameters, which not scale linearly with the volume of the reaction solution [

Moreover, droplet microreactors can eliminate concentration dispersion in single phase microreactors and avoid the fouling by reagents or nanocrystal contacting with the inner of channel. These features make droplet microreactors uniquely suitable for synthesizing size-controlled nanomaterials.
