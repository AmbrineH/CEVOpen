<p class="p">Since at least one dimension of silver nanocrystals decreases to the range of 1â€“100 nm, the optical, electronic, catalytic and chemical properties of silver nanoparticles are quite different from bulk metal [
 <xref rid="B1-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Silver nanoparticles have received considerable attention during the past decades due to their unique properties. For instance, with optical properties of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), silver nanostructures were used as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), contrast agents for bioimaging, and biosensors [
 <xref rid="B2-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The intrinsic properties of a silver nanoparticle are mainly depended on particles size, shape, composition, crystallinity, and structure, among which size and shape are more significant [
 <xref rid="B3-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Theoretically, the properties of silver nanoparticle can be regulated by controlling one of these parameters [
 <xref rid="B4-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For example, the high enhancement effect is achieved with hundreds of nanometer-sized particles in SERS [
 <xref rid="B5-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]; while, the optimal size of silver nanoparticles is about 50 nm for nonresonant SERS [
 <xref rid="B6-micromachines-10-00274" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Therefore, achieving well-controlled size and shape is a fundamental requirement for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles with desirable properties.
