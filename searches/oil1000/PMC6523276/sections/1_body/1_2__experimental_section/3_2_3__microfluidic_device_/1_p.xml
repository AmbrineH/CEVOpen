<p class="p">Photolithographic technique was used to fabricate a SU-8 photoresist mold on a silicon wafer (Delta 80, Suss MicroTec, Germany). A mixture of PDMS oligomer and crosslinking agent (10:1, w/w) was cast onto the mold to form a replication, then it was degassed in a vacuum chamber for 30 min and heated in an oven for 2 h at 60 °C for the polymer to cure. After curing, a PDMS replication was removed from the mold and was drilled at the channel inlets. The patterned surface of PDMS replication was treated with corona discharge for 1 min, and then directly bonded to a 2-mm-thick blank PDMS plate. The bonded device was then baked at 60 °C for at least 2 h in an oven.</p>
