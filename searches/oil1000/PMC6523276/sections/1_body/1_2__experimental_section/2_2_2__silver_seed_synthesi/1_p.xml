<p class="p">The silver seed were prepared by using the method reported by Jia et al. In brief, nearly spherical silver nanoparticle seeds (~4 nm on average) were synthesized by drop-wise adding 0.5 mL freshly prepared sodium borohydride solution (50 mM) to a mixture of aqueous silver nitrate (50 mL of 0.1 mM) and TSC (0.5 mL of 30 mM) solution under vigorous stirring.</p>
