<p class="p">A flow focusing microchip (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>A) was used to produce uniform microdroplets containing silver seeds and growth solution at first. The width and height of the microchannel were 100 μm and 100 μm, respectively. Oil phase (continuous phase) and aqueous phase (dispersed phase) were delivered by two syringe pumps (Harvard, PHD 2000) into the microchip to produce microdroplets. In a standard synthesis, a mixture solution of AgNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (5.0 mM, 3.6 mL), TSC (30.0 mM, 6.0 mL), silver seeds (1.0 mL) and pure water (7.4 mL) serving as aqueous phase was introduced into 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>1 at a flow velocity of 14 μL/min, while liquid paraffin with 1.5% (w/w) Span 80 used as oil phase was introduced into 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>2 at a flow velocity of 80 μL/min. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubes with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm were used for connecting the syringes to the microchip inlets, and for transferring the product microdroplets from the microchip outlet to a 50 mL glass vial to collect microdroplets.
