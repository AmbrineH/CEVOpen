<p class="p">The collected microdroplets containing reactants were then heated at 60 Â°C for a period of time to ensure silver seed grow up within microdroplets. During the heating process, aliquots of microdroplets were taken out from glass vial and were centrifuged at 8000 r/min for 10 min to separate aqueous phase from microdroplets, and then at 15,000 r/min for 10 min to precipitate Ag particles from aqueous phase. The as-obtained Ag particles were washed with ethanol once and twice with deionized water before dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication.</p>
