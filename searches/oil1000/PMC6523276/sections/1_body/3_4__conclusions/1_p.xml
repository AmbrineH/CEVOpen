<p class="p">A method to synthesize silver nanoparticles with controlled size and spectral tune ability was developed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00274-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). In this study, nanoparticles were prepared via a simple seed-mediated growth pathway in microdroplets reactors. The size of silver nanoparticles can be controlled by varying the reaction time and temperature, and the initial concentration of silver nitrate and seeds. The results indicated that the average size of silver nanoparticles increased with increasing reaction time, temperature, and concentration of silver cations, and decreased with increasing seed concentration. Moreover, the effect of different preparation conditions on LSPR wavelength was also investigated. We believe that the method possesses a powerful potential to synthesize other size- and morphology-controlled noble metal in continuous flow microdroplet reactors. These obtained nanoparticles with optimum properties are promising substrates to improve SERS detection efficiency for quantitative analysis.
