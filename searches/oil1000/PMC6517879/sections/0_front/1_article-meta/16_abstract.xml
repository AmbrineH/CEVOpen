 <p class="p">The discovery of a new species exhibiting more effective antibacterial properties is necessary because of the demand on 
  <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> species, which continues to increase in a variety of industries. 
  <italic class="italic">Lavandula pubescens</italic> might be a good alternative, as it exhibits strong antibacterial activity. In this study, the chemical composition of the essential oils from different organs (flowers, leaves, stems, and roots) of 
  <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic> was identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activities of different solvent extracts (methanol, ethanol, diethyl ether, hexane, and ethyl acetate) and different organ (flower, leaf, stem, and root) extracts of 
  <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic> were evaluated. Only the ethyl acetate extracts of 
  <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic> exhibited antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains tested, including 
  <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus haemolyticus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> (KF 918342), 
  <italic class="italic">Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> (KCTC 12487), 
  <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (ATCC 35150), 
  <italic class="italic">Cronobacter sakazakii</italic> (ATCC 29544), and 
  <italic class="italic">Aeromonas salmonicida</italic> (KACC 15136). In particular, the extracts exhibited significant activity against 
  <italic class="italic">S. haemolyticus.</italic> Ethyl acetate extract of the leaf exhibited the best activity against all bacterial strains. This study provides valuable information on the chemical compositions in essential oils and antimicrobial properties of 
  <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic>.
