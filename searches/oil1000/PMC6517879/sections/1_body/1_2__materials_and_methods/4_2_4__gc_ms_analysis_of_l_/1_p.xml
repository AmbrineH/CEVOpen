<p class="p">Volatile compounds were extracted and analyzed using a previously reported GC-MS method [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-08-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. GC-MS analysis was performed on a 7820A GC/5977E MSD (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with an HP-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, film thickness 0.25 µm) fused-silica capillary column (Agilent, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. For GC-MS detection, an electron ionization system, with system energy of 70 eV, trap current of 250 µA, and an ion source temperature of 200 °C, was used. The oven temperature program was the same as that described for GC, and injections were used in the splitless mode. The column temperature was maintained at 35 °C for 2 min and programmed as follows: Increase from 50 to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and hold at 250 °C for 10 min. Fresh samples of each plant part (2.0 g) were placed in a 15 mL thermostatted vial that has a rubber septum. During the SPME extraction procedure, the SPME fiber was introduced for 12 h into the thermostatted vial (RT). For this analysis, a 1 cm, 50/30 µm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene/carboxen-coated fiber was used. The fiber was conditioned in a GC injection port for 1 min prior to use. The absorbed component was injected into a gas chromatograph by desorption at 250 °C for 2 min in the injector (splitless mode).
