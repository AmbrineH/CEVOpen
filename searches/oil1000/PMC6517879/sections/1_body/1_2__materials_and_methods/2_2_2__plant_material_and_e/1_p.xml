 <xref rid="B26-foods-08-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The dried plants were then powdered using mortar and pestle and extracted with different solvents, including ethanol, methanol, hexane, ethyl acetate, and diethyl ether, respectively. The powdered sample (10 g) was soaked in 50 mL of the different solvents and incubated in an ultrasound bath (JAC-4020, KODO, Technical Research Co., Ltd., Hwaseong, Korea) for 1 day. The filtrate was then evaporated using a rotary vacuum evaporator (Laborota 4000, Heidolph Instruments Inc., Schwabach, Germany) and stored at 4 Â°C until needed for the antibacterial analysis. For screening of the different plant organs, the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers were collected, powdered, and dissolved in ethyl acetate for 1 day, after which each extract was collected and evaporated, as described above, and dissolved in the same solvent for further use.
