<p class="p">Essential oils, also called volatile or ethereal oils, are defined as an aromatic hydrophobic liquid, including a broad diversity of volatile compounds, and are derived from plant materials, such as the roots, stem, flowers, leaves, buds, seeds, and fruits [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-08-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Lavender essential oils have been used in complementary medicines, in cosmetics, or as food additives for centuries, because these oils have been traditionally regarded as antibacterial, antifungal, carminative, sedative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-depressive agents [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-08-00132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The chemical compounds in the oils, conferring such a biological property, can be classified into two main fractions: A volatile fraction that accounts for 90–95% of the whole oil and contains hydrocarbons (terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes) and oxygenated derivatives generated from hydrocarbons containing phenols, aldehydes, esters, alcohol, oxides, and alcohols. The second non-volatile fraction forms 5–10% of the whole oil and includes waxes, hydrocarbons, sterols, fatty acids, carotenoids, psoralens, coumarins, and flavonoids [
