<p class="p">In this study, 71 volatile compounds were identified in the essential oils derived from the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of 
 <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic> through GC-MS analysis. The most abundant constituents were terpenes, including monoterpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. Similarly, previous studies have shown that terpene metabolites were the major components of essential oils from a variety of 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> species: Barocelli et al. reported a total of 23 constituents in 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula hybrida</italic> Reverchon “Grosso” essential oil, with major constituents such as linalool (33.4%), linalyl acetate (36.2%), camphor (7.6%), and 1,8-cineole (5.8%) [
