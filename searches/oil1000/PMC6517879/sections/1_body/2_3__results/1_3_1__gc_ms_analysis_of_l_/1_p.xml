<p class="p">Chemical composition of the essential oils of different organs of 
 <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic>, such as the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, were identified by GC-MS analysis. Most of the essential oils from different organs were characterized by the dominant presence of terpenes, including monoterpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes (
 <xref rid="foods-08-00132-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The oil from the leaves contained nine monoterpenes—neo-allo-ocimene (21.91%), 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymenene (18.15%), terpinolene (3.31%), isothymol methyl ether (2.8%), 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>-cymene (2.1%), γ-terpinene (1.64%), carvacrol (0.78%), 2,5,5-trimethyl-1,3,6-heptatriene (0.76%), and 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-3-caren-2-ol (0.76%); nine sesquiterpenes—alloaromadendrene (2.45%), caryophyllene (2.45%), β-bisabolene (0.96%), α-muurolene (0.17%), (−)-β-elemene (0.16%), β-ylangene (0.13%), β-guaiene (0.11%), α-calacorene (0.11%), and acoradien (0.07%); and one diterpene—jolkinol D (0.16%), comprising 94.62% of the total leaf-derived essential oil.
