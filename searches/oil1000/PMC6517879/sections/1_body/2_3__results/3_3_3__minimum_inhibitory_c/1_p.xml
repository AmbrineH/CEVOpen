<p class="p">The MIC of crude 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> extract was studied by the micro broth dilution method and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-08-00132-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> ethyl acetate extract at different concentrations inhibited all the growth of all bacterial strain broths. The MIC for 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> was 6.25 µL and for 
 <italic class="italic">S. haemolyticus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. salmonicida</italic> was 12.5 µL. 
 <italic class="italic">Cronobacter sakazakii</italic> inhibition was observed at 25 µL. Streptomycin showed better MIC values in comparison with those of the 
 <italic class="italic">Lavandula</italic> ethyl acetate extracts. MIC values are shown in
