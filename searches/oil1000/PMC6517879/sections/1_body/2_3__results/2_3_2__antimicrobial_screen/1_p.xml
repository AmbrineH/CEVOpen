<p class="p">The antimicrobial screening of 
 <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic> was performed using five different organic solvents. The ethyl acetate extract showed more antimicrobial activity against the six pathogenic bacteria because the disk diffusion method revealed that the ethyl acetate extract produced higher activity than that by the other organic solvents. In particular, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pubescens</italic> possessed significant activity against 
 <italic class="italic">S. haemolyticus,</italic> followed by 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (KF 918342), 
 <italic class="italic">A. hydrophila</italic> (KCTC 12487), 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> (ATCC 35150), 
 <italic class="italic">C. sakazakii</italic> (ATCC 29544), and 
 <italic class="italic">A. salmonicida</italic> (KACC 15136) (

 <italic class="italic">L. pubescens</italic> because it had the strongest activity against all the bacteria. The antibacterial activity against bacterial pathogens using different plant organ extracts in agar plates is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-08-00132-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. The leaf extract exhibited the most powerful antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains, followed by the flower and stem extracts. On the other hand, the roots did not exhibit antimicrobial activity (
