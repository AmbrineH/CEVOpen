 <p class="p">Mosquito-borne infections are a constant problem in Vietnam, and mosquito vector control is a primary approach to control these infections. Essential oils represent environmentally friendly alternatives to synthetic pesticides for mosquito control. The essential oils of two weedy species in Vietnam, 
  <italic class="italic">Erechtites hieraciifolius</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic>, have been obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The essential oils have been screened for mosquito larvicidal activity against 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, and 
  <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. The essential oil from the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> was rich in α-pinene (14.5%), limonene (21.4%), and caryophyllene oxide (15.1%), while 
  <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> essential oil was dominated by myrcene (47.8%) and α-pinene (30.2%). Both essential oils showed good larvicidal activity against 
  <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> (24-h LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 10.5 and 5.8 μg/mL, respectively) and 
  <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> (24-h LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> 10.6 and 12.5 μg/mL, respectively). The essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> also showed good activity against 
  <italic class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae (24-h LC
  <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 40.7 μg/mL). Thus, 
  <italic class="italic">Erechtites</italic> essential oils may serve as low-cost vector control agents for mosquito-borne infections.
