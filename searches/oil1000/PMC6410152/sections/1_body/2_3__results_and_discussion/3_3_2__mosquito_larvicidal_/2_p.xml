<p class="p">The essential oils from the aerial parts of both 
 <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> showed excellent larvicidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>. The 24 h LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values were 10.6 and 12.5 μg/mL, respectively, which compare very favorably with other essential oils reported in the literature against this species [

 <italic class="italic">Erechtites</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> were also very encouraging, with 24 h LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values of 10.5 and 5.8 μg/mL for 
 <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifoliu</italic>, respectively. Notably, the laboratory-reared 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> larvae were more susceptible, based on the 95% confidence limits, to 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> essential oil than the larvae obtained from the wild (24 h LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 42.1 μg/mL). Likewise, wild 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> showed less susceptibility than the laboratory-reared mosquitoes.
