<p class="p">Unfortunately, the 
 <italic class="italic">Erechtites</italic> essential oils also show toxicity to representative non-target organisms, with LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> values against the midge larvae (
 <italic class="italic">C. tentans</italic>) and the zebrafish (
 <italic class="italic">D. rerio</italic>) comparable to those for laboratory-reared mosquito larvae. The small crustacean (
 <italic class="italic">D. magna</italic>) was particularly susceptible to the 
 <italic class="italic">Erechtites</italic> essential oils. Therefore, care must be taken if these essential oils are to be used in broad applications. Local application of 
 <italic class="italic">Erechtites</italic> essential oils (e.g., urban areas) may prove useful as controls for container-breeding mosquitoes, however.
