 <italic class="italic">Erechtites hieraciifolius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> essential oils from other geographical locations have shown wide variations in chemical composition (
 <xref rid="insects-10-00047-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Thus, Î±-phellandrene (41.3%) and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-cymene (22.2%) dominated the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> from Pacoti-Ceara, Brazil [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-10-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], while these compounds were only minor components in the sample from Vietnam. Likewise, dillapiole (33.8%) was the major component in 
 <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> from Parana State, Brazil [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-10-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]; this compound was not observed in the essential oils from Vietnam. The essential oil compositions of 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> from Vietnam were qualitatively similar to those reported by do Amaral and co-workers from southern Brazil [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-10-00047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], but with major quantitative differences.
