<p class="p">As part of our ongoing research on identifying the potential utility of invasive plant species in Vietnam, we have obtained the essential oils from 
 <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> and have examined their mosquito larvicidal activities. In order to assess the potential environmental impact of using 
 <italic class="italic">Erechtites</italic> essential oils as a larvicidal control agent, we have carried out lethality assays on the non-target aquatic species. As far as we are aware, there have been no previous investigations on the larvicidal activities of 
 <italic class="italic">Erechtites</italic> essential oils.
