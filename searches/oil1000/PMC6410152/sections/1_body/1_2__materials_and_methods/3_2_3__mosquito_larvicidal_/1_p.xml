<p class="p">Laboratory-reared larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> were collected from a mosquito colony maintained at the Laboratory of Parasitology and Entomology of Duy Tan University, Da Nang Vietnam. Wild larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (Say) were collected from Hoa Khanh Nam district (16°3′14.9″ N, 108°9′31.2″ E). For the assay, aliquots of the aerial parts (leaves and stems) and essential oils of 
 <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> (Quang Nam stems &amp; leaves) dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (1% stock solution of essential oil in DMSO) were placed in 500 mL beakers and added to water that contained 25 larvae (fourth instar). With each experiment, a set of controls using DMSO was also run for comparison. Mortality was recorded after 24 h and again after 48 h of exposure, during which no nutritional supplement was added. The experiments were carried out at 25 ± 2 °C. Each test was conducted with four replicates with six concentrations (100, 80, 50, 25, 12.5, and 5 μg/mL). Permethrin was used as a positive control.
