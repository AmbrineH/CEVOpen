<p class="p">For the assay against 
 <italic class="italic">Daphnia magna</italic> Straus (Cladocera: Daphniiidae), aliquots of the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">E. hieraciifolius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> (Quang Nam stems and leaves), dissolved in DMSO (1% stock solution), were placed in 250 mL beakers and added to water that contained 20 larvae (fourth instar). Mortality was recorded after 24 h and 48 h of exposure, during which no nutritional supplement was added. The experiments were carried out at 25 ± 2 °C. Each test was conducted with four replicates with five concentrations (12, 6, 3, 1.5, and 0.75 μg/mL). The assay against 
 <italic class="italic">Chiromonus tentans</italic> Fabricius (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae was carried out as above using four replicates with five concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6 μg/mL). For the assay against 
 <italic class="italic">Danio rerio</italic> Hamilton (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae), young, immature fish around 2–3 cm in size were selected for the experiment. Twenty fish were separated in 2.5 L plastic containers with 1.0 L of tap water, with a temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and external relative humidity of 85%. For each dose (100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6 μg/mL), four repetitions of the experiment were performed. The mortality of organism non-target was calculated following an exposure period of 24 h. With each experiment, a set of controls using DMSO was also run for comparison.
