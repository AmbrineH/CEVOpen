 <italic class="italic">Erechtites hieraciifolius</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. valerianifolius</italic> are introduced weedy species that grow prolifically in Vietnam, particularly where forests have been cleared; acquisition of abundant quantities of plant material should not be a problem. Mosquito larvicidal screening of these two species indicates good larvicidal activity, which can be attributed to their major components. Thus, this work provides evidence that otherwise noxious introduced weeds might provide low-cost vector control agents to prevent the spread of arboviral infections in Vietnam.
