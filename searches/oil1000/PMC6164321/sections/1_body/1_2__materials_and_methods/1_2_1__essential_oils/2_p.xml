<p class="p">After preliminary results about the efficacy of each EO, mixtures have been made with the most active ones. Mixtures were prepared with 1:1 proportion (

 <italic class="italic">w</italic>) of 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> (M1), 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> (M2), 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> (M3), as well as for 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanicum</italic> (M5) together with a mixture of three EOs (M4) obtained with 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> (1:1:1). All EOs and mixtures were maintained at 4 °C in dark glass vials until their use. Then they were microbiologically analyzed for quality control before antibacterial and antimycotic activity tests. At this purpose, a loopful of each EO was streaked onto a blood agar plate and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.
