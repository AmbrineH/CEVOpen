<p class="p">HCA analysis gave only limited information; therefore, a further statistical analysis was important to better understand this partition. PCA plot, where the two first axis explain for more than 98.3% of variability, grouped the EOs species among 3 main quadrants: two lower quadrants characterised by high amount of monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH) on the left and by an important percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes (OM) on the right. The upper left quadrant included two EOs (clove and cinnamon) and their mixture M5, in which the amount of phenylpropanoids (PP) was more than 60% (
