<p class="p">The position of the mixtures in PCA analysis followed the EOs that took part in their composition. In fact, M1 was located in the right lower quadrant as well as 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> with a content of 80.0% of MH. Moreover, M2 was found in the middle between 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic>, while M3 was positioned between 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic>. M4, which was obtained mixing three EOs (
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic>, 1:1:1) was shifted on the right quadrant due to the high percentage of OM (56.0%).
