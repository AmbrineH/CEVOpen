<p class="p">In detail, the EOs present in the lower left quadrant all belonged to Sapindales order. Among these species, 
 <italic class="italic">C. reticulata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. aurantium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. limon</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic> belonged to the same Rutaceae family. The first three species showed the highest percentage of MH (99.7%, 97.4% and 94.3%, respectively) while 
 <italic class="italic">C. bergamia</italic> evidenced an equivalent amount between MH and OM (49.0% and 48.5%, respectively). Bergamot was therefore positioned in the middle between EOs characterised by an important percentage of MH and OM. 
 <italic class="italic">B. sacra</italic>, which belongs to the Burseraceae family in the Sapindales order, showed a good percentage of MH (84.3%) and was near the other 
 <italic class="italic">Citrus</italic> spp. Regarding Lamiales order, only 
 <italic class="italic">L. hybrida</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. piperita</italic> were present in the lower right quadrant of PCA, due to the high amount of OM (85.0% and 87.8%, respectively), together with 
 <italic class="italic">E. globulus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. graveolens</italic> characterized by a similar high percentage of the same constituents (OM: 90.5, 86.3 and 83.4%, respectively). The other two EOs from species belonging to Lamiaceae, showed some distance from each other: in fact, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> presented a lower percentage of OM (56.1%) but also the highest amount of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (SH) (20.0%) and was positioned in the upper right quadrant, while lemon verbena, which belongs to the Verbenaceae family (Lamiales order), was on the opposite side due to its relevant amount of MH (66.0%).
