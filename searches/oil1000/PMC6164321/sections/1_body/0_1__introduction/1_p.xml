 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> are two pathogen agents which are largely present in poultry flocks and can cause able to cause mild or severe forms of disease associated with economic losses. Improper hygiene conditions and animal immune system deficiencies would influence the severity of the infection outcome. Environmental stressors such as poor ventilation, warm temperature, excessive ammonia and moisture, degraded litters, long-term storage of feed may increase the concentration of fungal spores and bacteria in the farm environment [
