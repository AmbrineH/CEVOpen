<p class="p">The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition and the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sixteen EOs derived from different botanical species, alone or in mixture, against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. fumigatus</italic> strains previously isolated from poultry. EOs were chosen on the basis of their commercial availability, odor characters and no toxicity in view of a possible environmental use.
