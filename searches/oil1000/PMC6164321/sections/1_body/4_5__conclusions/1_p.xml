<p class="p">This investigation shows promising results in order to use EOs for disinfection purposes in poultry farms and/or in hatcheries environment. The mixture with 
 <italic class="italic">C. zeylanimcum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. aromaticum</italic> could be a useful alternative treatment against 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">C. citratus</italic> used alone could be employed to fight both 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. fumigatus</italic>, while 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> EO would be used to enhance the control of sporesâ€™ burden, aiming to reduce the risk of infection for both animals and workers.
