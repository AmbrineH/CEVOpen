 <italic class="italic">L. cubeba</italic> EO has a relevant anti-
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> activity, as previously observed by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], who documented holes and gaps on outer and inner membranes of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> cells treated with this EO, mainly attributed to the presence of aldehydes as geranial (36.4%) and neral (32.5%).
