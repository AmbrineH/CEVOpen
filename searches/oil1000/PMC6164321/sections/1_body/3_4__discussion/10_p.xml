 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> EO showed an interesting antifungal activity. Its composition is characterized by a 24% of sabinene, 36.7% of limonene and 12% of citronellal. The antifungal activity is probably due to sabinene, which appeared effective against 
 <italic class="italic">A. fumigatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], as well as to citronellal [
 <xref rid="B33-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Moreover, the present data are in full agreement with Correa-Royero et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], who reported effectiveness against 
 <italic class="italic">A. fumigatus</italic> at 99.2 Âµg/mL. 
 <italic class="italic">A. triphylla</italic> was successfully assayed against 
 <italic class="italic">Candida</italic> spp. both as EO [
 <xref rid="B35-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and as ethanolic extract [
 <xref rid="B37-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], while it was not effective against 
 <italic class="italic">Trichoderma viride</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-vetsci-05-00062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>].
