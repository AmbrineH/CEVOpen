 <p> Flowchart for the synthesis of IONPs by co-precipitation [ 19]. In this example, Fe 3O 4 NPs are prepared from a mixture of FeSO 4 and FeCl 3 in the molar ratio of 1:2. Magnetic phase and particle size can be adjusted by varying Fe 2+/Fe 3+ ratio, temperature, pH, and the type of base used. </p>
