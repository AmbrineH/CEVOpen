  <p class="p">Interference of IONPs with CNS iron homeostasis and its involvement in neurodegeneration process. (1) IONPs in the bloodstream can alter the permeability of BBB. The integrity of BBB can be damaged by ROS production and/or inhibition of Occludin-proteins (belonging to tight junctions proteins TJ); (2) based on their size, surface charge and coating IONPs are subject to the formation of protein corona around IONPs, leading to opsonization phenomena. This can alter physicochemical properties of IONPs and/or improve transport across BBB; (3) IONPs can be also eliminated from blood circulation by means of recognition and uptake by monocytes or other cells of Mononuclear Phagocytic System; (4) IONPs can cross BBB by means of paracellular or transcellular mechanism and enter in CNS [
