<p class="p">In the last decades, the power of nanotechnology in numerous fields including biomedical sciences has been exploited. Nanoparticles (NPs) are solid colloidal particles ranging in size from 1 to 100 nm. Due to their dimensions comparable with those of cells, viruses, proteins, and genes, they opened the potentiality of interacting with fundamental biological processes [

Among them, engineered Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs) made of iron, cobalt, or nickel oxides exhibit special properties, including high surface-to-volume ratio and high magnetic moment, allowing potential manipulation by an external magnetic field [
