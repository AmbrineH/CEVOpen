<p class="p">The enhancement of effective drug delivery by magnetic driving of sensitive MNPs has been especially explored to treat diseases of the Central Nervous System (CNS). In fact, due to the aging of the population, CNS pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly becoming a relevant medical and social issue [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Current pharmacological treatments are mainly based on the systemic delivery of active substances into the CNS, whose effectiveness is seriously limited due to the presence of blood-brain-barrier (BBB). MNPs are therefore considered powerful tools to cross BBB by means of physical mechanisms and properly deliver the drug cargo in the brain. There are many in vitro and in vivo evidences of BBB trespassing by MNPs under magnetic fields to deliver therapeutic agents in the CNS [
