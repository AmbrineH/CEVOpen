<p class="p">Several steps have to be taken into account to design MNPs suitable for magnetic drug delivery in CNS. Currently, many methods of synthesis are available making it possible to produce a wide spectrum of different MNPs, by optimizing protocols, in order to obtain the best physicochemical properties [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Focusing on IONPs, they are usually made of a crystalline core and a surface coating (e.g., dextran, citrate, chitosan, polyethylene glycol, albumin, etc.), whose dimensions are tunable to improve their stability, enhance their biocompatibility, and optimize their bio-distribution. NP coating may be modified with specific targeting molecules or drugs. This variety of physical features and coatings characterizes IONP action mechanisms and toxicity patterns [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Moreover, since the synthesis methods affect the IONP size distribution, the degree of structural defects, the surface chemistry, and the magnetic behavior, they finally also determine the interaction with biological barriers—such as BBB and lipid bilayer of a cell membrane—and the consequent biocompatibility in the living organisms [
