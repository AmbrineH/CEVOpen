<p class="p">Furthermore, special attention must be paid to the assessment of biocompatibility and potential risk associated with the IONPs exposure. The low toxicity of IONPs is generally assumed, but since results are often contradictory, further investigation is required, also developing innovative cell models to test it. This is a crucial point due to the high vulnerability of CNS for iron imbalance, especially in the alterations of iron homeostasis strongly connected with neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
