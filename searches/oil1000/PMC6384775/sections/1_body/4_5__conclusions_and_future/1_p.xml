<p class="p">Due to their unique physicochemical properties, IONPs are considered as one of the most promising tools for biomedical applications because of magnetic driving via external field. In particular, IONPs could be ideal for the physical targeting of CNS, optimizing the crossing of BBB and the drug delivery into the brain. For this reason, the development of engineered IONPs by means of controllable synthesis methods and a careful tuning of their properties are in constant progression.</p>
