<p class="p">This review provides an up-to-date overview about the possible strategies to successfully design suitable IONPs able to move from the proof-of-concept level to future clinical settings. The need of an accurate selection of physicochemical properties, such as size, shape, and structure, adjusting the parameters of the synthesis process is the first required step. At the same level, the functionalization of IONPs with different polymers or chemical compound is essential for the improvement of various biomedical applications in CNS. A deeper investigation on the magnetic characterization of IONPs is necessary, in order to better understand the interaction of IONPs with the external magnetic field used as a driving/delivery system. The emergent property of superparamagnetism makes IONPs appealing nanomaterials, as proved by the large number of current studies focused on the detailed analysis of magnetic properties, such as saturation magnetization, coercive field, and remnant magnetization. These parameters are critical for the interplay with the applied magnetic field, allowing the modulation of magnetic-driven nanocarriers in the biological environment.</p>
