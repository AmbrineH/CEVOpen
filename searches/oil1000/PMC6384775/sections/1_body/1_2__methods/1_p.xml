<p class="p">PRISMA guidelines were followed for the collection and selection of the reported papers (
 <uri xlink:href="http://prisma-statement.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://prisma-statement.org</uri>). PubMed and ScienceDirect were used as scientific reference resources. Initially, searches were limited to the articles published in English in the last 2 years and up to December 2018, mainly because of the fast obsolescence of the literature related to this rapidly evolving scientific field. Combinations of the following keywords were used: Iron oxide, magnetic, nanoparticles, synthesis, properties, magnetization, functionalization, central nervous system, and toxicity. The logical combination of the keywords used for the query has been:
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Iron oxide AND magnetic AND nanoparticles AND synthesis AND central nervous system</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">OR</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Iron oxide AND nanoparticles AND magnetization AND properties AND central nervous system</p>
  </list-item>
