<p class="p">After the removal of duplicates from query results, relevant papers were chosen by reading titles and abstract content, based on the following criteria: Description of synthesis methods and functionalization of IONPs; possibly containing data on magnetic characterization; possibly containing data about the toxicity on CNS target cells (neurons or glial cells). In general, only those papers concerning CNS biomedical applications of iron oxide NPs, possibly steered by magnetic force, were retained for subsequent discussion. On the contrary, papers describing MNPs made of different materials or addressing the issue of targeting body districts different from CNS, were generally discarded. Finally, the so filtered papers—comprised of both original research articles and reviews—were integrally read and their bibliography was manually screened to additionally retrieve the largest number of seminal works upon which the recent and most relevant literature is founded.</p>
