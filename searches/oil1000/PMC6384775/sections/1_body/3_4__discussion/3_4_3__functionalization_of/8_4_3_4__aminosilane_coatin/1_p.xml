<p class="p">Aminosilane (AmS) coated IONPs are widley used as a multifunctional drug delivery system. Surface modification of IONPs by AmS can indeed prevent aggregation and allows the addition of specific functionalities to IONPs [

 <xref rid="B98-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. As for their biocompatibility, it has been shown that AmS-coated particles affected cell metabolic activity only at high concentrations (around 200 μg/mL), while leaving the membrane intact [
