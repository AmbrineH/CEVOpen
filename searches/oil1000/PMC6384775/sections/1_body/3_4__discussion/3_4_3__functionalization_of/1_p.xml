<p class="p">The most important limitation to drug delivery in the brain is the presence of the BBB, which virtually inhibit the diffusion of the majority of substances to neurons [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. IONPs can be used to overcome this limitation, but attention has to be posed to possible induced neurotoxicity caused by their oxidation and to mechanisms for enhancing and/or controlling the barrier trespassing [
 <xref rid="B9-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Naked IONPs without coating face many problems such as the aggregation in water, chemical instability in the air, poor biodegradability in the physiological environment, and non-specific interaction with serum protein [
 <xref rid="B86-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. To prevent iron oxidation and to minimize the direct exposure of the biological surfaces to IONPs, coating with a biocompatible shell is required. The interaction with cells and functionalized NPs strongly depends on the inorganic or organic materials used [
