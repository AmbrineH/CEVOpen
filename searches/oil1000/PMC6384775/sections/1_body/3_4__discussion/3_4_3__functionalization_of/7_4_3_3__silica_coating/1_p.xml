<p class="p">Silica is the most used compound for surface coating of IONPs to reduce the toxicity [
 <xref rid="B93-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Silica coating is widely applied to the surface functionalization of NPs and also to improve stability in water and it protects them in an acidic environment [
 <xref rid="B51-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In general, silica coating increases the particle size and modifies the magnetic properties of IONPs. It helps in binding with the various ligands at the surface and provides a protective layer for drug molecules and IONP itself [
 <xref rid="B94-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. As listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-12-00465-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, different methods of silica coating for the IONPs exist. In addition, small molecules such as dyes, drugs, and even quantum dots can be consolidated into the silica shell during its formation. Silica surface can be covalently attached to different ligands and biomolecules to target organs via antibody-antigen recognition [
 <xref rid="B95-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. Moreover, silica coating enhances colloidal stability with a relatively easy regulation of the coating process, and as already stated, it can contribute to reduce the IONPs toxicity, a particularly critical aspect for all the CNS applications [
