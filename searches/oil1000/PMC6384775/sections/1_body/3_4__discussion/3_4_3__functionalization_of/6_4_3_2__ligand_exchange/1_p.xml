<p class="p">Ligand exchange is the most commonly used method for controlling the surface properties of IONPs [
 <xref rid="B91-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. The hydrophobic nature of the IONPs can be switched to hydrophilic by ligand exchange [
 <xref rid="B92-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. In the ligand exchange a new type of functional group replaces the initial hydrocarbon layer directly. The new ligand contains two different kinds of functional groups: 1) Functional groups, which can directly link to the surface of the IONPs tightly by the effect of their chemical bonding; and 2) other functional groups that help particles dissolve in water solution [
