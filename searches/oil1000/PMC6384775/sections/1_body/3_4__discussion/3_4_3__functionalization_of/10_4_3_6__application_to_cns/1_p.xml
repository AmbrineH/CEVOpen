<p class="p">In recent years, IONPs functionalized by means of different types of coating were investigated for the treatment of important CNS pathologies. The improvement of biocompatibility with respect to naked IONPs is a crucial point of their surface modifications. In this regard, silica-coated SPIONs showed good biocompatibility and an effective magnetic-guided deliverability into the diseased brain regions [

Alternatively, the coating of SPIONs by means of organic materials also provided high safety levels, allowing a more extensive use of these agents in the current and future CNS applications. For example, the stability of dextran-SPIONs for MRI application following storage at different temperatures was monitored in Reference [

Chitosan is another natural polymer used in various CNS application, such as drug delivery. The main benefit deriving from chitosan coating consists in the support function it can provide for different type of drugs, without impairing the NP properties. Unfortunately, chitosan presents also some limitations due to its reduced solubility in water at physiological pH, thus making chemical changes for improved water-solubility necessary [

 <xref rid="B105-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Overall, these findings point out that polymeric coating is one of the most powerful strategies for improving the internalization of IONPs by the endothelial cells of the BBB and the consequent release in the CNS. In particular, dextran, chitosan, and also polyethylene glycol are the best candidates to study optimized formulations of coated IONPs and improve targeted drug transport across BBB.
