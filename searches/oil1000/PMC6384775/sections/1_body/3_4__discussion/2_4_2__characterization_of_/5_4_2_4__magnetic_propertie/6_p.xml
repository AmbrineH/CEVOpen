In fact, when the external magnetic field is switched off, the magnetic domains point at random orientation, with zero resultant. The degree of alignment of magnetic moments depends on temperature, it decreases when the temperature increases and vanishes beyond a critical temperature, where the magnetization becomes zero. Above this critical temperature (i.e., blocking temperature

Working with SPIONs in the biomedical field is highly recommended, because of their high magnetization response under external field interaction and their no zero magnetization behavior without applied field, avoiding the risk of agglomeration, and reciprocal attraction [
