<p class="p">Different critical sizes have been investigated for IONPs, but typically the optimal range for biological applications is considered around 10â€“100 nm. For instance, Li and colleagues studied the transition from multi to single-domain, establishing the critical size value (~76 nm) for highly crystalline cube-Fe
