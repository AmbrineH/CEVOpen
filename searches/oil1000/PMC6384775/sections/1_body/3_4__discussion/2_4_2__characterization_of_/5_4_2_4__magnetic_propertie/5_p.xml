<p class="p">The dimension of IONPs, determines the surface-to-volume ratio in turn linked with their reactivity, also responsible for attraction and agglomeration phenomena. In fact, IONPs magnetism is dominated by size effects, due to the magnetic domain structure of ferromagnetic material (i.e., Weiss domain, volume in which all atomic magnetic dipole are aligned). In 1930, Frenkel and Dorfman suggested the principle of the superparamagnetism theory, stating that ferromagnetic materials transfer from multi-domains to a single-domain state by particle resizing to nanoscale (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00465-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>b). The existence of a critical size at which the transition to single-domain (i.e., state of uniform magnetization) occurs is well established in the literature. It happens when the magnetic energy configuration of multi-domains is no more favorable compared to the single domain: The gain in energy through the division is less then than the energy of the domain wall. It can be calculated analytically [
