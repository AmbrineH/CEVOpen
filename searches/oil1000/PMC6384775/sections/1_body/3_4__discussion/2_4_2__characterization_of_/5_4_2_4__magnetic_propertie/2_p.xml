 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot1-materials-12-00465" class="xref">Section 4.1</xref>, many methods have been developed for IONPs production allowing shape, size and structure controlled synthesis [

 <xref rid="B70-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The methods most used in the biomedical field are thermal decomposition of metallic precursors, co-precipitation, and hydrothermal synthesis, in which pressure and reaction temperature values are critical to control the growth and nucleation of IONPs from solution [
 <xref rid="B4-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Many researchers successfully applied these methods for IONPs, in order to obtain nanostructures with various shapes [

 <xref rid="B72-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Additionally, efforts have been applied not only for the synthesis of 0-dimensional IONPs, but also of 1 and 3-dimensional structures, developed via a microwave-assisted procedure, also showing that sophisticated morphology (i.e., Fe

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> nanotubes or elliptical nanorings) has effective magnetic properties [
 <xref rid="B73-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. In summary, different morphology and dimensions can be obtained by carefully adjusting the main parameters of the reactions during the synthesis process such as heating temperature, molar ratio, or concentration of the reactants.
