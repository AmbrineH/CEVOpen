<p class="p">The various materials can be classified by different form of magnetic behaviors, based on their response to an external magnetic field that, at the microscopic level, interacts with atomic dipoles, causing a measurable macroscopic magnetic moment. Five basic types of magnetism are known: Diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and ferrimagnetism. Ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are the most interesting ones, exhibiting remarkable magnetic properties. In particular, ferromagnetic materials show a high magnetization 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> during the interaction with the applied field 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>. The magnetization does not increase indefinitely, but reaches asymptotically the saturation magnetization 
 <italic class="italic">M
  <sub class="sub">s</sub>
 </italic>. After turning off the external field 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic> a little amount of residual magnetization, 
 <italic class="italic">M
  <sub class="sub">r</sub>

 <italic class="italic">H</italic> and
