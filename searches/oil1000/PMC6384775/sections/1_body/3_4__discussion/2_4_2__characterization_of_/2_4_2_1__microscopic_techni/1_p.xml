<p class="p">Due to the very high resolution achieved by electron microscopy (&lt;1 nm), both Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are widely used to determine, respectively, the surface morphology and the inner structure of NPs. Unlike SEM that produces images making use of reflected (or knocked-off) electrons, TEM indeed works by detecting transmitted electrons that may carry valuable information on the IONP inner structure (e.g., crystal structure, stress state, and more) [
