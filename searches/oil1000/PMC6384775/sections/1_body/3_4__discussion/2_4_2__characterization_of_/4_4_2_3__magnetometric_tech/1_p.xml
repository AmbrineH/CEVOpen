<p class="p">The magnetic properties of IONPs can be assessed by measuring the magnetization of a samples when subjected to an externally applied magnetic field 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic> varying from âˆ’10,000 Oe to 10,000 Oe, at a defined temperature. The Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) are the most common techniques able to measure important magnetic parameters of MNPs, such as saturation magnetization, coercive field, and remnant magnetization [

 <xref rid="B66-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. To date, these measurements represent an essential characterization step, because of the interplay between MNPs and the external magnetic fields employed for magnetic-driven nanocarriers as useful strategies for numerous biomedical applications. In the next section of this review, the magnetic properties of MNPs and their link with the methods of synthesis are investigated in more detail.
