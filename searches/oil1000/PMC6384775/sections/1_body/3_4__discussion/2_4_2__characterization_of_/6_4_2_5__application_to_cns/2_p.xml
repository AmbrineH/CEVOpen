<p class="p">Finally, the magnetic properties are critical for the passage of IONPs across the endothelial monolayer. Static magnetic fields can facilitate the entry of IONPs into the brain side and the proper delivery of their drug cargo. In addition, alternating magnetic fields can increment BBB permeability by magnetic heating [

This study provides evidence for the great potentiality of the coordinated use of magnetic forces for nondestructive BBB crossing and the site-specific delivery of therapeutics to treat CNS diseases, such as Alzheimerâ€™s and brain tumors.
