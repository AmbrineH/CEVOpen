<p class="p">Focusing on CNS applications, the characterization of IONPs is fundamental to elucidate phenomena such as interaction with magnetic field and agglomeration. In this context, the main uses of IONPs are as a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as heating sources in hyperthermia, and as targeted drug-carriers with BBB-crossing capabilities [

Shevtsov and colleagues studied chitosan-dextran SPIONs for the treatment of glioblastoma, the most devastating brain cancer [

The accumulation of NPs in the tumor cells was evaluated by means of histological studies and such SPIONs exhibited enhanced properties for the targeted delivery of chemotherapy and for the delineation of the tumor mass in the brain. Moreover, the synthesis strategy described in [
