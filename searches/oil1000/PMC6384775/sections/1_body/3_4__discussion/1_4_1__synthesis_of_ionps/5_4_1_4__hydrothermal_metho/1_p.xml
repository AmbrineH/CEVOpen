<p class="p">A broad range of crystalline IONPs can be synthetized by using the hydrothermal method. The general system consists of (solid) metal linoleate, an ethanol-linoleic acid liquid phase, and water-ethanol solution kept under hydrothermal (i.e., high-temperature and high-pressure) conditions [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Specifically, the typical reaction temperature to perform hydrothermal synthesis is around 220 Â°C, while the required pressure is above 10

Usually, a temperature gradient is created within a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave whose cooler end will host the deposition of the mineral solute, finally growing the desired crystal. Through this technique, shape and size of the resulting NPs are generally very uniform, with the possibility of tuning NP size from few nanometers to several hundred (see
