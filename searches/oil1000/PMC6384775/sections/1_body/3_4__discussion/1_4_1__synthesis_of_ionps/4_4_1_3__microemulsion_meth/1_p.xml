<p class="p">The microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable dispersion of two immiscible liquids in the presence of a surfactant, which forms a monolayer at the interface between oil and water, possibly exhibiting an ultralow interfacial tension [

 <xref rid="B28-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The physicochemical properties of NPs prepared by such a technique essentially depend upon the choice of the surfactant. Specifically, nanoparticles result in spherical shape, nearly monodispersed, with an average diameter ranging between 10 and 25 nm [
