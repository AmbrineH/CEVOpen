<p class="p">A commonly used physical way for IONP synthesis is the so-called sputter deposition. By this technique, Fe atoms are extracted from a solid iron target material (working as a cathode) after its bombardment through energetic particles. Iron atoms sputtered—for instance—by a high-pressure magnetron-sputtering gun are subsequently decelerated into a cooled growth chamber as a result of their collisions with the atoms of Ar and He gas present in the chamber. The so formed iron NPs are then ejected from the aggregation chamber through a pressure gradient system and then deposited onto a sample holder in the adjacent deposition chamber. Afterwards, a small amount of oxygen is introduced in the deposition chamber to allow the oxidation (Fe
