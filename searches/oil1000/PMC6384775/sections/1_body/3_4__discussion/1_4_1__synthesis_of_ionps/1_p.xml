<p class="p">The most commonly used materials for the synthesis of MNPs consist of compounds (usually oxides) of iron, cobalt, or nickel, in combination with other metals such as copper, zinc, strontium, and barium. However, as already mentioned, this review focuses only on those procedures and precursor compounds suitable for the production of iron oxide MNPs. In general, the synthesis of MNPs is a very critical multistep procedure, which must be optimized since its early design phase, given that even a small variation in the production process can significantly change the desired outcome [

Specifically, depending on the desired features and on the final field of application, three main routes for IONP preparation have been developed during last decades: Chemical, physical, and biological, the former comprising about the 90% of all synthesis methods (
