<p class="p">Thermal decomposition is one of the most effective methods to produce narrow size distribution MNPs, also allowing for the fine-tuning of particle mean diameter [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In particular, thermal decomposition can be achieved by two different protocols, namely “heating-up” and “hot-injection”. The heating-up process implies the continuous heating of a pre-mixed solution of precursor compounds, surfactants, and solvent, up to a given temperature at which NPs start clustering and growing [

 <xref rid="B24-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. On the contrary, the hot-injection method induces a fast and homogeneous nucleation by injecting reagents into a hot surfactant solution followed by a controlled growth phase. In any case, both the processes are based on the same principle consisting in heating a non-magnetic organometallic precursor compound in the presence of organic solvents and surfactants [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Usually, iron carbonyls and acetylacetonates are used as non-magnetic precursors, while fatty acids, rather than oleic acid, are commonly used as surfactants [

The optimal temperature required for this reaction ranges between 100 °C and 350 °C, leading to the production of crystalline MNPs sized between 4 and 30 nm in diameter (

 <xref rid="B26-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In this context, temperature and time of reaction are important factors to control particle size.
