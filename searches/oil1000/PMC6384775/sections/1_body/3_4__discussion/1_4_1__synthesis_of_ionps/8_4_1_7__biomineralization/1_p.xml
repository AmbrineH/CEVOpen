<p class="p">Many living organisms—including humans—have a genetically encoded ability to synthesize minerals and other inorganic substances in a process known as bio-mineralization. In particular, some species are able to produce “biogenic” magnetic nanoparticles on which they base their sense of direction. For example, magnetotactic bacteria can generate magnetosomes (protein-coated nanosized crystals of magnetic iron oxide) [
