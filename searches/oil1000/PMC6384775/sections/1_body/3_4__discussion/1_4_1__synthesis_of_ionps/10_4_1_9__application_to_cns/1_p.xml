<p class="p">As well as an improved biocompatibility and bioavailability, IONPs provide specific advantages for the treatment of neurological disorders based on their possibility to be imaged and externally driven through magnetic scanners for a targeted drug-delivery (theranostic approach). Importantly, external static magnetic fields could also be used to enhance BBB permeability against IONPs, whereas alternating magnetic fields are suitable for selectively killing tumor cells via localized hyperthermia [

On the other hand, the main advantage of co-precipitation, hydrothermal and biomineralization synthesis is that they do not require harmful solvents—water being the most used ones—for the preparation of IONPs, thus reducing their toxic potential, especially on neurons [
