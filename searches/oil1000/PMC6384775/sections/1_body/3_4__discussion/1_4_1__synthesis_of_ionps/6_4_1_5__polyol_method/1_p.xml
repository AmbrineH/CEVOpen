<p class="p">The polyol method allows synthetizing uniform MNPs at a relatively low temperature and it is based on precursor compounds such as oxides, acetates and nitrates dissolved or suspended in diols (

It is a versatile and up-scalable method suitable for the production of large batches of IONPs, encompassing a wide range of possible size, from ultra-small spheres of 4 nm in diameter to larger ones up to 100 nm, depending on reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, reaction time, heating profile, nature of the polyol solvent, or organometallic precursors) [
