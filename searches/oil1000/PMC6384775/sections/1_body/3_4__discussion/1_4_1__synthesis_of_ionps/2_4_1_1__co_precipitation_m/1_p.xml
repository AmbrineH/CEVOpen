<p class="p">The co-precipitation method is probably the most popular method for IONP synthesis. In particular, it is widely used in biomedical applications, because of the non-toxic nature of the materials usually employed [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The term “co-precipitation” refers to the phenomenon by which a precipitate can carry down one or more substance—normally soluble in those particular conditions—through nucleation and grain growth. This method allows MNPs to be synthesized in an inert nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature [

 <xref rid="B18-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Through the co-precipitation synthesis, it is possible to obtain MNPs broadly distributed around a mean diameter value ranging from 5 to 40 nm (
