<p class="p">Focusing on IONPs, their physicochemical features, such as size, shape, surface charge, and coatings, determine their cytotoxicity. For example, IONPs of few nanometers (approximatively &lt;10 nm) are more toxic than larger ones, which cannot enter the nucleus. The dimension of IONPs is also a significant factor for the biodistribution at body level, affecting the blood circulation time and the filtration from spleen, liver, or kidneys [
