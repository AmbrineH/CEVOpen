<p class="p">In general, IONPs are assumed to be biocompatible, but upon intracellular degradation, IONPs do release iron ions, influencing iron homeostasis at general body level. Especially, due to the high vulnerability of CNS for iron imbalance, much work still has to be done to fully understand how different types of IONPs could affect the brain, BBB (see

Yarjanli and colleagues reviewed a large number of studies concluding that IONPs, according to their physicochemical properties, can lead to iron accumulation, oxidative stress, protein aggregation in the neural cells, and may induce neurodegeneration [

Additionally, the review of Xie and coworkers evaluated the close links between biocompatibility and size, concentration, surface properties, morphologies and structures of IONPs, underlining the need of carefully engineering biocompatible NPs with in vitro study of degradation and cells availability to ensure in vivo safe metabolization [
