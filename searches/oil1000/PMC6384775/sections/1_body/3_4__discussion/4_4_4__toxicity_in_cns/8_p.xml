<p class="p">The majority of neurotoxicity studies on IONPs are performed in 2-dimensional in vitro cultures [

 <xref rid="B115-materials-12-00465" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>], extended also to other types of inorganic NPs, such as silica NPs [

For instance, brain cells can be cultured to form spheroids, which allow recreating the 3D-spatial environment of the CNS, in order to test advantageously and more precisely IONPs toxicity. In summary, the exploration of the impact of various IONPs on CNS functions and the development of new strategies to test it are a current research trend running in parallel with the study of iron homeostasis alterations involved in neurodegenerative disorders.
