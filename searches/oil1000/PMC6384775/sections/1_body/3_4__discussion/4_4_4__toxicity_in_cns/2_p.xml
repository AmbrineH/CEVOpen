<p class="p">It is well established in literature the high complexity of mechanisms that can induce cytotoxicity after NPs interaction and involve both cellular and molecular pathways. They include physical damage of membrane, structural changes in cytoskeleton components, defects of transcription and oxidative damage of DNA, damage of mitochondria, disturbance of lysosome functioning, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration of membrane protein functions, and synthesis of inflammatory factors and mediators [

Currently, several studies on their harmful effects are carried out in various in vitro and in vivo models, in order to investigate the relation between biocompatibility and NPs or MNPs features [
