<p class="p">Overall, nine hundred and fifty-one (951) papers were collected through database searching. The second step of bibliography synthesis consisted in the manual selection of a subset of the so collected papers, essentially on the basis of their abstract and their actual contents (in particular the presence of CNS-specific details about IONP behavior and their magnetic characterization). The number of works resulting from this filtering procedure was fifty-three (53). Sixty-three (63) further references were then added—as stated in Methods Section—by manually screening the bibliography of the collected publications, for a final number of one hundred and sixteen (116) entries. As a result of this last step, more than half (54%) of our reported references are prior to 2017. In particular, apart from the last two years, also the period ranging between 2012 and 2015 is highly represented in this review, having thirty-eight (38) cited works. </p>
