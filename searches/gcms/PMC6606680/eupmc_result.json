    "BACKGROUND:Many commercially important drug and flavor compounds are secondary metabolites of terpenoid origin. Pogostemon cablin, a commercially important industrial and medicinal crop, accumulates abundant patchouli oil comprised of more than 24 unique sesquiterpene compounds, with the most abundant being patchouli alcohol. RESULTS:In this study, we analyzed the P. cablin transcriptome library, obtaining 74 terpenoid biosynthesis-related genes, and identified their expression patterns in leaves, stems, and flowers. These genes are members of 15 different families, and we detected all the enzymes involved in the sesquiterpenes pathway that are responsible for patchoulol biosynthesis. Sequence structure, homology, conserved domain properties, and phylogeny of certain identified genes were systematically investigated. Color complementation assay was used to verify the functional activity of the MEP pathway proteins. Exogenous hormone treatment revealed that patchoulol synthesis is induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis indicated that the MVA pathway genes (acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, and farnesyl diphosphate synthase) participate in patchoulol biosynthesis and are mediated by MeJA. CONCLUSIONS:Taken together, this is the first report of integrated analysis of P. cablin MVA and MEP pathway related genes, providing a better understanding of terpenoid and/or patchoulol biosynthesis in P. cablin, and the basis for improving patchoulol production through genetic engineering."
