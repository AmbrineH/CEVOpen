    "Thymoquinone (TQ), a phytochemical compound found in Carum carvil seeds (C. carvil), has a lot of applications in medical especially cancer therapy. However, TQ has a hydrophobic nature, and because of that, its solubility, permeability and its bioavailability in biological mediums are poor. To diminish these drawbacks, we have designed a herbal carrier composed of Ergosterol (herbal lipid), Carum carvil extract (Carum) and nonionic surfactants for herbal cancer treatment. C. carvil was extracted and characterized by GC/Mass. Two different formulations containing TQ and Carum were encapsulated into niosomes (Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum, respectively) and their properties were compared together. Morphology, size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), profile release rate, in vitro cytotoxicity, flow cytometric, DNA fragmentation and cell migration assay of formulations were evaluated. Results show that both loaded formulations have a spherical morphology, nanometric size and negative zeta potential. EE% of TQ and Carum loaded niosomes was about 92.32% ± 2.32 and 86.25% ± 1.85, respectively. Both loaded formulations provided a controlled release compared with free TQ. MTT assay showed that loaded niosomes have more anti-cancer activity compared with Free TQ and free Carum against MCF-7 cancer cell line and these results were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Cell cycle analysis showed G2/M arrest in TQ, Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum formulations. TQ, Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum decreased the migration of MCF7 cells remarkedly. These results show that the TQ and Carum loaded niosomes are novel carriers with high efficiency for encapsulation of low soluble phytochemicals and also would be favourable systems for breast cancer treatment."
