However, TQ has a hydrophobic nature, and because of that, its solubility, permeability and its bioavailability in biological mediums are poor. To diminish these drawbacks, we have designed a herbal carrier composed of Ergosterol (herbal lipid), Carum carvil extract (Carum) and nonionic surfactants for herbal cancer treatment. C. carvil was extracted and characterized by GC/Mass. Two different formulations containing TQ and Carum were encapsulated into niosomes (Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum, respectively) and their properties were compared together. Morphology, size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), profile release rate, <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity, flow cytometric, DNA fragmentation and cell migration assay of formulations were evaluated. Results show that both loaded formulations have a spherical morphology, nanometric size and negative zeta potential. EE% of TQ and Carum loaded niosomes was about 92.32%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.32 and 86.25%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.85, respectively. Both loaded formulations provided a controlled release compared with free TQ. MTT assay showed that loaded niosomes have more anti-cancer activity compared with Free TQ and free Carum against MCF-7 cancer cell line and these results were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Cell cycle analysis showed G2/M arrest in TQ, Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum formulations. TQ, Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum decreased the migration of MCF7 cells remarkedly. These results show that the TQ and Carum loaded niosomes are novel carriers with high efficiency for encapsulation of low soluble phytochemicals and also would be favourable systems for breast cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cancer has become a global deadly disease Such a way that about 7.6 million death reported in 2008 and based on anticipation, maybe it arrive to 13.1 million death in 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Generally, cholesterol served as a helper lipid that can diminish interactions of niosomes with proteins of the immune system and increase their stability in biological fluids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

There is a good agreement size between SEM and DLS for TQ loaded niosome. A lot of authors mentioned that DLS shows hydrodynamic size of particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The hydrodynamic size measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) is defined as &#x0201c;the size of a hypothetical hard sphere that diffuses in the same fashion as that of the particle being measured&#x0201d;.

Since in Carum there are a lot of phytochemical compounds that can interact with surface of niosomes, we observed a bigger size in DLS than SEM for this formulation.

In this study, we introduced an innovative niosome delivery system with ergosterol (herbal lipid) in structure, instead of cholesterol which is usual in noisome synthesis, that encapsulated Carum and/or TQ and provided high stability, nanometric size, good encapsulation efficiency. Our findings suggest that Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum markedly inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in comparison with free TQ and/or free Carum. Flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation assay confirmed the apoptotic efficacy of these drug nanoformulated noisome systems. Furthermore, the migration of cancer cells was also suppressed in Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum formulations. This study suggests that encapsulation of low soluble phytochemicals such as TQ and Carum into niosomes can increases their effectiveness and hence can be considered as chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer. Further studies should be performed to clarify the influence of other factors such as type of intracellular pathways, cellular uptake and <italic>in vivo</italic> study to better understand the molecular mechanism of these phytochemical carriers for the further development and establishment of Nio/TQ and Nio/Carum as clinical drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par18">Sorbitane monostearate (Span 60), Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), MTT reagent, Ergosterol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and standard Thymoquinone (2-isopropyl-5-methyl-1, 4-benzoquinone) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
