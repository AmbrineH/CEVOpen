    "Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) meets with great favor due to its high efficiency, low organic solvent consumption, and the specialty for the identification of the isomeric species. This review describes the advances of SFC in targeted and untargeted lipid profiling. The advancement of the SFC instruments and the stationary phases are summarized. Typical applications of SFC to the targeted and untargeted lipid profiling are discussed in detail. Moreover, the perspectives of SFC in the lipid profiling are also proposed. As a useful and promising tool for investigating lipids in vitro and in vivo, SFC will predictably obtain further development."
