Indeed, the pathway has long been considered a potential therapeutic target to tackle the devastating and neglected tropical diseases caused by these parasites. However, plasma membrane glucose and glycerol transporters are both expressed by trypanosomes and these parasites can infiltrate tissues that contain glycerol. Here, we show that bloodstream form trypanosomes can use glycerol for gluconeogenesis and for ATP production, particularly when deprived of glucose following hexose transporter depletion. We demonstrate that <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> hexose transporters 1 and 2 (THT1 and THT2) are localized to the plasma membrane and that knockdown of THT1 expression leads to a growth defect that is more severe when THT2 is also knocked down. These data are consistent with THT1 and THT2 being the primary routes of glucose supply for the production of ATP by glycolysis. However, supplementation of the growth medium with glycerol substantially rescued the growth defect caused by THT1 and THT2 knockdown. Metabolomic analyses with heavy-isotope labelled glycerol demonstrated that trypanosomes take up glycerol and use it to synthesize intermediates of gluconeogenesis, including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and hexose 6-phosphates, which feed the pentose phosphate pathway and variant surface glycoprotein biosynthesis. We used Cas9-mediated gene knockout to demonstrate a gluconeogenesis-specific, but fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Tb927.9.8720)-independent activity, converting fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into fructose 6-phosphate. In addition, we observed increased flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the succinate shunt. Thus, contrary to prior thinking, gluconeogenesis can operate in bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>. This pathway, using glycerol as a physiological substrate, may be required in mammalian host tissues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Trypanosomes are the etiological agents of human sleeping sickness and animal African trypanosomiases, a range of diseases in cattle, other livestock and horses caused by several <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> subspecies. The mammalian stage of the parasite circulates in the bloodstream, a nutrient-rich environment with constant temperature and pH and high glucose concentration. Hence, it was unsurprising that bloodstream trypanosomes use glucose in a low-efficiency manner and produce ATP mostly from glycolysis, with simplified mitochondria and metabolism. Recently though, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> were found in abundance in adipose tissue, and also in skin, suggesting the need for flexible and more elaborate metabolic capacity. We show that trypanosomes synthesise sugars <italic>de novo</italic> from glycerol via gluconeogenesis. Depletion of glucose transporters is rescued by supplementation with glycerol. Moreover, even wild-type parasites, grown in the presence of glucose and glycerol, use both substrates and have active gluconeogenesis. Metabolome analysis also showed utilization of glycerol to feed the pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide biosynthesis and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. Trypanosomes do not accumulate storage polysaccharides, but mammalian-infective parasites do assemble a dense surface glycoprotein coat, the glycan components of which incorporate carbons from glycerol. Thus, gluconeogenesis can be used to drive intermediate metabolism and terminal metabolite biosynthesis. Our results reveal metabolic flexibility and adaptability in trypanosomes, which is likely required for survival in multiple host tissue environments. This should be considered when devising metabolically targeted therapies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100320/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5173-9284</contrib-id><name><surname>Horn</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The work was funded by Wellcome Trust (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">https://wellcome.ac.uk/</ext-link>) Investigator Awards to DH (100320/Z/12/Z) and MAJF (101842/Z13/Z), with additional support from Wellcome Trust Centre Awards to Dundee (203134/Z/16/Z) and Glasgow (104111/Z/14/Z).

The mammalian-infective form of the parasite, typically referred to as the bloodstream form (BSF), lives in blood of mammalian hosts and enters the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a fatal disease if not treated. In addition, trypanosomes were recently detected in adipose tissue in a mouse model [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and the skin of both humans [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tsetse flies transmit the parasites; these procyclic forms (PCF) grow in the insect mid-gut, differentiating through other adaptive life-cycle stages, and later migrating to the salivary glands, for transmission in saliva as metacyclic forms. Each of the parasite&#x02019;s stages is morphologically and metabolically adapted to the respective environmental conditions. Nutrient availability is variable in the tsetse mid-gut and PCF trypanosomes can utilize proline, and generate the majority of their ATP in a reticulated mitochondrion containing canonical functions; although the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle appears to operate in a non-canonical manner [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the other hand, BSF trypanosomes in the bloodstream grow in a stable, nutrient rich environment, with a constant and abundant glucose supply, producing ATP from glycolysis; the mitochondrion, the electron transport chain and the TCA cycle are substantially reduced in BSF cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The recent identification of trypanosomes in adipose tissue [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and in the skin of humans [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], indicated that the &#x02018;bloodstream forms&#x02019; should now be considered as bloodstream-resident, CNS-resident, adipose-resident or skin-resident forms, potentially with differing metabolic capacities.</p><p>Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway with the highest flux in BSF <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> grown in culture medium; this pathway has been thoroughly studied and has long been considered a promising potential drug target [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The majority of the glycolytic enzymes are localized inside glycosomes, specialized peroxisomes harboring glycolysis and additional metabolic pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The glycosome membrane is semi-permeable; hence only smaller metabolites can pass freely [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while ADP/ATP or NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH regeneration must be balanced inside the organelle. It has been proposed that compartmentalized glycolysis emerged to facilitate adaptation to different environmental conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other metabolic pathways that are compartmentalized inside glycosomes include the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), nucleotide sugar biosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis and salvage, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, probably due to their connection to glycolysis [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as glycerol, lactate or glucogenic amino acids. In principle, it is the reverse of glycolysis, as many glycolytic enzymes are reversible, the direction depending on substrate and product concentrations. Only two steps are thought to be unique to GNG in protozoa; requiring fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FbPase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PCF <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> display GNG capacity fed by proline [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but GNG was thought to be absent from BSF <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, since FbPase activity was not detected [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Metabolomic analysis with labelled glucose also failed to reveal evidence for GNG [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, it is often stated that BSF trypanosomes depend &#x02018;exclusively&#x02019; [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or &#x02018;entirely&#x02019; [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] on glycolysis, using glucose as a substrate, for ATP production (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). For this reason, the glycolytic pathway has been considered to be a promising target for antitrypanosomal drug discovery [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the other hand, Ryley [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported utilization of glycerol for respiration by both BSF and PCF <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>rhodesiense</italic> in the early 1960s. Furthermore, glycerol has been used routinely to sustain trypanosomes in glucose-free media for several hours in radiolabelling experiments [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also recently reported the use of glycerol for ATP production by BSF <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>There are thought to be five copies of each trypanosome hexose transporters gene, THT1 (Tb927.10.8440&#x02013;8480) and THT2 (Tb927.10.8490&#x02013;8530), arranged in an array in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> strain 927 reference genome, however the number of copies is variable across different strains [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The two gene types are similar, containing some identical domains. THT1 transcripts are substantially more abundant in BSF cells relative to PCF cells, while in PCF cells, THT2 transcripts are substantially more abundant than THT1 transcripts [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Specific regions in the 3&#x02019;-untranslated regions contribute to this stage-specific expression pattern [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while only THT2 transcripts are upregulated after glucose depletion [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The THTs comprise twelve trans-membrane domains and a cysteine-rich loop [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They are closely related to mammalian hexose transporters, although some substrate selectivity was observed [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Overall, the substrate selectivity of THT1 and THT2 is similar, but THT1 is a high capacity, low affinity transporter, whereas THT2 is a lower capacity, higher affinity transporter; this may reflect the conditions under which each of the proteins is expressed (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p><p>Here, we explore glycerol utilization for GNG in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> depleted of THTs, and find GNG operating even in wild-type cells that have access to glycerol. Carbons from stable isotope labelled glycerol are detected in sugar phosphates, PPP intermediates, VSG glycans and other metabolites. We also detect robust FbPase activity, even after deletion of the annotated FbPase gene. Thus, contrary to prior thinking, GNG is available to mammalian stage <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> and may operate in tissue environments where glycerol is available. This metabolic flexibility may be essential for adaptation to environmental conditions and survival in mammalian host tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>THT1 and THT2 are plasma membrane-localised and life cycle stage-regulated</title><p><italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> hexose transporter 1 (THT1) transcripts are substantially more abundant than THT2 transcripts in the bloodstream stage, whereas the situation is reversed in the insect-stage [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Both proteins are thought to be localized to the plasma membrane. To determine whether this is indeed the case, we assembled strains that express an <italic>N</italic>-terminal mNeonGreen (mNG) tagged copy of each gene type; tags were inserted at the native loci.

Since the glycosomal membrane is impermeable to large metabolites such as NAD(H), NAD/H, recycling has to be balanced within the glycosome [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Upregulation of the glycosomal succinate shunt could compensate for this deficiency through malate dehydrogenase activity and NADH dependent fumarate reductase activity. Consistent with this view, we observe similar labelling for malate, fumarate and aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007475.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), with relatively small proportions (8&#x02013;11%) of these metabolites containing <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub> label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007475.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) in wild-type <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> in the presence of glycerol, which increases under hexose-transporter knockdown and glycerol-replete conditions; approximately three-fold, and reaching 36&#x02013;47% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007475.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).

Thus, metabolism in these parasites is not as simplified and reduced as had been thought. Indeed, we demonstrate some GNG even in wild-type cells grown on glycerol, even when glucose is also available.

Indeed, our current data are consistent with a report from 1962 on trypanosomes using glycerol as a substrate for respiration [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and a report from 1977 on pyruvate production from glycerol [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

Although the same enzymatic repertoire is theoretically available in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], our findings suggest that amino acid supply in growth medium fails to fuel GNG in cultured bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>. On the other hand, glycerol may activate GNG, thereby allowing other substrates to be used.</p><p>Futile cycling between glycolysis and GNG would be energetically disadvantageous, but it is consistent with our observation that GNG is associated with a fitness cost. Depletion of triosephosphate isomerase, leading to production of one ATP per molecule of glucose, caused a severe growth defect in BSF <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similarly, one molecule of ATP is produced per molecule of glycerol when GNG is operative, while two molecules of ATP are produced per molecule of glucose in glycolysis. However, this may be compensated for by upregulating glycerol uptake. Decrease in glycolytic intermediates indicates decrease of flux in glycolysis, which may be a consequence of futile cycling. In addition, glycerol must be phosphorylated in the initial step of GNG, potentially inhibiting glycolysis by depleting the ATP required to drive the hexokinase and the phosphofructokinase reactions.</p><p>In parallel with GNG, we do see evidence for metabolic compensation to balance ATP production. Additional ATP may be produced in the mitochondrion in the acetate:succinyl-CoA shunt, the TCA cycle directly by succinyl-CoA synthetase, or indirectly by feeding the electron transport chain with reduced cofactors from the TCA cycle. Specifically, labelling patterns observed in fumarate, malate, and aspartate support activity of the TCA cycle, as proposed previously in adipose tissue trypanosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA, which then introduces two labelled carbons into the TCA cycle. An alternative explanation for this labelling pattern is that the enzymes, malate dehydrogenase and fumarase, are working in both directions and shuffling carbons, as a consequence of GNG disrupting the usual metabolic steady state. The glycerol-derived <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub> component of fumarate, malate, and aspartate; comprising about 8% in wild-type, increased three-fold following hexose transporter knockdown. This may reflect glycosomal succinate shunt activity or the reverse action of TCA cycle enzymes. Notably, increased activity of the glycosomal succinate shunt would also serve to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> and maintain NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance inside the glycosome.</p><p>Various mammalian host tissues may provide glycerol in quantities sufficient for GNG in trypanosomes. Infection in the cerebrospinal fluid is well known. However, little is known about parasite metabolism in the central nervous system and glycerol concentration is lower than in blood [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Adipose tissue contains glucose at concentrations about seven fold lower than in plasma [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and glycerol at concentrations about four fold higher than in plasma [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], although these levels may be variable. Adipose tissue form trypanosomes may possess metabolically active or upregulated pathways, which are silent in the BSF, i.e. the TCA cycle and fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and we show here that GNG is active in the presence of glycerol. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> are also present in skin, but their metabolism has yet to be scrutinised in this tissue [<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007475.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Trypanosomes may never encounter environments completely lacking glucose under physiological conditions in mammalian hosts. Notably, in this regard, GNG is operative when both glucose and glycerol are present. Incomplete labelling in our glycerol-fed metabolomics analyses suggests that, although glucose uptake was below the detection limit of our assay in the absence of hexose transporters, some glucose was likely still imported by endocytosis. An ability to use both substrates may be crucial for adaptation to particular tissue environments or during transitions between tissues.</p><p>Our metabolomics analysis indicates that, in the presence of a suitable substrate, GNG does operate in mammalian form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>.
