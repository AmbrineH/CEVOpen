    "Dittrichia viscosa (L.) Greuter, a perennial weed of the Mediterranean area, was reported to be source of active substances. Here, by means of both ingestion and contact assays, the biological activity of three different extracts (n-hexane, methanol, and distilled water) of D. viscosa aerial part has been evaluated against Sitophilus granarius (L.) adults, an important pest of stored grains. Ingestion assays showed negligible mortality and food deterrence for all the extracts, whereas only a slight reduction of some nutritional parameters (relative growth rate, relative consumption rate, food efficiency conversion) was recorded for water extract. High contact toxicity was found only for the n-hexane extract (24 h median lethal dose LD50 = 53.20 μg/adult). This extract was further subfractioned by silica gel column chromatography and then by thin layer chromatography. Further contact toxicity bioassays highlighted two active subfractions which were analyzed by GC-MS. This revealed the occurrence, in both subfractions, of two major peaks that were identified as α- and γ- costic acid isomers. Moreover, D. viscosa active subfractions, did not cause acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition; therefore, in the light of progressive limitation of compounds acting by this mechanism of action, D. viscosa represents a promising eco-sustainable source of natural products for pest control."
