The bioflocculant was produced with a bioflocculating activity of 87.8%. The hydrocarbon degradation was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and was further supported with contact angle measurements for the changes in hydrophobic nature of the culture medium. A specific aerobic degradation pathway followed by the bacterium during the bioflocculant production and hydrocarbon utilization process has been proposed. FT-IR, SEM-EDX, LC/MS, and <sup>1</sup>H NMR measurements indicated the presence of carbohydrates and proteins as the major components of the bioflocculant. The bioflocculant was characterized for its carbohydrate monomer constituents and its practical applicability was established for removing the heavy metals (Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Pb<sup>2+</sup>) from aqueous solutions at concentrations of 1&#x02013;50 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. The highest activity of the bioflocculant was observed with Ni<sup>2+</sup> with 79.29 &#x000b1; 0.12% bioflocculation efficiency.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>n</italic>-hexadecane</kwd><kwd>bioflocculant</kwd><kwd>contact angle analysis</kwd><kwd>removal of heavy metals</kwd><kwd>glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>bioremediation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001407</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">DBT(BT/228/NE/TBP/2011)</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The applicability of microorganisms for biodegradation of hazardous substances, such as xenobiotics, pesticides or even crude petroleum has been a subject of interest due to the wide range of possible uses in various bioremediation procedures and may be called as a &#x0201c;green process.&#x0201d; Attention is particularly directed toward isolating robust microbes from nature which could be employed for remediation of pollutants as chemical agents are found effective in degradation but may lead to various toxicity issues. Assessment of microbes for their remediation potential in dealing with industrial pollutants is another point of interest where a bacterium or a fungus produces metabolites as their weapon of degradation. An important area of increasing interest in this is to investigate novel metabolites or macromolecules generated by microbes during the process of metabolism. Researchers are also taking interest to selectively investigate such metabolites for their use in treatment of environmental pollutants including waste water pollutants containing heavy metals contaminants generated from various refineries, industries, and mills (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barakat, 2011</xref>). Currently the industries have up taken various strategies for removal of organic and metallic contaminants from waste water, such as sedimentation, membrane filtration, coagulation-flocculation, adsorption, chemical precipitation, and ion-exchange, etc. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aracic et al., 2015</xref>). In this respect, the remediation of industrial waste water with a large input of variety of toxic heavy metals, has received considerable attention with wide-ranging interests in &#x0201c;bioflocculation&#x0201d; procedures that utilize an active metabolite, the &#x0201c;bioflocculant&#x0201d; in the process.</p><p>The bioflocculants are environment-friendly biological macromolecules and have been tested successfully for treating wastewater. There have been several classes of bioflocculants originating either naturally or prepared with cost-effective nutrients. Bioflocculant production by microbes utilizing a variety of media like brewery wastewater, soybean juice, fishmeal wastewater, etc., has been reported in the literature (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Microbes produce various polysaccharides that are classified by their biological functions into intracellular storage polysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides (closely linked to the cell surface) and extracellular polysaccharides (such as xanthan, sphingan, alginate, cellulose, etc.). Bacteria produce a wide range of exopolysaccharides which are synthesized via different biosynthesis pathways (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jochen et al., 2015</xref>). These polysaccharides play an important role in biofilm formation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Schmid and Sieber, 2015</xref>). The extracellular polysaccharides are biodegradable in nature and are notably identified as exopolysaccharides (EPS), glycoproteins, glycolipids, etc. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lian et al., 2008</xref>). The EPS is likely to play a critical role in biosorption of metals. The extracellular metabolites excreted by bacteria and fungi or produced from cell lysis, might have some flocculation activity and might play the role of an energy source for microbes during starvation, as mediator in cell&#x02013;cell interactions, facilitating the adherence of cells to the surface. Thus, they could become instrumental in biofilm formation and in microbial aggregation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Shi-Jie et al., 2011</xref>). Recent investigations suggest that the activity of exopolysaccharides in biofilm formation may be responsible for making the bacterium comfortable to a hydrophobic substrate such as phenanthrene, a high molecular weight PAH (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mangwani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in the production of bioflocculants, the microbes can utilize unusual carbon sources as nutrient along with the production of other bacterial metabolites. It has been reported that a <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> could have efficiently utilized alkanes in biosurfactant or bioflocculant production and in the process, could have degraded to linear and branched alkanes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Sayavedra-Soto et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies show the potential of a known petroleum hydrocarbon scavenger microbe to produce bioflocculants during its metabolic process (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>). In the present work, crude petroleum (the so-called &#x0201c;sweet crude&#x0201d; from Assam oil fields, India with abundant aliphatics and PAHs in it) itself has been taken as the hydrocarbon source. An attempt has been made to observe the particular behavior of a hydrocarbon degrading microorganism that is not amended with typical mineral medium. It is thought that the study will be able to find a few answers to the chemistry behind production of bioflocculant.</p><p>Studies reported from the same laboratory have shown that the subject bacterium is capable of degrading crude oil that contains as many as 34 different petroleum hydrocarbons (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>). However, the main objective behind the present study is to understand whether the bioflocculant production by the bacterium is dependent on the complex mixture of hydrocarbons in the crude oil as a whole or was dependant on a particular hydrocarbon only for displaying bioflocculating property, or could the activity be enhanced by any of the hydrocarbons present in the crude petroleum in producing one or more of the bioflocculants. Thus, this study serves as a model in investigating some of the unanswered questions with respect to utilization of a single petroleum hydrocarbon substrate and generation of a bioflocculant to be utilized as an alternative to typical chemicals for removing heavy metals from the environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>All the chemicals, standards, and petroleum hydrocarbons were purchased from HiMedia chemicals, MERCK, and Sigma-Aldrich.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial Utilization of Hydrocarbons</title><p>A potent bioflocculant producing bacterium, capable of catabolizing the hydrocarbons in crude petroleum was selected for this work. This bacterium was identified as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain IASST201 by using 16srDNA sequencing technique and the sequence was submitted to GenBank with accession number <underline>KF583972</underline>. It exhibited bioflocculating activity highest among other bacterial isolates screened from activated sludge samples collected from Numaligarh Refinery Limited, Bongaigaon Refinery Limited and Noonmati Refinery of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Assam, India. Data published earlier from this laboratory (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>) have confirmed the presence of 34 different petroleum hydrocarbons in the tested crude oil which was to be utilized as the only carbon source by the bacterium to produce bioflocculant <italic>in vitro</italic> in an optimized production medium. In the present work, crude oil in the same optimized production medium was initially replaced with 1% mixture of 34 petroleum hydrocarbons. The initial pH of the medium was maintained at 7.2 and the same was incubated in an orbital shaker at 37 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C with a rotation speed of 150 rev min<sup>-1</sup>. For estimating bioflocculant activity, the methodology suggested by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kurane et al. (1986)</xref> was adopted. After the incubation period was complete, the bacterial culture grown supernatants were obtained by centrifuging the culture broth at an rpm of 6000 maintaining the temperature at 4&#x000b0;C. This was used as raw bioflocculant for initial evaluation. The bioflocculating activities of each isolate were determined by using the culture broth supernatant as raw bioflocculant. 0.04 g of kaolin clay was suspended in 9.45 mL distilled water, mixed thoroughly with 0.5 mL of 1% CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. 0.05 mL of the culture supernatant was then added to the suspension and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with very dilute NaOH and HCl. The mixture suspension was vortexed in a test tube for 1 min and kept for 5 min at room temperature. The bioflocculating activity was determined using the formula:</p><disp-formula id="E1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">Bioflocculating activity </mml:mtext><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mtext><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mtext><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">550</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">100</mml:mn><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><p>where, A<sub>550</sub> is the absorbance of the supernatant while A<sub>s</sub> is the absorbance of the blank without any prior treatment.

The optimum pH (5&#x02013;9) and the concentrations (0.1&#x02013;5.0%) of the hydrocarbons necessary to obtain the highest bioflocculating activity was determined as well. The growth of bacteria in the production medium amended with single hydrocarbon was verified by measuring the optical density of the bacterial broth at 600 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Production and Purification of Bioflocculant from Suitable Carbon Source</title><p>The most effective hydrocarbon source supporting growth of the bacterium was determined on the basis of highest bioflocculating activity exhibited by the bacterium during its utilization <italic>in vitro</italic>. Increase of bioflocculating activity in the culture medium was observed along with bacterial growth and the growth vs. bioflocculating activity curve was constructed. This helped in mass production of the bioflocculant under optimized parameters. The bioflocculant produced by the strain IASST201, was extracted from the production broth supernatant (6000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 30 min) by ice-cold ethanolic precipitation and then kept for 12 h to separate the bioflocculant content. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation, lyophilized and solubilized with deionized water (conc. 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) and purified with a DEAE-cellulose-52 column. The purified bioflocculant was eluted with deionized water and a grade of (0.1&#x02013;1 M) NaCl in phosphate buffer (pH 7) maintaining a flow rate of 0.5 mL per min (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the Bioflocculant</title><p>The protein concentration of the bioflocculant was measured by the Bradford method (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bradford, 1976</xref>) and the total carbohydrate content was determined with the Anthrone method (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gerhardt et al., 1994</xref>). The biochemical assays were used to determine the presence of different sugars. The Purified bioflocculant was further subjected to FTIR in ATR mode (500&#x02013;4000 cm<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p>The purified bioflocculant from the DEAE column was lyophilized and was subjected to FE-SEM. The scanning electron microscopic images were taken at 5 kV with a FE-SEM (Zeiss, P-Sigma, Germany). The EDX measurements were performed with an X-ray detector and were analyzed with INCA 4.15 EDS software (Oxford Instruments). The same was subjected to PerkinElmer thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 4000 at the heating rate 10&#x000b0;C/min and with a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min.</p><p>The protein content of the bioflocculant was separated by chloroform: butyl alcohol (5:1) extraction. The protein-free bioflocculant was dialyzed against de-ionized water overnight, vacuum-dried, followed by hydrolysis with 2N trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in a hydrolysis tube (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Neeser and Schweizer, 1984</xref>). Excessive TFA was removed, denatured protein debris were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, followed by incubation in ice for 30 min and further centrifugation (10000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C). EPS was precipitated by ethanolic precipitation and the pellets were obtained through centrifugation (10000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C). It was then reconstituted with 1 mL of acetonitrile/water (80:20 v/v) and analyzed for different structural analogs by LC/MS (1260 Infinity LC fitted with 6410 Triple Quadrupole MS, Agilent Technologies, USA). A 2 &#x003bc;L sample aliquot was injected into a ZORBAX C18 column using a gradient of water + 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) at 40&#x000b0;C maintaining a flow rate of 0.2 mL min<sup>-1</sup> with modifications (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fran&#x000e7;ois et al., 2012</xref>).

However the weight loss of the sample is constant from &#x0223c;550&#x000b0;C up to end of the run indicating the strong carbohydrate backbone of the bioflocculant.</p><p>The <sup>1</sup>H NMR analyses of the bioflocculant significantly reflected the results obtained from FTIR study.

Again, signals at 4.60&#x02013;4.62, 3.19&#x02013;3.88, and 1.23&#x02013;1.25 ppm confirmed the presence of hydroxyl proton, non-anomeric protons and CH<sub>2</sub> linkage in the sample, respectively. Again, a peak around 1.88 ppm indicated the presence of carbonyl linkage of glycoprotein chains. These results ascertained the composition of bioflocculant to be of carbohydrate and proteinous substance or as of glycoprotein polymeric-origin.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p><bold><sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of purified bioflocculant indicated presence of nonanomeric proton, -NH group, carbonyl and CH<sub>2</sub> linkages</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-08-00170-g005"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Mass Spectrometry Based Characterization of Bioflocculant EPS</title><p>Through the LC/MS based analysis, adducts of Na<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> ions were identified for the sugar monomers depending on fragmentation and elution time in present case.

The difference might be due to the state of the bioflocculant surface. It may be noted that the electronic properties of the metals and the physicochemical status of the biological material determine the metal-removal capacity. In case of the bioflocculant, active functional groups like carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups on the surface might also be an important factor (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Khakimov et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p><bold>(A&#x02013;F)</bold> showing flocculation of five heavy metals varied in concentration of 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg L<sup>-1</sup>.

Already this isolate was reported for its peculiar characteristics of utilizing crude petroleum oil for production of efficient bioflocculant by our team (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>). However, the concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in a complex nutrient source like crude oil is highly intrusive and the responsible hydrocarbon acting as the active carbon source triggering the bacteria to produce bioflocculant was not appreciated in earlier reports. It was pertinent that a deeper insight into defragmenting the conditions of hydrocarbons distributed in the crude oil composition was inevitable to understand the dependency of the bacteria for its sustenance and production of bioflocculant.</p><p>Aerobic alkane degraders often activate alkane molecules using O<sub>2</sub> as a reactant. It is also known that alkane-activating monooxygenase overcome the low reactivity of hydrocarbons by producing reactive oxygen species. In the case of methyl oxidation by some microbes, degradation is initiated by the oxidation of a terminal methyl group to a primary alcohol, then oxidized to aldehyde and finally to a fatty acid. These in turn get processed by the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-oxidation pathway. The degradation intermediates shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold> relate to the present microbial action along the aerobic degradation pathway of alkane mentioned by <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fritsche and Hofrichter (2000)</xref>. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold> shows how possibly a typical aliphatic hydrocarbon may be converted to simpler molecules through microbial actions. In this, the molecular structures were drawn for n-tridecane-1-ol, 2-hexadecanol, n-hexadecanoic acid, and 1-hexadecanol, respectively. These compounds have been detected through GC/MS analysis. The presence of these compounds indicates the degradation of <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane to simpler molecules during its utilization by the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species. An aerobic degradation pathway is suggested. The metabolic process caused by the bacterium converts the target hydrocarbon (<italic>n</italic>-hexadecane) to primary or secondary alcohol species at different cleavage points of the carbon chain, also leading to formation of aldehydes with less number of C-atoms than the target compound. Acids generated by diterminal degradation were also detected in the degradation products suggesting that that the bacteria were scavenging <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane as a carbon source and the long chain molecule was degraded step-by-step. Each and every degradation intermediates could not be detected in this work as the single solvent system may not be sufficient to elute all the different organic degradation products.</p><p>Microorganisms are well known to degrade C5&#x02013;C16 alkanes and other common constituents of the crude petroleum (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jan et al., 2003</xref>). It was found that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolated from the polluted soil of a petroleum refinery can remove high doses of phenanthrene within 30 days (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Romero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Haritash and Kaushik, 2009</xref>). The bacterium utilized in the present work is also a strain of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and has been known to degrade crude oil sufficiently (77%) in a short period when the bioflocculating activity is the highest (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>). This may be due to the optimized production medium enriched with essential nutritional elements as compared to a minimal salt medium. From the data generated in this work, it is clearly seen that the bioflocculating activity is of a lower level in case of inoculated production medium with high molecular weight carbon sources. The ability to degrade low molecular-weight aromatic compounds, such as naphthalene, is widespread, and numerous reports have identified bacteria capable of utilizing these hydrocarbons for growth (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cerniglia, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland et al., 1995</xref>). But the growth on aromatic substrates containing fused aromatic rings (e.g. chrysene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene) is somewhat rare, although organisms are known to use each of these aromatics as carbon source substrate.</p><p>The relationship between the rate of hydrocarbon degradation and the yield of bioflocculating activity is still doubtful but the results from this work definitely indicate that the bacterium, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, shows the highest flocculating activity in presence of a single aliphatic hydrocarbon rather than a complex carbon source. For degradation, the EPS like bioflocculant could not be solely responsible, but yield of other compounds, such as emulcyan or rhamnolipids may be responsible for the enhancement of degradation <italic>in vitro</italic>. The degradation percentage of <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane by the subject bacterium was found to be higher than that of crude petroleum (77%) studied earlier (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>), because it is present as a single substrate nutrient instead of a complex mixture of nutrients composed of petroleum hydrocarbons, both long chain aliphatics and polyaromatics, when the bacterium needs much more energy to converting the complex substrate to a digestible one.</p><p>Contact angle measurement of the culture broth during <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane degradation has revealed some interesting results with respect to alkane biodegradation during the production of extracellular metabolites. This has been reported for the first time and could be considered as supportive data in respect of the degradation of the substrate. CA measurement was applied as a semi-quantitative analytical tool for measuring the hydrophilic behavior of a substrate undergoing biodegradation. It was found experimentally that the CA rapidly increased as <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane degradation rate went up and these changes could be represented as a direct measure of the degradation kinetics. The measurements revealed that the alcohols and acids formed during the biodegradation of <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane in the culture medium were polar and hydrophilic due to the hydroxyl end of the molecules. At the same time, the carbon chain is nonpolar and hydrophobic. As the carbon chain extends, the molecule becomes increasingly nonpolar and less soluble in water due to corresponding increase in hydrophobicity. The increase in bioflocculant production in the medium throughout the growth period was likely to be accompanied by a natural increase in the hydrophilic substances leading to an increase in the hydrophilic nature of the whole mass. As the moisture free glass surface is hydrophobic by nature, <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane droplet has the minimum CA on it (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>).</p><p>Compositions of bioflocculants are often reported to be glycoprotein like substances where the conjugates are functional in showing flocculating activities (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015a</xref>). In the present case, FTIR spectra became indicative of the presence of functional groups related to sugars and proteins. The FTIR analysis of the bioflocculant in this work showed the presence of &#x02013;OH or &#x02013;NH groups and the broad spectra appeared to be similar to that of a sugar-protein of complex origin. &#x02013;OH, &#x02013;COOH and COO&#x02013; groups in the polymer molecules are important determinants for the flocculating activity while H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> groups on the surface of the suspended particles may form hydrogen bonds when the bioflocculant chains approach the surface of particles.</p><p>A clear picture of the composition of the bioflocculant was obtained from the SEM-EDX results. Different bacteria involved in flocculation mostly produce EPS based bioflocculants. The present bacterium had produced the bioflocculant as an extracellular metabolite which had a composition consisting of the elements (C, N, or O) in a typical glycoprotein-like substance. Reports suggest that <italic>Rhizobium</italic> sp. and <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. produce EPS mainly composed of C and O whereas a <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. produces EPS that mainly comprises of N and O (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015b</xref>). <italic>Bacillus</italic> species from marine environment had reportedly produced bioflocculant composed of C, N, O, P, and even S (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Ugbenyen et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of Na, P, or Cl in the bioflocculant was primarily due to the attachment of elution buffer chemicals at the time of column purification (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>).</p><p>Thermogravimetric analysis of the bioflocculant showed it to be composed of both partially thermolabile and thermostable molecules, a mixture of carbohydrates and proteinous substances as seen from the analysis. The first weight loss could be due to the loss of moisture content of the bioflocculant or of the protein part associated with glycoprotein-like molecules. Similar observations have been made by <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2011)</xref> with respect to a bioflocculant obtained with mixed consortia of bacteria. In case of the bioflocculant, p-KG03, produced by a bacterial species, <italic>Gyrodinium impudicum</italic> KG03 (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yokoi et al., 1995</xref>), the initial weight loss was between 40 and 230&#x000b0;C with decomposition occurring at about 310&#x000b0;C. In the present work, the second decomposition occurred at 340&#x02013;360&#x000b0;C. The stability of the bioflocculant produced by the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain was up to 550&#x000b0;C that can be termed as moderately thermostable. The typical TGA curve of glucose in nitrogen environment also states the final decomposition within the range of 400&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zhishuang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The <sup>1</sup>H NMR could be confirmatory analytical tool in such investigations which revealed the presence of hydroxyl proton, non-anomeric protons and CH<sub>2</sub> linkage in the sample, respectively. In the proton NMR, despite the fact that most resonances are often found clustered between 3.4 and 4.0 ppm, <sup>1</sup>H spectra of carbohydrates also results some well-resolved signals related to those of anomeric protons (&#x0223c;4.4&#x02013;5.5 ppm), acetyl (&#x0223c; 2.0&#x02013;2.1 ppm), and methyl (&#x0223c;1.2 ppm) groups, and other protons which are influenced by specific functionality, including NH<sub>2</sub> groups, phosphorylation, sulfation, glycosylation, and acetylation, or the lack of functionality as in deoxy-sugars (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bubb, 2003</xref>). However, possible shifts may be observed which may add plus or minus to the theoretical values due to secondary disturbances or nature of solvent utilized in analyses.</p><p>Production of EPS by bacteria is a well known phenomenon, but how EPS is involved right from signaling to utilization as building blocks in biofilm construction is yet to be fully understood. Determinable as a common entity, biofilms can be beneficial, for instance, to degrade environmental hazardous substances in the soil or in a bioreactor or as bioflocculants in the separation of particles from associated mineral matter like waste water (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bos et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover the biofilm matrix composed of EPS which also share a part in the composition of bioflocculants, often acts as an external digestion system by keeping extracellular enzymes close to biofilm cells, capable of metabolizing dissolved, colloidal and solid biopolymers. The EPS matrix constitutes the immediate environment and conditions of life for biofilm organisms and thus, is regarded as a key component for the understanding of the biofilm mode of life. Bacterial biofilms have been intensively studied not only because of their ecological importance, application in biotechnology, and waste water treatment but also due to their potential role in human infections and function as environmental reservoirs for pathogens (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Jachlewski et al., 2015</xref>). However, a detailed composition analysis of an EPS content of bioflocculant tends to be difficult due to complex mixture of biomolecules and intermediates that act as functional and non-functional accessories. Furthermore, even though carbohydrates are identified as one of the major components of EPS, the biochemical properties of them remain elusive due to their complex structures and unique monomer linkages (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Jiao et al., 2010</xref>). Characterization for determination of EPS monomers and even the associated proteins has been possible through HPLC, LCMS/MS, and LC/MS-ESI techniques (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Jachlewski et al., 2015</xref>). However, in bioflocculants the carbohydrate parts are seen profoundly present from other analyses. EPS is often implicated in the initial attachment of bacteria to surfaces and subsequent biofilm formation since it is present at the outermost layer of the cell (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). EPS has also emerged as a rich source of non-volatile sugar complexes, such as poly-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG), but that could be detected with GC/MS by proper derivatization with chemical agents like BSTFA (<italic>N</italic>,<italic>O</italic>-Bis trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide), TMSCN (Trimethylsilyl cyanide) or MSTFA(<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wozniak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Khakimov et al., 2013</xref>). Alditol acetate derivatives of exopolysaccharides also presented successful determination of sugar monomers through GC/MS (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Shi-Jie et al., 2011</xref>). In present work, GC/MS analyses of M-MSTFA derivatized bioflocculant detected EPS monomers as O-M-O-TMS derivatives. This analysis successfully identified all the sugar monomers associated with the composition of bioflocculant which were not completely understandable from the LC/MS analysis alone. This showed a preferable priority of GC/MS analysis in carbohydrate characterization upon ESI-LC/MS tool as it always forms different adducts from which the actual <italic>m/z</italic> were to be calculated without any confirmation from mass library.</p><p>Bacteria of different genera are known as bioflocculant producers and their application in heavy metal removal has received a lot of attention recently. In our study, the selectivity of the mentioned five heavy metals was based on by noticing the risking abundance of them in the samples chosen for isolation of bioflocculant producing bacteria which attained tolerance toward them as inborn nature. In a prior investigation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Subudhi et al., 2016</xref>) on heavy metal tolerant bacteria were screened for their bio-absorption of metals but the real application of bacterial cells are difficult in practical scenario, but it is easier if the effective metabolites responsible for heavy metal entrapment is used in practice and the outcome will be interesting. In the present study, the subject bioflocculant was able to flocculate the five mentioned heavy metal in a pattern of Ni<sup>2+</sup> &#x0003e; Zn<sup>2+</sup> &#x0003e; Cd<sup>2+</sup> &#x0003e; Cu<sup>2+</sup> &#x0003e; Pb<sup>2+</sup>. Initially the bioflocculant produced from <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane utilization was injected to 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> concentrations of the heavy metal amended aqueous solution, the pH of the whole content being unchanged in its optimum dose. The highest bioflocculating activity was found around pH 7 in this case. Heavy metal removal capacity of a bioflocculant in an aqueous system is reported to be lower at low and high pH values of the system; at low pH, a high concentration of protons competes for the anionic sites on the polymer preventing the removal of the divalent cations. Thus, divalent cation binding is low. This is actually the functional groups of any bioflocculant through which it acts to flocculation. Basically, the functional groups of EPS in bioflocculant are important factors determining their flocculation activity, especially when &#x0201c;bridging&#x0201d; could be considered as the most supported mechanism involved in flocculation. It is also found that the uronic acids in the bioflocculant help in the flocculation mechanism (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2005</xref>). In present case presence of glucuronic acid in the bioflocculant produced by this Pseudomonas species in confirmed through mass spectrometric analysis. Carboxyl groups present on the molecular chain of bioflocculants provide more sites for particle attachment and makes bridging between bioflocculant and discrete particles effective (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Farooq et al., 2010</xref>). As the pH increases to its optimum value, which differ from one metal ion to another, the adsorbing surface is saturated with negative charges, resulted in increased efficiency to bind and adsorb metal cations. At pH higher than the optimum value, hydroxo species of the metals can be formed that do not bind to the adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Harichund, 2011</xref>). The stability of pH obtained in the present study could be advantageous in removing other heavy metals and pollutants too from various waste water streams by bioflocculants in required doses.</p><p>Bioflocculants derived from bacterial origin are reported to be of different structural origins varied with the source bacteria (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Toeda and Kurane, 1991</xref>). In this case, in removing considerable amount of heavy metals from their aqueous solutions, the novel composition of the bioflocculant, a polymer of EPS and protein, could be instrumental. The main backbone of the EPS was composed of several sugars and proteins as the side chains which provided numerous flocculant binding sites, while the long backbone ensured the formation of large flocs (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Shi-Jie et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting the involvement of the functional groups of related with bioflocculant, it was also evident from studies on Zn sorption on different bacterial strains which stated presence of acidic, neutral and basic group on the cell surface essential for bio-sorption (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Guine&#x000e4; et al., 2006</xref>). The interactions between the exopolysaccharide based bioflocculant, and Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and other metal cations in aqueous solution leads to removal of the metal ions from water.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work, conducted with a selected microorganism, frequently designated as an opportunistic pathogen but which always bears a greater role in biosynthesis of molecules applicable for biodegradation of hydrocarbons, has revealed a few significant features with respect to the bioflocculant. Metabolites detected during substrate utilization (<italic>n</italic>-hexadecane) could be correlated with the production strategy of a novel bioflocculant, which could be described as a carbohydrate polymer capable of removing several heavy metals from water, with aerobic degradation pathway of aliphatic hydrocarbons. CA measurements have been established as a successful tool for investigating the interfacial behavior during the degradation process and subsequent exopolysaccharide-protein bioflocculant production may have immense possibilities for utilization in wastewater treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MP as Ph.D. research scholar had taken part in all laboratory scale experiments, analysis as well as writing the manuscript.
