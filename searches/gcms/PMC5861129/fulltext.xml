Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it challenging to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer. Here, we report that brewer&#x02019;s yeast can be engineered to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil. Whereas metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways is commonly enlisted to maximize product titers, tuning expression of pathway enzymes to affect target production levels of multiple commercially important metabolites without major collateral metabolic changes represents a unique challenge. By applying state-of-the-art engineering techniques and a framework to guide iterative improvement, strains are generated with target performance characteristics. Beers produced using these strains are perceived as hoppier than traditionally hopped beers by a sensory panel in a double-blind tasting.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Production of aromatic monoterpene molecules in hop flowers is affected by genetic, environmental, and processing factors.

Over the past two decades, consumers have displayed an increasing preference for beers that contain hoppy flavor. Hops are an expensive ingredient for breweries to source (total domestic sales have tripled over the past 10 years due to heightened demand) and a crop that requires a large amount of natural resources: ~100 billion L of water is required for annual irrigation of domestic hops and considerable infrastructure is required to deliver water from its source to the farm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Considerable research has investigated which of these molecules are primarily responsible for this flavor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>; these studies are complicated by genetic, environmental, and process-level variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and have suggested that the bouquet of flavor molecules contributed to beer by hops is complex. Nonetheless, the two monoterpene molecules linalool and geraniol have been identified as primary flavor determinants by several sensory analyses of hop extract aroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and finished beer taste and aroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and together, they are major drivers of the floral aroma of Cascade hops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, the most widely used hop in American craft brewing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Previous metabolic engineering efforts have achieved microbial monoterpene biosynthesis in various microbial hosts. Work in a domesticated wine yeast has demonstrated the feasibility of producing monoterpene compounds by biosynthesis in yeast by overexpression of a geraniol synthase from a high-copy plasmid propagated in selective media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

To achieve this end, we identify genes suitable for monoterpene biosynthesis in yeast; we develop methods to overcome the difficulties associated with stable integration of large constructs in industrial strains; we adapt genetic tools to generate a collection of engineered industrial yeast strains on an unprecedented scale; we develop computational methods to affect precise biosynthetic control and leverage them to create a iterative framework towards target production levels. Ultimately, sensory analysis performed with beer brewed in pilot industrial fermentations demonstrates that engineered strains confer hoppy flavor to finished beer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of yeast-active linalool and geraniol synthases</title><p id="Par6">The monoterpene synthases that catalyze the reaction of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) to linalool and geraniol in hops have not yet been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, genes from other plant species have been shown to encode these activities. To identify a linalool synthase (LIS) gene for functional heterologous expression in yeast, we expressed six different plant-derived LIS genes in a lab yeast strain engineered for high GPP precursor supply (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). However, none of the full-length proteins exhibited sufficient activity to achieve target monoterpene concentrations in finished beer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In plants, monoterpenes are biosynthesized in chloroplasts; plant monoterpene synthases, therefore, typically contain an N-terminal plastid targeting sequence (PTS) composed of 20&#x02013;80 polar amino acids, which is cleaved to produce a mature protein. Truncation of the PTS sequence can improve expression and activity of microbially expressed monoterpene synthases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, methods for&#x000a0;predicting the optimal PTS truncation site, as well as for predicting&#x000a0;portability of enzymes from plant species to yeast are imperfect. We therefore screened candidate LIS variants from different sources and with different truncation sites for increased activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We tested bioinformatically predicted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> PTS sites and observed a substantial increase in activity for the <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> LIS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We also used a heuristic, structure-based approach for PTS prediction: a conserved&#x000a0;double arginine (RR) motif that functions as part of an active-site lid preventing water access to the carbocationic reaction intermediate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> lies immediately C-terminal to the PTS in several well-characterized terpene synthases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

An analogous screen of six geraniol synthases revealed that the heterologous expression of the full-length protein from <italic>O</italic>. <italic>basilicum</italic> (<italic>Ob</italic>GES) leads to geraniol production in yeast (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Strategy for engineering monoterpene biosynthesis in brewing yeast</title><p id="Par7">Once we identified monoterpene synthases that were sufficiently active in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, we set out to engineer brewer&#x02019;s yeast strains capable of producing monoterpenes during beer fermentation. Yeast naturally produces the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) through the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, as FPP serves as a precursor for essential metabolites including hemes and sterols. While the flux through this pathway is tightly regulated, extensive metabolic engineering efforts have informed key genetic modifications that obviate regulatory checkpoints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and increase monoterpene precursor supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) is one of the key rate-limiting steps of the pathway and is controlled by an inhibitory regulatory domain that responds to product accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Overexpression of a truncated form of yeast HMGR lacking the regulatory domain (tHMGR) results in increased flux towards end products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A downstream enzyme, FPP synthase (FPPS), catalyzes the sequential condensation of two isopentyl pyrophosphate molecules with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. GPP, the immediate precursor of monoterpene biosynthesis, is formed as an intermediate of the sequential reactions. While the high processivity of the wild-type FPPS limits the intracellular availability of GPP, a mutant (FPPS*) has been identified that reduces processivity, thereby increasing production of GPP-derived end products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that modulating the expression of tHMGR, FPPS*, t67-<italic>Mc</italic>LIS, and <italic>Ob</italic>GES would result in brewer&#x02019;s yeast strains capable of producing linalool and geraniol during fermentation at concentrations encompassing those typical of finished beer (~0.2&#x02009;mg/L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">In devising a strategy to modulate pathway activity, two challenges were considered. First, de novo design and generation of a collection of multi-gene constructs is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. To circumvent this challenge, we combined an existing toolkit of yeast genetic parts with a Golden Gate assembly strategy for facile design and rapid pathway construction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Second, incorporating large (i.e., &#x0003e;10&#x02009;kb) genetically stable DNA constructs into brewer&#x02019;s yeast has not been reported, and is complicated by their ploidy as well as concerns regarding the incorporation of selection markers in food-processing agents. We therefore developed a Cas9-mediated methodology for stable and marker-less pathway integration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#x02013;c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, and Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Our method leverages a colorimetric assay to screen for positive transformants and allows for macroscopic visualization of successful integration events. Interestingly, this method also allowed us to visualize the high degree of genetic instability associated with&#x000a0;heterozygous integration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). By combining the assembly and integration strategies, we were able to generate strains with a diverse set of genetic designs, where each strain contained a unique combination of promoters driving expression of the four modulated genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Iterative improvement of strain design towards targeted monoterpene&#x000a0;production levels. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of design&#x02013;build&#x02013;test&#x02013;learn cycle. Design: Constructs were designed by combining yeast toolkit parts (i.e., promoters, terminators, linkers, etc.) with monoterpene biosynthesis pathway genes. Build: Methodology for integrating constructs into brewer&#x02019;s yeast. Note that, for simplicity, only a single allelic copy of the ADE2 locus is diagrammed. The ADE2&#x00394; strain was co-transformed with a Cas9/sgRNA plasmid and repair template, which targeted a double-stranded break (DSB) in the ADE2 3&#x02032; sequence. Test: Data were collected using LC/MS, HPLC, and GC/MS. Learn: Correlation analyses informed design principles. Mathematical models were used to evaluate the extent to which design principles improved strain search efficiency.

ADE2 encodes an enzymatic step in purine biosynthesis and its deletion results in the accumulation of a metabolite with red pigment when grown on media containing intermediate adenine concentration. Because the repair template contains the <italic>ADE2</italic> gene, templated DSB repair results in a white colony phenotype. Because brewer&#x02019;s yeasts have multiple allelic copies of ADE2, stable integration requires repair at multiple ADE2&#x00394; genomic loci. White colonies streaked from transformation plates result in either white colony color (<bold>b</bold>) or variegated colony color (<bold>c</bold>); white colony color corresponds to homozygous integration; variegated colony color corresponds to heterozygous integration, illustrating genetic instability of heterozygous allele containing a large DNA construct. <bold>d</bold> Illustration of assembly steps from parts (promoters/genes) to gene cassettes, to repair templates for first iteration strains.

To improve search efficiency towards desired monoterpene concentrations, we separated our design&#x02013;build-test process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) into two stages, thereby affording us an opportunity to first sample a small subset of design space and then hone subsequent designs towards desired production profiles. An initial set of 18 strains containing promoters predicted to span a wide range of expression strengths were constructed and grown under microaerobic fermentation conditions that mimicked an industrial brewing process (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). We found that these first iteration strains produced monoterpenes within the range of commercial concentrations, although were generally lower (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Some strains exhibited a reduced fermentation capacity (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref><bold>)</bold> including the strains closest to commercial concentrations. However, reduced fermentation capacity did not correlate with monoterpene production, suggesting that the fermentation defects were not primarily due to monoterpene toxicity (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Production of monoterpenes by engineered strains.

Furthermore, total monoterpene production was correlated with tHMGR and FPPS* abundance and linalool production was correlated with t67-<italic>Mc</italic>LIS abundance, verifying that the selected genes indeed control monoterpene production as anticipated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). An interesting anomaly was that <italic>Ob</italic>GES abundance was not correlated with geraniol production.

Together, these findings were encouraging, as they firmly demonstrated that genetic design can be used to control monoterpene production and that the knowledge gained from our initial test set could guide subsequent design.</p><p id="Par11">We next set out to generate a second iteration of designs with target production levels defined by three commercially hopped beers that span a wide range of monoterpene concentrations and perceived hop flavor/aroma intensity. The salient trends observed in the test set informed two guiding principles: (1) to shift overall monoterpene production towards higher levels, designs were composed of strong promoters driving tHMGR, FPPS*, and <italic>Ob</italic>GES and (2) to ensure variation in the ratio of linalool to geraniol, designs encompassed a range of promoter strengths driving expression of t67-<italic>Mc</italic>LIS.

We anticipated that applying these design principles towards desired performance characteristics would improve search efficiency. In order to evaluate the extent of improvement, we established a mathematical modeling-based framework to predict the relationship between genetic design and monoterpene production (Online Methods, Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, and Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

To test the consistency of yeast-biosynthesized monoterpene levels, replicate fermentations were performed at 8&#x02009;L scale with a subset of engineered strains. To test the consistency of hop-derived monoterpene levels, Cascade hop preparations originating from five different farms in the Northwestern United States were used to supplement fermentations performed with the parent strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>). We observed little variation in final monoterpene concentrations between replicate samples fermented with engineered strains, whereas fermentations hopped with different preparations yielded significantly greater variation (linalool <italic>p-</italic>value &#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, geraniol <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>; <italic>t-</italic>test) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>). This result demonstrates that engineered strains biosynthesize monoterpenes more consistently than can be achieved by randomly selecting Cascade hop preparations from different farms. Next, to test whether yeast-biosynthesized monoterpenes conferred hop flavor, beer was produced in an authentic, pilot-scale brewhouse, following a recipe for a classic American Ale, using three engineered strains and the parent strain (<italic>WLP001</italic>) as a control (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>). A panel of tasters determined that the finished beers exhibited a range of hop flavor/aroma intensity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). In addition, the apparent difference in hop flavor/aroma intensity between beer fermented with JBEI-16652 and JBEI-16669 was considerable, despite only a ~twofold difference in linalool and geraniol concentrations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that monoterpenes derived from yeast biosynthesis during fermentation give rise to hop flavor/aroma in finished beer and that biosynthesis provides greater consistency than traditional hopping. Finally, in order to compare the intensity of hop flavor conferred by traditional dry hopping with the hop flavor conferred by engineered strains, fermentations were performed both with the parent strain with dry-hop additions as well as with JBEI-16652 without dry-hop additions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>).

In contrast, beer produced with JBEI-16652 again exhibited significantly higher hop flavor/aroma than the&#x000a0;parental control.

We developed new methods to overcome the difficulties associated with stable integration of large constructs in industrial strains. Unlike classical microbial metabolic engineering efforts that focus on maximizing the titer of a single molecule, we focused on tuning the expression of key genes in a biosynthetic pathway&#x000a0;to simultaneously make precise concentrations of multiple flavor molecules. This application promises to generate hop flavors with more consistency than traditional hop additions, as hop preparations are notoriously variable in the content of their essential oil and the flavor they impart to beer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. It should be noted that blending hop preparations from different sources can be used to reduce variation. However, blending is ultimately limited by practical constraints: In the best case, large craft breweries create one single hop blend per year, which fails to mitigate year-to-year variation. Our strategy is favored over plant or microbial bioprocess extraction because it avoids the use of non-renewable chemicals typical of industrial extraction. While historic consumer trepidation towards genetically engineered foods is of concern for widespread adoption, the general increase in consumer acceptance of such foods when tied to increased sustainability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> is encouraging.</p><p id="Par14">Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of engineering brewer&#x02019;s yeast by incorporation of heterologous genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>; however, the scope and commercial relevance of these efforts have been limited, in part due to methodological difficulties of incorporating an array of large, genetically stable DNA constructs into industrial yeasts. Recent studies have resorted to alternative methods such as breeding hybrid strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. While this has proven to be a powerful approach for generating diverse aroma phenotypes, it is intrinsically limited to enzymes and aromas associated with native yeast metabolism. Here, we developed a complementary methodology that allows for stable incorporation of plant secondary metabolism genes into industrial brewer&#x02019;s yeast. We provide evidence that incorporating linalool and geraniol biosynthesis confers hop flavor to beer. We note that the full flavor imparted by traditional hopping is likely to rely on a more diverse bouquet of molecules. The methodologies described herein provide a foundation for generating more complex yeast-derived hop flavors, and broaden the possibilities of yeast-biosynthesized flavor molecules to those throughout the plant kingdom.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cloning</title><p id="Par15">All strains, expression plasmids, and additional plasmids used for strain construction are listed and described in Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>.
