    "It has been well established that the cerebellum and its associated circuitry constitute the essential neuronal system for both delay and trace classical eyeblink conditioning (DEC and TEC). However, whether the cerebellum is sufficient to independently modulate the DEC, and TEC with a shorter trace interval remained controversial. Here, we used direct optogenetic stimulation of mossy fibers in the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) as a conditioned stimulus (CS) replacement for the peripheral CS (eg, a tone CS or a light CS) paired with a periorbital shock unconditioned stimulus (US) to examine the ability of the cerebellum to learn the DEC and the TEC with various trace intervals. Moreover, neural inputs to the pontine nucleus (PN) were pharmacological blocked to limit the associative motor learning inside the cerebellum. We show that all rats quickly acquired the DEC, indicating that direct optogenetic stimulation of mossy fibers in the left MCP is a very effective and sufficient CS to establish DEC and to limit the motor learning process inside the cerebellum. However, only five out of seven rats acquired the TEC with a 150-ms trace interval, three out of nine rats acquired the TEC with a 350-ms trace interval, and none of the rats acquired the TEC with a 500-ms trace interval. Moreover, pharmacological blocking glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs to the PN from the extra-cerebellar and cerebellar regions has no significant effect on the DEC and TEC learning with the optogenetic CS. These results indicate that the cerebellum has the ability to independently support both the simple DEC, and the TEC with a trace interval of 150 or 350 ms, but not the TEC with a trace interval of 500 ms. The present results are of great importance in our understanding of the mechanisms and ability of the cerebellum in associative motor learning and memory."
