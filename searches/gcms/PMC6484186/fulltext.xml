It was estimated that 46.8 million people worldwide were afflicted with dementia in 2015 and this number almost doubles every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050 due to global population aging (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Prince et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Hippocampus, especially the CA1 region, is one of the most important brain structures that play a critical role in spatial learning and memory (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>) and also is the major part of the brain affected by AD (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Fellgiebel &#x00026; Yakushev, 2011</xref>). The disease is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFT), senile plaques in extracellular space, and neuronal loss (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Parihar &#x00026; Hemnani, 2004</xref>). The most significant component of senile plaques is an insoluble fragment of Amyloid &#x003b2; protein (A&#x003b2;) formed by misprocessing of an Amyloid Precursor Peptide (APP). Direct injection of pre-aggregated A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 fragment is a non-transgenic in vivo model of AD, which is extensively used to study the molecular, morphological, and behavioral aspects of the disease (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Zussy et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The precise underlying mechanism(s) of A&#x003b2;-induced neuronal cell death in AD is still unclear. Several reports suggest that a bunch of factors accelerate the rate of progression of AD, with oxidative stress as one of the most prominent culprits (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>). Neural growth factors such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Nagahara et al., 2009</xref>), acetylcholine neurotransmitter and Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe, Casamenti, Giovannelli, Scali, &#x00026; Pepeu, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Postu et al., 2017</xref>) are also important determinants.</p><p>Two classes of medications are currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage AD, including the AchE Inhibitors (AchEIs) such as tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine as well as the noncompetitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, memantine (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bassil &#x00026; Grossberg, 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, long-term use of these drugs are costly and have considerable side effects. Moreover, duration of their efficacy is limited and above all, a definitive cure could not be achieved (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Forsyth, Surmon, Morgan, &#x00026; Wilcock, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Muller, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Cacabelos, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Mimica &#x00026; Presecki, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Much effort is now focused on finding herbs especially with antioxidant and AChE inhibitory properties that may have a promising effect in prevention or postpone of AD development. Zataria Multiflora Boiss. (ZM) is a thyme-like plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family that grows wildly only in Central and Southern Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hosseinzadeh, Ramezani, &#x00026; Salmani, 2000</xref>). Z. multiflora is not only a popular food condiment, but also famous for its diverse beneficial health effects, including antinociceptive, antimicrobial, spasmolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sajed, Sahebkar, &#x00026; Iranshahi, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Phytochemical analysis of ZM has revealed that the main constituents of the dry plant are carvacrol (61.3%) and thymol (25.1%) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Saleem, Nazli, Afza, Sami, &#x00026; Ali, 2004</xref>). Both of these compounds have AchE inhibitory properties (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Jukic, Politeo, Maksimovic, Milos, &#x00026; Milos, 2007</xref>). Majlesi et al. reported amelioration of A&#x003b2;-induced cognitive deficits in rats by ZM essential oil using Morris Water Maze (MWM) test without strictly examining the possible mechanism(s) of the observed effect (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Majlesi, Choopani, Kamalinejad, &#x00026; Azizi, 2012</xref>). Along with the confirmation of the protective effect of ZM essential oil, the current study aimed at exploring some possible mechanisms of this effect by considering antioxidant, AChE inhibitory activity, as well as its effect on the BDNF content of hippocampus in rats with the A&#x003b2;-induced AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><label>2.1.</label><title>Phytochemical analysis of ZM essential oil</title><p>Hydro-distilled essential oil of ZM leaves was purchased from Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Co., Iran.

Briefly, the procedure was accomplished by Varian 3400-Varian Saturn II GC/MS system, Canada. A DB-5 column (30 m&#x000d7;0.25 mm&#x000d7;0.25 &#x003bc;m film thickness) was used with an inlet pressure of 240 kPa. The column temperature was set to 60&#x02013;250&#x000b0;C with 3&#x000b0;C increases per minute. Injector port temperature was 260&#x000b0;C and carrier gas was helium with the linear velocity of 31.5 cm/s. Mass range was 40&#x02013;340 U.

After a week of adaptation, they were randomly allocated into four equal groups (n=10 in each) and treated as follows: 1. The Negative Control (NC) group that did not receive any treatment during the experiment; 2. Sham control (sham) group that received distilled water by Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection into lateral ventricles and vehicle (5% tween 80, Merck, Germany) by oral gavage for 20 consecutive days; 3. The AD control (AD) group that received A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) by ICV injection; and 4. The treatment (ZMEO) group that received A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 by ICV injection and on the next day, ZM essential oil at 100 &#x003bc;L/kg/d of pure essential oil in the vehicle by oral gavages for 20 consecutive days.</p><p>The dosage of ZM essential oil was according to a previous study protocol (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Majlesi et al., 2012</xref>). It should be mentioned that in a pilot study, ZM essential oil was administered by Intraperitoneal (IP) injection, which resulted in inflammatory reactions at the injection site that adversely affected the performance outcome of animals in MWM task. Therefore, the oral garaging route for the original study was selected. Procedures adopted in the present study were in accordance with institutional ethical guidelines for use of animals in experiments that were compatible with European convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3.</label><title>Induction of animal model of AD</title><p>A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 was dissolved in sterile distilled water at a concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L.

Light microscopic observation demonstrated the precipitation of insoluble globular aggregates (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ramin, Azizi, Motamedi, Haghparast, &#x00026; Khodagholi, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Rats were anesthetized by IP injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) (Alfasan, Netherland) and xylazine (8 mg/kg) (Alfasan, Netherland) cocktail. Then, they were placed in a stereotaxic instrument (Stoleting, USA) with the incisor bar set 3.5 mm below the inter-aural line. Skull was drilled and stainless-steel cannula (23-gauge) were implanted bilaterally into lateral ventricle (AP=&#x02212;0.5, LR=1.5 mm, D=4 mm) (Paxinos &#x00026; Watson, 2010). Tetracycline 3% was used on the skull immediately after surgery. The cannula was secured with stainless steel glass screws and dental acrylic cement.</p><p>One week after surgery, 2 &#x003bc;L of aggregated A&#x003b2;1&#x02013;42 (10 &#x003bc;g) or vehicle (distilled water) was bilaterally infused into the lateral ventricle through a gauge cannula connected via polyethylene tubing to a 5-&#x003bc;L Hamilton microsyringe.

The rat was allowed a maximum of 90 seconds to jump on the escape platform. The animals were then allowed to spend 15 seconds on the platform and 120 seconds in the home cage before the commencement of the next trial. During these days, the platform, placed in the center of the Southeast (SE) quadrant, was elevated 1.5 cm above the surface of the water and a gray flag was put on the platform. The platform position remained stable over three days and acquisition of this task was assessed. Each animal participated in four trials per day for three consecutive days. A different starting position was used for each trial performed on the same day and the sequence of starting positions was changed from day to day.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5.</label><title>Reference memory acquisition</title><p>On day 4, each animal was tested for reference memory using the submerged invisible platform with a visual cue placed in a fixed position (SE). Each animal participated in four trials per day for three consecutive days using a procedure similar to that used for the training task.</p><p>On day 7, a probe test was performed, in which the platform was removed and the animals were allowed to search for it for 60 seconds.

An appreciable spatial memory impairment was observed after 20 days following ICV injection of A&#x003b2;1&#x02013;42 (10 &#x003bc;g in 2 &#x003bc;L) into lateral ventricles of the rat&#x02019;s brain as shown by results of the probe tests. The validity of this model was also supported by Congo red staining, revealing amyloid deposition in the hippocampus of the AD rats.</p><p>As previously stated, Majlesi et al. for the first time described ameliorative effects of ZM essential oil on A&#x003b2;-induced cognitive deficits in rats using MWM test without examining the possible underlying mechanisms (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Majlesi et al., 2012</xref>). The current study clearly confirmed this report where a relative decrease was observed in amyloid deposits in the ZMEO group as compared with the AD group and a better outcome of the rats treated with ZM essential oil, in MWM test. Moreover, the present study demonstrated that ZM essential oil treatment partially restores spatial memory function through its ability to reduce hippocampal AchE activity accompanied by restoration of BDNF content to normal levels.</p><p>Regarding the swimming speed, which is used as a principle for locomotor activity, the present study results were consistent with the previous studies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ramin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Majlesi et al., 2012</xref>). It was shown that learning impairments in the MWM test were independent of locomotor effects, because land-based locomotor deteriorations do not affect swimming speed. Moreover, when the experimental animals have deficits during probe trials, this further dissociates learning from performance, because measures recorded on probe trials are insensitive to swimming speed (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fitzgerald &#x00026; Dokla, 1989</xref>). In the assessment of reference spatial memory, there was no significant difference in escape latency and traveled distances among groups. These findings suggest that reference spatial memory was not impaired by A&#x003b2; injection in the lateral ventricles and are in accordance with the report by Gholamipour-Badie et al.</p><p>It was well established that A&#x003b2; injection into rat brain impairs learning as a result of a hypofunction of the hippocampal cholinergic system caused by a reduction in acetylcholine release mechanisms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 1994</xref>). In a closely related recent study, Postu et al. observed a significant increase in hippocampal AchE activity of rats after about three weeks of ICV injection of A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42, which is in close agreement with the current study findings in the AD group. The results obtained from GC/MS analysis in the present study were consistent with previous research findings (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Saleem et al., 2004</xref>). Carvacrol and thymol both show the AchEI effect; the activity of carvacrol is more than thymol (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Jukic et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the mainstay of current pharmacotherapy for the AD (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lieo, Greenberg, &#x00026; Growdon, 2006</xref>). Since current therapeutic strategy in the AD was to restore cholinergic function through inhibition of AchE and thereby facilitating cholinergic neurotransmission, it is likely that AchEI activity of carvacrol and thymol, as the most important constituents of ZM essential oil, are contributed to its beneficial effects. Thus, the protective effect of ZM essential oil on spatial memory function may be related to its ability to counteract the harmful changes in levels of critical cholinergic neurotransmitter-induced by A&#x003b2; peptide.</p><p>In the present study, A&#x003b2; could reduce BDNF level in the hippocampus. The effect of A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 on hippocampal levels of BDNF was controversial and might be related to the site of A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 injection and or time of post-injection sampling. For instance, in Christensen et al. study, rats injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus with A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 showed a decrease in BDNF of frontal cortex without a significant change in hippocampal levels as compared with control rats after about 80 days post-injection (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Christensen, Marcussen, W&#x000f6;rtwein, Knudsen, &#x00026; Aznar, 2008</xref>). On the contrary, Postu et al. reported a significant decrease in hippocampal mRNA copy numbers of BDNF after about three weeks of ICV injection of A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Postu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies provide support for neurotrophic factors as promising drug targets of the AD by proving that BDNF can prevent the death of injured adult neurons in the hippocampal formation, cortex, and basal forebrain (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Murer, Yan, &#x00026; Raisman-Vozari, 2001</xref>). According to this view, decreased levels of BDNF could contribute to the neurite atrophy and synaptic loss observed in the brains of patients with AD (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Nagahara et al., 2009</xref>). Levels of BDNF could be enhanced by dietary manipulations such as calorie restriction or consumption of antioxidant diet (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fahnestock et al., 2012</xref>). It was observed in the present study that hippocampal BDNF levels of rats treated with ZM essential oil were appreciably higher than those of the AD group. Therefore, enhancement of BDNF content may play a role in the better outcome of rats treated with ZM essential oil in performing MWM task.</p><p>Oxidative stress plays an important role in the development and progression of the AD (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Reddy, 2006</xref>). A&#x003b2; interacts directly with the mitochondria and induces production of free radicals, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Reddy, 2006</xref>). Thus, antioxidants may have a protective effect against learning and memory deficits induced by A&#x003b2;. However, the results of A&#x003b2; oxidative effects are contradictory in various studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cetin &#x00026; Dincer, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Miranda, de Bruin, Vale, &#x00026; Viana, 2000</xref>).</p><p>One of the plausible reasons is that only one selective antioxidant may change during the AD; for example, it is reported that vitamin E is the most common antioxidant changes in the AD. In the present study, no appreciable change was found in the hippocampal antioxidant status of rats in the AD and ZM essential oil did not show a positive effect on MDA or TAC levels, suggesting that the beneficial effect of ZM essential oil on learning and memory does not depend on its antioxidant capacity.</p><p>In conclusion, it seems that the protective effect of orally administered ZM essential oil on learning and memory impairment due to ICV injection of A&#x003b2; 1&#x02013;42 in rats, as shown by MWM task outcome and Congo red staining, is at least partly via reducing hippocampal AchE activity accompanied by enhancement of BDNF levels without a change in antioxidant status.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><sec><title>Compliance with ethical guidelines</title><p>Procedures adopted in the present study were in accordance with institutional ethical guidelines for use of animals in experiments that were compatible with European convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. F.
