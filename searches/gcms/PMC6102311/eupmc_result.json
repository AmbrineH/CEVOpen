    "Seven cDNA clones encoding terpene synthases (TPSs), their structures closely related to each other, were isolated from the flower of Camellia hiemalis ('Kantsubaki'). Their putative TPS proteins were phylogenetically positioned in a sole clade with the TPSs of other Camellia species. The obtained Tps genes, one of which was designated ChTps1 (ChTps1a), were introduced into mevalonate-pathway-engineered Escherichia coli, which carried the genes for utilizing acetoacetate as a substrate, and cultured in a medium including lithium acetoacetate. Volatile products generated in the E. coli cells transformed with ChTps1 were purified from the cell suspension culture, and analyzed by NMR. Consequently, the predominant product with ChTPS1 was identified as valerianol, indicating that the ChTps1 gene codes for valerianol synthase. This is the first report on a gene that can mediate the synthesis of valerianol. We next synthesized a Tps ortholog encoding ChTPS1variant R477H (named CsiTPS8), whose sequence had been isolated from a tea tree (Camellia sinensis), carried out similar culture experiment with the E. coli transformant including CsiTps8, and consequently found valerianol production equally. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis of several teas revealed that valerianol had been an unknown ingredient in green tea and black tea."
