Volatile terpenoids are the active metabolites in the essential oil of <italic>Fructus Amomi</italic>. Nevertheless, downstream genes responsible for activating metabolites biosynthesis in <italic>A. villosum</italic> still remain unclear. Here, we report the use of an integrative volatile terpenoid profiling and transcriptomics analysis for mining the corresponding genes involved in volatile terpenoid biosynthesis. Ten terpene synthase (TPS) genes were discovered, and two of them were cloned and functionally characterized. AvTPS1 (AvPS: pinene synthase) catalyzed GPP to form &#x003b1;-pinene and &#x003b2;-pinene; AvTPS3 (AvBPPS: bornyl diphosphate synthase) produced bornyl diphosphate as major product and the other three monoterpenoids as minor products. Metabolite accumulation and gene expression pattern combined with AvPS biochemical characterization suggested that AvPS might play a role in biotic defense. On the other hand, the most active ingredient, bornyl acetate, was highly accumulated in seeds and was consistent with the high expression of AvBPPS, which further indicated that AvBPPS is responsible for the biosynthesis of bornyl acetate, the final metabolite of bornyl diphosphate in <italic>A. villosum.</italic> This study can be used to improve the quality of <italic>A. villosum</italic> through metabolic engineering, and for the sustainable production of bornyl acetate in heterologous hosts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Amomum villosum</italic></kwd><kwd>volatile terpenoids</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>bornyl diphosphate synthase</kwd><kwd>pinene synthase</kwd><kwd>bornyl acetate</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Amomum villosum</italic> is a plant of the ginger family which is grown in Southeast Asia and especially in southern China. <italic>A. villosum</italic> is also a Chinese traditional medicinal herb, cultivated for its fruits, which contain highly aromatic seeds (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>). The dried fruit, including seeds, is also known as <italic>Fructus Amomi</italic> (Chinese medicine name: Sharen), which has been used to treat digestive diseases such as abdominal pain, vomiting and dysentery (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chinese Materia Medica, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pharmacopoeia, 2015</xref>). In addition, <italic>Fructus Amomi</italic> has been approved by China Food and Drug Administration and due to its aroma and flavor characteristics, it has been widely used in Chinese cuisine for preparation of food, liquors, and tea.</p><p>The desired characteristics of <italic>Fructus Amomi</italic> in medicine and cuisine are mainly attributed to its essential oil, in which three potentially bioactive components were identified: bornyl acetate, borneol, and camphor (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). Its most active ingredient, bornyl acetate, has been reported to reduce 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Bornyl acetate is the quality standard of <italic>Fructus Amomi</italic> according to the Chinese Pharmacopeia (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pharmacopoeia, 2015</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that bornyl acetate had antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiabortion and anticancer activities (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Li and Wang, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Terpenoids represent the largest and most diverse class of natural products among the myriad compounds produced by plants (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tholl, 2015</xref>). Plant terpenoids are used extensively for their aromatic qualities and have a role in traditional herbal remedies. In plants, there are two metabolic pathways that produce terpenoids: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytoplasm: and the 2-C-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-erythritol-4- phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastid (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tholl, 2015</xref>). The upstream steps of these two pathways have been well understood. IPP and DMAPP are the intermediates which produce the monoterpenoid precursor geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and sesquiterpenoid precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) in these pathways (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis pathway <bold>(A)</bold> and the structures of the monoterpenes in <italic>A. villosum</italic>

These synthases convert the acyclic prenyl diphosphates into a multitude of cyclic and acyclic forms. Moreover, terpene diversity arises from the ability of these catalysts to form multiple products from a single substrate (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to the main product, nearly half of all characterized monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases form significant amounts of additional products (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>A. villosum</italic>, the bioactive components bornyl acetate, borneol, and camphor belong to monoterpenes. To our knowledge, TPSs responsible for their biosynthesis <italic>in A. villosum</italic> remain unknown.</p><p>In recent years, integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics has been developed to explore the biosynthesis pathway of the active ingredients, such as artemisinin, tanshinone, and salidroside in medicinal plants (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Torrens-Spence et al., 2018</xref>). Over the recent years, dried fruit has been used for the metabolic profiling of <italic>A. villosum</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Little is known about the metabolic profiling of fresh tissues (e.g., roots, stems, leaves, seeds, and pericarp) of <italic>A. villosum</italic> growing in its native habitat, Yangchun. This city has been well known for producing genuine and high quality <italic>Fructus Amomi</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2016</xref>). It has been reported that the contents of essential oil and bornyl acetate change with fruit development (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Xu, 2007</xref>). In the present study, fruit from two stages, 45 DAF (days after flowering) and 75 DAF, were used for comprehensive metabolomics and transcriptomics to elucidate the complexity of monoterpene and sesquiterpene (essential oil), and to further explore the genes involved in their biosynthesis. Fifteen monoterpenes (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>) were observed by metabolomics of seven fresh tissues of <italic>A. villosum.</italic> In addition, our data revealed higher concentrations of bornyl acetate, borneol, and camphor in nearly mature fruit (75 DAF) seeds compared to young fruit (45 DAF) seeds. The bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomics mined 10 TPS candidate genes (<italic>AvTPS1-AvTPS10</italic>) including five monoterpene synthase genes, three sesquiterpene synthase genes, and two diterpene synthase genes.</p><p>Two monoterpene synthase genes with full coding sequences were further cloned and characterized. AvTPS1 catalyzed GPP to produce &#x003b1;-pinene and &#x003b2;-pinene, while AvTPS3 produced bornyl diphosphate as major product, and camphene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, and limonene as minor products. Furthermore, AvTPS3 was highly expressed in the seeds collected at both stages, which was consistent with the accumulation of bornyl acetate, and which suggested that AvTPS3 has an important role in bornyl acetate biosynthesis in <italic>A. villosum</italic>. This study provides a good reference for engineering sustainable production of bornyl diphosphate and the resultant bornyl acetate in heterologous hosts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials</title><p><italic>A. villosum</italic> was planted in Yangchun, Guangdong Province, China.

Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and the resulting supernatants were pipetted into new 2 mL tubes. One milliliter of hexane extract was pipetted into 1.5 mL vials for GC-MS analysis. The extraction was analyzed using Agilent 7890B Gas Chromatograph with 5977A inert Mass Selective Detector (Agilent, United States). Helium was used as the carrier gas (1 mL/min), and then separated on the HP-5MS column (30 m &#x000d7; 250 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 0.25 &#x003bc;m film thickness). GC oven temperature was programmed at an initial temperature of 35&#x000b0;C for 5 min with an increase of 12&#x000b0;C/min to 300&#x000b0;C. Temperature was then kept at 300&#x000b0;C for 5 min. NIST14/Wiley275 Mass Spectral Library was used for metabolite identification. The terpene compounds were identified by the mass spectral library.

Interestingly, &#x003b1;-pinene existed in every tissue whereas &#x003b2;-pinene was not found in seeds (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref></bold>). Thus, we hypostasized that other pinene synthase(s) might be responsible for the &#x003b1;-pinene biosynthesis in the seeds of <italic>A. villosum</italic>. The ratios of &#x003b2;-pinene to &#x003b1;-pinene in leaves (1.78) and in pericarp of both stages (1.56 in PYF and 1.54 in PF, respectively) were similar to the ratio of &#x003b2;-pinene to &#x003b1;-pinene in the <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assay of AvPS (1.73). Nonetheless, among the seven tissues, both &#x003b1;-pinene and &#x003b2;-pinene contents were highest in the leaves, along with a lower expression of AvPS (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref></bold>). There might be other TPS that also produce pinene in the leaves of <italic>A. villosum</italic>.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9</label><caption><p>Expression levels of <italic>AvPS</italic> and <italic>AvBPPS</italic> and relative monoterpenes in different tissues of <italic>A. villosum</italic>. <bold>(A,B)</bold> The relative expression level of <italic>AvPS</italic>

Interestingly, the expression levels in SYF were approximately 400 times higher than that in leaves (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref></bold>). Moreover, the transcript levels in SYF were approximately 20 times higher compared to SF (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref></bold>). Borneol is the direct precursor of camphor and bornyl acetate (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adam and Croteau, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Despinasse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hurd et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, in order to further explore the metabolite accumulation related with AvBPPS expression, the contents of borneol, camphor, and bornyl acetate were analyzed as well as the contents of camphene, limonene, and &#x003b2;-myrcene in different tissues. The results show that the higher expression levels of AvBPPS in SYF and SF were in accord with the higher accumulation levels of camphene, limonene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, borneol, camphor, and bornyl acetate (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D,E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, bornyl acetate was much more abundant among the six monoterpene compounds (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref></bold>). The higher transcript levels of <italic>AvBPPS</italic> were positive with the higher accumulation levels of camphene, limonene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, borneol, and borneol&#x02019;s direct products camphor and bornyl acetate in seeds, which was consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme function of AvBPPS.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Metabolomics is usually referred to as &#x0201c;comprehensive metabolite profiling&#x0201d; and is usually used to identify potential bioactive plant metabolites (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>A. villosum</italic>, terpenoid profiling of roots, creeping stems, leaves and two stages of pericarp and seeds were performed to depict the scenario of metabolites among the different tissues and developmental stages. In total, 24 terpenes, including 15 monoterpenes and 9 sesquiterpenes, were found to reveal a tissue specificity trend. This data suggests that the active ingredient production in <italic>A. villosum</italic> is associated with the tissue and its development. Metabolite-related genes were mined through analyzing a combination of metabolomics and transcriptomics data. Ten TPSs genes were screened out; based on the correlation analysis and the integrity of ORF, <italic>AvTPS1</italic> and <italic>AvTPS3</italic> were further selected for cloning and their biochemical functions were investigated. AvTPS1 (AvPS) produced &#x003b1;-pinene and &#x003b2;-pinene, while AvTPS3 (AvBPPS) formed bornyl diphosphate (major product) and camphene, limonene, &#x003b2;-myrcene (minor products). Since bornyl diphosphate is also the precursor of borneol, camphor and bornyl acetate, AvTPS3 (AvBPPS) is responsible for the six main monoterpenes, bornyl acetate, camphor, camphene, borneol, limonene, and &#x003b2;-myrcene in seeds of <italic>A. villosum</italic>. AvPS and AvBPPS were observed to be localized in plastid, which was consistent with their role in monoterpene biosynthesis. The direct and subsequent products of AvPS and AvBPPS and their downstream pathway were shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>.</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>FIGURE 10</label><caption><p>The direct and subsequent products of AvPS and AvBPPS and their downstream pathway.

Moreover, monoterpenes were more prominent than sesquiterpenes, with monoterpenes accounting for over 76.59 % in pericarp and 93.39 % in seeds of the total terpenoids detected in our samples (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>). Higher monoterpene content in fruit (compared to sesquiterpene) was already reported by previous few studies (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, in these studies, dried fruit was used for terpene analysis. In contrast, we used fresh samples to depict the real temporal metabolome in <italic>A. villosum</italic>. Our results indicated that the seeds are the main accumulation organ of monoterpene, especially bornyl acetate. There were slight differences between our results and previous reports, where the intact dried fruit was used for measurement (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In our experiment, fruit was divided to pericarp and seeds. Bornyl acetate, borneol, and camphor, the three potentially bioactive components which showed high occurrences in both developmental stages of seeds, were not detected in the pericarp, indicating that these monoterpenes are mainly biosynthesized in the seeds of <italic>A. villosum</italic>.</p><p>In our monoterpene profiling, &#x003b1;-pinene was widely distributed throughout almost the whole plant, i.e. roots, creeping stems, leaves, pericarp, and seeds. Interestingly, &#x003b2;-pinene was found in all the tissues, except seeds. Pinene is a naturally occurring constituent of the essential oils in many plant species that has a relevant role in insect repellency and allelopathy (inhibiting root growth of the tested weed species) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bohlmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">McKay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hassanpouraghdam, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chowhan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Pajaro-Castro et al., 2017</xref>). AvPS (AvTPS1) catalyzed GPP to form &#x003b1;-pinene and &#x003b2;-pinene, producing 63% &#x003b2;-pinene as a major product. Combined with the fact that AvPS was highly expressed in pericarp, the exterior tissue protecting the fruits against biotic stress, we supposed that AvPS might be the gene involved in biotic defense in <italic>A. villosum</italic>.</p><p><italic>AvPS</italic> (<italic>AvTPS1</italic>) was not responsible for pinene biosynthesis in the seeds of <italic>A. villosum</italic>: no expression of this gene was detected in the seeds, and the expression of <italic>AvPS</italic> was not in accordance with the accumulation pattern of pinene in the leaves; therefore, it was speculated that other pinene synthases were present and were responsible for the pinene biosynthesis of the seeds and leaves, or that other TPSs could produce pinene as one of their multi-products in <italic>A. villosum</italic>. In this study, ten candidate genes were screened. Among them, <italic>AvTPS1</italic> to <italic>AvTPS5</italic> were classified into subfamilies that have mono-TPS function. <italic>AvTPS1</italic> and <italic>AvTPS3</italic> were cloned and characterized first since they had complete ORF in the transcriptome data. Nevertheless, whether <italic>AvTPS2</italic> and <italic>AvTPS5</italic> are involved in pinene biosynthesis needs to be further investigated. The TPS family size in angiosperm plant ranges from approximately 40 to 150 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Falara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Keilwagen et al., 2017</xref>). The TPS members in <italic>A. villosum</italic> should be considerably more than 10 as well. Considering this, besides these 10 candidate TPS genes, other TPS genes in <italic>A. villosum</italic> are likely to be discovered by further research.</p><p>Bornyl acetate was also found in other plant species, including liverwort (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adam and Croteau, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ab Ghani et al., 2016</xref>), Korean fir and <italic>Larix decidua</italic> (Pinaceae family) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jeong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Sabina chinensis</italic> (Cupressaceae family) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Lippia sidoides</italic> (Verbenaceae family) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">de Morais et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Artemisia montana</italic>, and <italic>Chrysanthemum indicum</italic> (Asteraceae family) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Stoianova-Ivanova et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kunihiro et al., 2017</xref>). Bornyl acetate was distributed in the leaves of most of the plants mentioned above, but was especially rich in the seeds of <italic>A. villosum</italic>. AvBPPS (AvTPS3) catalyzed GPP to form camphene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, and limonene, and produced bornyl diphosphate as a major product, which is the direct precursor of borneol. It is thought that borneol is converted to camphor by dehydrogenation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Despinasse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hurd et al., 2017</xref>), and to bornyl acetate by acetyl transferation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Adam and Croteau, 1998</xref>). Our correlation analysis indicated that <italic>AvBPPS</italic> (<italic>AvTPS3</italic>) was positively correlated with bornyl acetate, borneol, camphor, camphene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, and limonene (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S3</xref>). Combined with its high expression in seeds, which is consistent with the high content of bornyl acetate, AvBPPS is the key enzyme involved in the bornyl acetate biosynthesis in <italic>A. villosum</italic>. Until now, only three <italic>BPPSs</italic> have been cloned from <italic>Lippia dulcis</italic>, <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, and <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wise et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Despinasse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hurd et al., 2017</xref>). Alignment of AvBPPS with these three BPPSs showed the relatively lower identity (40% with LdBPPS, 42% with LaBPPS and 41% with SoBPPS). Nevertheless, their mono-TPS domains (RRX<sub>8</sub>W, RXR, DDXXD and NSE/DTE) were highly conserved (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S6</xref>). All four <italic>BPPSs</italic> were clustered into the TPS-b subfamily similarly with the previous report (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Despinasse et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>AvBPPS</italic> (<italic>AvTPS3</italic>) rooted the TPS-b clade (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>), suggesting that <italic>AvBPPS</italic> might retain more ancestral features than the other three <italic>BPPSs</italic>.</p><p>The biosynthesis of bornyl diphosphate, the direct precursor of borneol and bornyl acetate, is the key step for future metabolic engineering and plant breeding. In <italic>A. villosum</italic>, the upstream enzymes HMGR (MVA pathway), DXR and DXS (MEP pathway) in terpenoid biosynthesis have been cloned and characterized (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Combinational expression of AvBPPS with upstream genes can increase bornyl diphosphate production. An understanding of the gene-terpene network and the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the bioactive components is important for improving the quality of <italic>A. villosum</italic> through metabolic engineering and breeding. The future discovery of the downstream enzymes after AvBPPS, such as dehydrogenase catalyzing bornyl diphosphate to form borneol and acyltransferase catalyzing borneol to form bornyl acetate, could illuminate the complete biosynthesis pathway of bornyl acetate which then could be utilized to synthesize bornyl acetate in heterologous hosts.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>JY, DM, and HW designed the experiments.
