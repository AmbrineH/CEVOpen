    "Secondary metabolites play a vital role in the treatment of various ailments as well as in phytoremediation. The link between secondary metabolites and phytoremediation needs exploration. Hitherto, no information is available regarding the phytochemical components that exist in the root exudates of Cyperus alternifolius. This study was designed to determine the phytocomponents in the root exudates of C. alternifolius under heavy metal stress. C. alternifolius was grown by a novel technique in partial hydroponic conditions and imperiled to a mixture of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, and Fe) at different concentrations. The root exudates were collected, freeze-dried, redissolved and reconstituted in hexane and analyzed in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using JEOL GCMATE II in SAIF IIT-Madras. The analysis revealed that the profile of phytochemicals in root exudates is diverse with biological properties. Few phytochemicals found in the root exudates are not cited earlier in any literature. The composition and percentage of phytochemicals could not be correlated to heavy metal concentration. Phytochemical composition decreased with an increase in heavy metal concentration. Control plant released more phytochemicals than the plants under heavy metal stress. From the results, it is evident that root exudates of C. alternifolius contain various bioactive components. Further research can be extended to evaluate the pharmaceutical importance of the species and explore its role in phytoremediation of heavy metals.The control and test plants are grown under partial hydroponic condition. Test plants are subjected to heavy metal stress, root exudates were collected from control and test plants, freeze dried, constituted in hexane and subjected to GC-MS analysis. Abbreviations Used: GC-MS: Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry."
