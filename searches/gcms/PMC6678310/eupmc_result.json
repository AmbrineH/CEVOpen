    "The worldwide regulatory demand for the elimination of non-phthalate compounds for poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) plasticization has intensified the search for alternatives. Concomitantly, sustainability concerns have highlighted sugar-based 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid as one key renewable-chemical for the development of several products, namely di(2-ethylhexyl) 2,5-furandicarboxylate (DEHF) plasticizer. This study addresses the use of DEHF under a realistic scenario of the co-existence of both DEHF and entirely fossil-based plasticizers. More precisely, original PVC blends using mixtures of non-toxic DEHF and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate ester (DEHT) were designed. The detailed structural, thermal, and mechanical characterization of these materials showed that they all have a set of interesting properties that are compatible with those of commercial DEHT, namely a low glass transition (19.2-23.8 °C) and enhanced elongation at break (up to 330%). Importantly, migration tests under different daily situations, such as for example exudation from food/beverages packages and medical blood bags, reveal very low weight loss percentages. For example, in both distilled water and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, weight loss does not exceed ca. 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Viability tests show, for the first time, that up to 500 μM of DEHF, a promising cytotoxic profile is observed, as well as for DEHT. Overall, this study demonstrates that the combination of DEHF and DEHT plasticizers result in a noticeable plasticized PVC with an increased green content with promising cytotoxic results."
