    "Introduction:The current study aimed at evaluating the effects of Zataria Multiflora (ZM) on learning and memory of adult male offspring rats with prenatal lead-exposure. Methods:Pregnant rats in the case group received tap water containing 0.2% lead acetate throughout the gestation period. Control rats had free access to lead-free tap water. Two male offspring (two-month-old, weighing 180-200 g) from each mother were randomly selected and treated with either Z. Multiflora (50, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/Intraperitoneally (I.P)/20 day) or saline. Spatial memory of the control, saline, and ZM-treated rats was evaluated by a training trial and probe test using Morris water maze (6-8 rat/group). Results:The obtained results showed memory deficits including increased escape latency, and a greater traveled distance, as well as decrements in the frequency of crossings into target quadrants in prenatally lead-exposed male offspring compared with the controls. ZM treatment (200 mg/kg/i.p) ameliorated the memory deficits in male offspring by increasing the time spent and traveled distance in the trigger zone (P<0.01 vs. saline).There was no significant difference in swimming speed between the groups. Conclusion:The results showed memory deficits in prenatally lead-exposed male offspring. ZM treatment (especially 200 mg/kg) had beneficial effects on cognitive behavior and was indicated as the improvement of lead-induced memory deficits in prenatally lead-exposed male rats. The exact mechanism(s) is not determined yet, but it could be mediated through the anticholinesterase and antioxidant effects and also alterations in Central Nervous System (CNS) and neurotransmission in the central nervous system."
