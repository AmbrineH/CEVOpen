    "Liver fibrosis is caused by liver injury induced by a number of chronic liver diseases, including schistosome infection, hepatitis infection, metabolic disease, alcoholism and cholestasis. The tissue damage occurring after injury or inflammation of the liver is a reversible lesion; however, liver fibrosis has become a worldwide problem and poses a threat to human health. The development of an effective drug for the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis is ongoing and uses information from different occurrences of liver fibrosis. In the present study, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced metabonomic changes in serum and urine at 12 weeks were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to investigate potential biomarkers. Liver fibrosis was induced in rats by subcutaneous injections of CCl4 twice a week for 12 consecutive weeks. Histopathological changes were used to assess the successful production of a CCl4-induced liver fibrosis model. Serum and urine samples from the two groups were collected at 12 weeks. The metabolic profile changes were analyzed by GC/MS alongside principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures. Metabolic profile studies indicated that the clustering of the two groups could be separated and seven metabolites in serum and five metabolites in urine were identified. In serum, the metabolites identified included isoleucine, L-malic acid, α-copper, carnitine, hippuric acid, glutaric acid and glucose. In urine 2-hydroxy butyric acid, isoleucine, N-acetyl-β-alanine, cytidine and corticoid were identified. The present study demonstrated that the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis may be associated with the dysfunction of a number of metabolic pathways, including glucose, amino acid, P450, fatty acid, nucleic acid, water-electrolyte and glutathione biosynthesis. Assessing potential biomarkers may therefore provide novel targets and theories for the innovation of novel drugs to prevent and cure liver fibrosis."
