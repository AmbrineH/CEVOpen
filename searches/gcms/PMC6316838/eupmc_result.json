    "In China, Rosa rugosa is cultivated as a source of natural perfumes. Rose essential oil is known as \"liquid gold\", given its high economic and health value. 2-phenylethanol accounts for more than 10% of the total mass fraction of the essential oil derived from R. rugosa. The regulatory mechanisms underlying 2-phenylethanol metabolism in R. rugosa, however, remain unclear. In this study, RrAAAT and RrPPDC1, two genes related to 2-phenylethanol synthesis, were cloned from R. rugosa. Expression analysis revealed that RrAAAT and RrPPDC1 were highly expressed in rose flowers in the full opening and withering stages, and in calyxes. The overexpression vectors of RrAADC, RrAAAT, and RrPPDC1 were established and transformed into Petunia hybrida via Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Results demonstrated that the overexpression of RrAADC and RrAAAT increased the 2-phenylethanol content of transgenic petunia flowers. The results of this study provide a basis for the introduction of genes related to 2-phenylethanol synthesis into roses to increase the 2-phenylethanol content of rose essential oil."
