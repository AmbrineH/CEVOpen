More and more people from all over the world have recognized and accepted TCM formulas due to their remarkable efficacies and less adverse reactions. Herb pairs, mixture of two herbs, as the basic and the simplest composition units of Chinese herbal formulas, have special clinical significance without altering their basic therapeutic features in TCM.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] So herb pairs were interested by many research workers and the composition, pharmacological effects, pharmacokinetics of herb pairs were widely studied in recent years.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Danggui-Zhiqiao herb-pair (DZHP) is comprised of <italic>Radix Angelica sinensis</italic> and <italic>Fructus Aurantii</italic> (named as Danggui and Zhiqiao in Chinese, respectively). <italic>Angelica sinensis</italic> has been widely used to treat female menstrual disorders <italic>via</italic> nourishing the blood and activating blood circulation in TCM.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] <italic>Fructus Aurantii</italic> is one of well known traditional herbal medicines to treat cardiovascular symptoms in China.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] DZHP exists in many famous Chinese herbal formulas, such as Wu Ji san, Xuefu-Zhuyu decoction, Shujin Huoxue decoction, Gexia Zhuyu decoction, Danggui-Zhiqiao decoction, which are all used to promote blood circulation, remove blood stasis, and relieve pain for long history.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Clinically, pain is one of the characteristics of blood stasis.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Essential oil is the DZHP's active ingredient. For example, Z-ligustilide, presented in the essential oil of <italic>Angelica sinensis</italic>, can inhibit platelet aggregation, resist oxidation, reduce ischemic brain injury, and blood pressure, and so on,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] d-Limonene, an active component of essential oil of <italic>Fructus Aurantii</italic>, has been reported possessing anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, lipid-lowering, and decreasing blood pressure activities.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Previous studies mostly have been focused separately on the essential oil from <italic>Angelica sinensis</italic> or <italic>Fructus Aurantii</italic>,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] respectively. So far, to the best of our knowledge, none of the study on the composition and pharmacological effects of essential oil from DZHP has been reported.</p><p>Therefore, this article aimed to analyze the composition of the essential oil from DZHP and evaluate its analgesic activity and effect on promoting blood circulation. The analgesic activity was determined by two mice experimental models: acetic acid-induced writhing response test[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and hot-plate latent pain response test.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The effect on activating blood circulation was evaluated by determining hemorheological parameters in rats with blood stasis syndrome.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Our result might provide scientific information to further understand the main components of the essential oil from DZHP, as well as its mechanism in relieving pain and activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis.

Compared with the control group, the model group had conspicuous plasma viscosity, WBRI at high and low shear rate, WBRV at high shear rate, and ERI, which indicated that the blood stasis model was built successfully. After administration, these hemorheological parameters significantly decreased in aspirin group and essential oil group compared with the model group. Obviously, the essential oil from DZHP can activate blood circulation to remove blood stasis.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Effect of essential oil from Danggui-Zhiqiao herb-pair on the hemorheology in rats with acute blood stasis syndrome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PM-12-271-g006"/></table-wrap><p>Hemorheology is the study on the relation of blood flow to pressure, flow volume, and resistance of blood vessels.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Once blood stasis develops, hemorheology and microcirculation will be further affected. It will lead to the elevation of blood viscosity, deterioration of erythrocyte deformability, acceleration of erythrocyte aggregation, and platelet aggregation, as well as microcirculatory dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The hemorheological parameters will display abnormal when blood stasis occurs. In our study, hemorheological indexes were determined to evaluate whether the essential oil of DZHP had the effect on promoting blood circulation. The results demonstrated that the essential oil of DZHP could significantly decrease hemorheological parameters including plasma viscosity, WBRI, WBRV, and ERI compared with the model group and had strong effect on activating blood circulation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The composition of the essential oil of DZHP and its analgesic, promoting blood circulation activity are reported for the first time. The essential oil of DZHP was analyzed successfully by GC/MS, and D-limonene (49.28%), Z-ligustilide (16.08%), and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-terpinen (9.53%) were rich in the oil. It had good analgesic and promoting blood circulation activities, which may give evidences contributing to explain clinical application of essential oil of DZHP on blood stasis syndrome and provide foundation for clarifying the nature of the effect in the further study.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>ABOUT AUTHOR</title><fig id="F4" position="float"><caption><p>LI Shun-Xiang</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PM-12-271-g007"/></fig><p><bold>Prof. LI Shun-Xiang</bold>, is a Professor at School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, and Director of Hunan Province Engineering Research Center of Bioactive Substance Discovery of Chinese Medicine, China.
