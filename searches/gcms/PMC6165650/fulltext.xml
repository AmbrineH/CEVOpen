The enumeration of National cancer institute, USA, reports that there are more than 100 types of cancer and all cancers, however, fall into one of four broad categories such as Carcinoma, Leukemia, Sarcoma and Lymphoma. Carcinoma is developed from epithelial cells and this is the single largest group of human cancers forming about 80 percent of all cancers. Likewise, sarcomas are tumors developing in the connective tissue cells (mesenchymal tissue) such as fibroblasts or bone cells. Cancers of blood forming cells are called leukemia. Sometimes cancer produced from the lymphoid origin is localized in lymph glands called lymphomas (Liu et al., 2015).</p><p>Cervical cancer is a current malicious disease in women and the current reason of death (Wright et al., 2005; Colager et al., 2015) in women population. Developing countries are the victims for this disease when compared to advancing countries (DeVita and Chu, 2008). Cervical cancer is a heterogenous disease, since the causative agent is the genetic and environmental factors which level to the precocious clustering of epigenetic molecules in malignant cells (Walsh and King, 2007; Jemal et al., 2005). Various expression genes like CD44, E &#x02013;cadherin KAI1, NH23, NME 1 are identified through various natural resources which are involved in the metastasis of malignant cells (Jemal et al., 2005).</p><p>Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the causative agent for cervical cancer and is the third common cancer diagnosticated in women (Zeng et al., 2014). There are about 200 types of HPV isolates prevalent in different zones in the world and it is reported that only 14 strains (16,18,31,45,33,35,39,51,52,56,58,66,68,70) accomplished the development of tumor in humans (Burd et al., 2003). The HPV oncoproteins are not the only factor that contributes to the progression of carcinoma but it enhances the response of cancer cells to estrogen (Megan et al., 2017). There are not many targeted therapies for treating cervical cancer. Hence development of effectual remedy is in demand today. It is reported that many plant derived chemicals are said to have anti-cancerous activity. These compounds strengthen the apoptotic property of the cells and control the division of the cell. Such phytochemicals are abundant in herbs and spices (Berrington and Lall, 2012), which are used in different cuisines of the world.</p><p>Clove (Syzygium aromaticum) is a flower bud used as a spice, for enriching the flavor of various foods. The flavor and aroma of the clove is due to the presence of eugenol (70-85%), an essential oil. The other two major compounds in the clove extract are Eugenyl acetate (15%) and &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (5-12%). It is proclaimed that eugenol is used as analgesics in dental treatment and is also combined with zinc oxide to be used as dental fillings (Sonalker and Nitave, 2014). They reveal anti-microbial against manyfoods borne pathogens (Singh et al., 2016). Additionally, it also exhibits strong anti-fungal property against Candida aspergillus and dermophyte species (Singh et al., 2016). Anti-oxidant property of eugenol is reported earlier with in vitro and in vivo studies (Nagababu et al., 2010). The current study pertains to the evaluation of cytotoxicity assay of eugenol against cervical carcinoma (HeLa cell lines) and in the furtherance of a fortune medication to relieve women from this battle for survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Extraction of eugenol fromSyzygiumaromaticum</title><p>Volatile components in clove were extracted using hydro distillation technique (Naveed et al., 2013). Steam distillate was prepared with 10 mg of powered clove using 80 ml of distilled water, and the volume was maintained by adding 20 ml of distilled water at equal intervals to prevent the deterioration of sample properties. The collected distillate was then subjected to liquid &#x02013; liquid extraction by adding 15ml of dichloromethane and the final solute was dehydrated using anhydrous sodium sulphate (Rana et al., 2011). The residual solvent was evaporated by rotary evaporator in vacuum at 40&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Identification and Purification of Bioactive compound</title></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Phytochemical analysis of syzygium aromaticum extracts</title><p>The phytoconstituents present in DCM extract were determined quantitatively by HPTLC.

The extract was analyzed through GC-MS, where three compounds showed large area with strong peaks. Out of three, eugenol was immaculated using HPLC for further resolution.</p><p>This investigation clearly illustrates the existence of eugenol in DCM extract of <italic>S. aromaticum</italic>, which was affirmed by GC-MS analysis of biological sample and the structure of the compounds are also predicted by FTIR technique. GC-MS is regarded as the robust technology to anticipate the existence of discrete compounds in the plant extract. Whereas, further studies similar to this gives a clear cut view of omnipresence of eugenol in wide range of essential oil constituents. A common spice that involve eugenol was cinnamon bark which contain many additional compounds in spite of eugenol (Adinew, 2014). There are other several methods to validate the existence of eugenol, however this study involves hydro distillation process to cull clove oil from the provided sample (Athar et al., 2013). The diversity in the ring structures of the chemical groups were evaluated in this study and also methyl eugenol was seen in disparate (Raymond et al., 2017). The biosynthesis of these bioactive compounds and also their systematization in sub cellular level was visualized in wide categories of plant species. Since these compounds are found to have a broad range of applications in various fields dawn from ointments to drugs that can cure chronic diseases (Kaul et al., 2008). From the above results it is commenced that retention time of eugenol was found to be 11.657 mins whereas methyl eugenol was 16.77 mins.</p><p>Initially, the extract was analyzed through High Performance liquid chromatography to resolve the different peaks. The dichloromethane extract was used to determine the existence of eugenol by comparing various traits of the sample with the standard. However, the ethanolic extract of clove cater the retention time of about 20.4 mins in analogy with the standard chromatogram (Tsai et al., 2017). Analyzing the sample through HPLC, UV detectors play a vital role for attaining the desired peak, which can be observed at 280 nm. Of all the process of dealing with the crude extracts, HPLC was viewed as the convenient choice for examining the natural derived products. The versatile nature of HPLC accord the well-presented chromatogram for secondary metabolites in the plants. Hence, it affords distinct applications in isolation and quantification of the bioactive components from various sources in the nature. Addition to that, reverse-phase column contributes for the enhanced separation and detection of components from the wide range of mixtures due to its selectivity and robustness (Boligon and Athayde, 2014).</p><p>The procured cytotoxicity results provide a clear cut view of effect of eugenol on cancer cell lines. Analysis of this study illustrates that eugenol can act as effective agent contrary to cancer cell line such as HeLa than other chemotherapeutic agent commercially available in the market. Eugenol not only showed its actions in HeLa cells but also in other cell lines likes lung cancer and breast cancer. Globally, cancer is advertised as the deadly disease from which numerous people lost their lives by diverse type of cancer originating from distinct parts of their body. Accordingly, numerous research is enduring for better evolvement of medicines treating against cancer (Greenwell and Rahman, 2015). Eugenol is said to have a defense action by which the compound knocks off the expression levels of phosphate-Akt and MMP-2 in lung cancer cells (Fangjun and Zhijia, 2018). In breast cancer cell lines like MCF-7, MDA-MB 231 and 4 T1, the extract of Annona muricata exhibited better anti-cancer activity (Levitsky and Dembitsky, 2015; Faruq et al., 2016) Many naturally available compounds from plants are proclaimed to contain anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Plant derived compounds are reported to enhance the availability of drug in the intestines, which is used to forbid the surge of cancer cells (Liu et al., 2014). Some of the pigments in plants act as natural prevention against cancer and raise their drug ability to the site of cancer. The various anti-tumour phyto pigments are Apigenin, Curcumin, Cyanidins, Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), Fisetin, Gingerol etc (Wang et al., 2012). Eugenol loaded nano emulsions induces apoptosis therefore both cell cycle and apoptosis was resolved by flow cytometry. Liver cells (HB8065) and Colon cells (HTB37) promotes greater apoptosis percentage when its treated with eugenol and canola oil solution. Morphology of treated cell lines can be visualized using converted fluorescent microscopy by staining with Hochest33258 (Majeed et al., 2014). Down regulation of E2F1 by intrinsic pathway of apoptosis which was regarded as the main killing effect of tumours. Existence of eugenol in the medium enhance the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 protein which would arrest the uncontrolled growth of breast cancer (Sharif et al., 2013). Effect of eugenol in breast cancer cells depends on the range of concentrations which was found to promote the cell death and also relay on dosage and time of exposure (Vidhya and Devraj, 2011).</p><p>Urtica membranacea shows improved activity than other plant extracts (Solowey et al., 2014). One of the research study shows that the activity of prostate cancer cell exhibits suppression when treated with Leea indica leaf extracts on different cell lines like DU-145 and PC-3. The cytotoxicity effects of methanol and ethanol extracts possess selective cause in prostate cell lines (Ghagane et al., 2017). Omnipresence of eugenol acts contrary to colon cancer cells by endorsing apoptosis in HCT-15 and HCT-29. This can be determined by measuring MMP and different order of ROS generation in cancer cells after certain limit of treatment (Jaganathan et al., 2011). Our study mainly focuses on vivacity of naturally existing drug named eugenolcontrary on HeLa cell line, which could enhance the apoptosis of abnormal cells in the body. A plant species called Ficus tend to cytotoxic human carcinoma cells especially HeLa cells. The study on this plant reveals that the extract of this plant promotes cytotoxicity even at low concentrations of about 2&#x000b5;g/ml (Khodarami et al., 2011). A comparative study was done with Papaver alkaloids on normal (Vero) and cancerous cell line (Artun et al., 2016) and it served as a effective drug against Helacells. Bryonia aspera extract promotes better cytotoxicity and apoptogenic mechanism against HeLa and HN-5 cell lines (Demirgan et al., 2016). The morphological changes in these cell lines occur due to inhibitory actions which was observed by light microscope (Pourgonabadi et al., 2017). Methanol extract of Pseudocedrela kotschyi exhibits better action towards HeLa, MCF-7, and RD cell lines. The obtained results are compared with the commercially available drugs such as vinblastine and methotrexate and is suggested that extracted sample exhibit better action than the already existing drugs (Elufioye et al., 2017). Non-pathogenic bacteria which significantly involve in fermentation process belongs to Lactobacillus species and is regarded as the effective contrary to cancer. One among those species named Lactobacillus Casei which is used as a starter culture for fermented products can be developed into efficient drug to treat cervical cancer. Foods enriched with such products are essential for women to fight against this deadly defect, caused by the psychotic changes in the life style (Kim et al., 2015).</p><p>Combination of myricetin and methyl eugenol also boost the anticancer activity, cell cycle arrest and it also promotes action of cis-platin on other hand which induces apoptosis of cervical cancer cells (Yi et al., 2015). Expression of Caspase and BID activity on HeLa cells were seen after treating cells with Kaempferia parviflora extract to examine the phosphorylation status of various genes such as ERK1/2, Elk1, AKT, and PI3K. The expression levels observed through these genes showed the enhanced level of apoptotic protein which was detected using effective chemiluminescence reagent such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and then the bands were evaluated using the particular software (Potikanond et al., 2017). The anti-tumor property of Kelussia odoratissima and Silene viscidula extractswere seen and investigated through MTT assay. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry and sinocrassulosides VI/VII from Silene viscidula were evaluated contrary to human colorectal cancer cell lines SW620 and HT-29, the human gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901 and BGC823, the human lung cancer cell line A549, the human glioblastoma cancer cell line U87MG, the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa. Therefore, their inhibitory effects promoted by compounds which was observed through MTT assay (Hosseini et al., 2017). Our results for the first time demonstrate that the Eugenol is directly capable of inducing apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, not through immune system. Our results further show that this apoptotic process might be mediated through up-regulation of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), PARP is cleaved by caspase-3 early during apoptosis in many different cell lines. The cleavage of PARP between Asp214 and Gly215 results in the separation of the two zinc-finger DNA-binding motifs in the NH2-terminal region of the enzyme from the automodification and catalytic domains, thus preventing the recruitment of the catalytic domain to sites of DNA damage (Berger, 1985). This cleavage of PARP has been suggested to occur in order to prevent depletion of energy (NAD and ATP) that is thought to be required for later stages of apoptosis. PARP cleavage serves to prevent futile repair of DNA strand breaks during the apoptotic program. a member of Bcl2 family. The proapoptotic Bax protein led to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from the mitochondria. The released Cyt c then interacts with specific adapter, such as Apaf1, which in turn proteolytically converts procaspases to active caspases. One key step of this cascade in HeLa cells was activation of caspase7, which cleaves several substrates including the PARP, a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair and maintenance of genome integrity and posttranslational ribosylation of proteins, whereby apoptosis occurs. The inactive caspase3 precursor was cleaved to the 20 kD subunit forming the active protease during apoptosis (Germain et al., 1999). This occurred in conjunction with cleavage of 116 kD PARP to 85kD proteolytic fragments. Results suggest that caspase3 may be the main effector caspase in caspase3 deficient MCF7 cells during apoptosis (Hu et al., 2001).</p><p>From this investigation, it is concluded that the activity of bioactive compounds showing a contrary effect against HeLa cancer cell lines was observed. The MTT assay was carried out with eugenol against cervical cancer cell lines and it illustrate the cell viability with respect to the natural drug and provide us a better IC50 value for contrary to cancer cell line. After incubation of treated cells with distinct concentrations of the desired phytocompound for 24 hrs, it was observed for apoptosis of HeLa cells through fluorescence microscopy by staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide. This provides us a clear view in the increased rate of apoptosis compared to other commercially available drugs (Liu et al., 2001).</p><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Financial and competing interest&#x02019;s disclosure</title><p>This research is a part of B.Tech Project work of second, third and fourth authors.
