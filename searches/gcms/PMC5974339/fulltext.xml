Its specific odour is, however, mostly unresolved to date. Accordingly, we investigated Scots pine wood samples grown in Germany for their main odorant composition. We employed dedicated odorant analysis techniques such as gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) and successfully detected 44 odour-active compounds; of these, 39 substances were successfully identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O) and two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (2D-GC-MS/O). Among the main odorants found were (<italic>E,E</italic>)-nona-2,4-dienal, vanillin, phenylacetic acid, 3-phenylpropanoic acid, &#x003b4;-octalactone and &#x003b1;-pinene, all of them having been detected with high flavour dilution factors during GC-O analyses. The majority of the identified odorants were fatty acid degradation products, plus some terpenoic substances and odorous substances resulting from the degradation of lignin. Although some of the detected substances have previously been reported as constituents of wood, 11 substances are reported here for the first time as odour-active compounds in wood, amongst them heptanoic acid, &#x003b3;-octalactone, &#x003b4;-nonalactone and (<italic>E,Z,Z</italic>)-trideca-2,4,7-trienal.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With over 100 different species widely distributed all over the world, the pine tree (<italic>Pinus</italic>) represents the largest genus of the conifers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The undemanding requirements with regard to temperature, light conditions and soil quality allow the pine to grow in many parts of the world. Accordingly, the geographical distribution of the pine tree ranges from North America, Europe and Asia to a few south-east Asian countries, and even extends to some tropical regions. The fast and straight growth of their trunks makes the pine an ideal tree for wood production and its subsequent processing. The wood&#x02019;s specific properties with respect to elasticity and strength as well as its decorative appearance predetermine its usage as a building material or for the fabrication of furniture and commodities. In German forests <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. is one of the most common trees and a popular material for the manufacture of wood products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Due to its natural appearance and specific odour, pine wood products such as toys are often preferred by consumers to those made from synthetic materials; the pine tree smell is commonly referred to as being natural, pleasant and harmonizing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, wood odour is often associated with a positive impact on health. Essential oil from various pinaceaous trees has been demonstrated to exert relaxing effects: the inhalation of the essential oil of <italic>Abies sibirica</italic>, for example, reduced the level of arousal in people after performing a video display terminal work task, and helped the participants recover from mental fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The authors concluded that the essential oil may prevent mental health problems such as sleep disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Such observations are further supported by animal studies where the essential oil of <italic>Abies sachalinensis</italic> has been shown to have an anxiolytic effect on mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, investigations in rats revealed the ability of plant-derived odours, such as &#x003b1;-pinene, to calm stress-induced hyperthermia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Additionally, it was shown that taking in the atmosphere of forest (Shinrin-yoku) impacts cerebral activity and salivary cortisol measurements. Based on these observations, the authors stated that these physiological effects are related to relaxation of the human body and spirit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Despite such reports on potential positive physiological effects of wood odour on humans, there is still a dearth of information about the underlying odorous constituents. Previous studies mainly focused on the general identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in wood, wood products or the respective essential oils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For example, Weissbecker <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> reported volatile substances in the headspace of pine wood (<italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.) with the aim of detecting substances that are recognized by insects. Thus, stimuli were identified by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-MS/EAD), meaning that the insect antennas were utilized for the targeted detection of the compounds. The authors showed that insect antennae detection mainly yielded terpenoids, aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, especially hexanal and &#x003b1;-pinene. Similar results were obtained by U&#x000e7;ar <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> using an untargeted approach, employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in their study of volatiles from <italic>Pinus nigra</italic> Arnold. They identified general volatile compounds in wood, but none of these were specifically tested with regard to their odour activity and contribution to the overall wood odour profile.</p><p id="Par5">Studies on wood odorants are few in number, and have primarily focused on the identification of odorants in wood of potential relevance for the production of alcoholic beverages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These studies predominantly focused on toasted woods, whereas natural wood odour has been largely overlooked in scientific studies. To remedy this, we recently identified the main odorants in incense cedar wood which is commonly used for everyday products such as pencils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The potent contributors to this type of wood smell were previously unknown and were identified in our study using sophisticated odorant analysis techniques. To extend our research on wood odorants, the current study aimed to elucidate the smell of pine wood by analysing the odour-active substances in three <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. samples. As in our previous study, a targeted approach was adopted, combining state-of-the-art odorant analysis methods with human-sensory evaluation of the odorous compounds. The most potent odorants were rated via aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) according to Grosch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and identified by one- and two-dimensional high resolution gas chromatography-olfactometry/mass spectrometry. The findings are an important step towards a better understanding of compounds that generate typical wood smells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Odour profiles and sensory evaluation</title><p id="Par6">In a first step, 30 untrained panellists were asked to rate the pleasantness and intensity of the pine wood. Since these sensory tests were performed to give a preliminary overview on the pine wood odour, only wood splints of one of the <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. samples were presented to the panellists. On a 10&#x02009;cm visual analogue scale from 0 (no perception) to 10 (very intense) the pine wood was scored with a high intensity of 7.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6 and a slightly positive hedonic rating of 6.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.7 on a scale from 0 (very unpleasant) to 10 (very pleasant). In order to acquire a detailed odour profile (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) of the sample, a panel of extensively trained and tested persons was asked to select odour attributes in consensus for the description of the odour impressions of the samples. The attributes chosen were <italic>carpenter&#x02019;s shop-like/sawdust-like, pencil-like, fatty/cardboard-like, herb-like, fresh-cut cucumber-like, cheesy/sweaty, rubber-like/plastic-like/waxy, wood glue-like, peppery, frankincense-like, citrusy</italic> and <italic>resin-like</italic>. In a second evaluation, the intensity of each attribute was rated on a 10&#x02009;cm visual analogue scale from 0 (no perception) to 10 (strong perception). The odour of the <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. sample was described as mainly <italic>resin-like</italic> with a high intensity of 7.2. The attributes <italic>frankincense-like</italic> (2.6) and <italic>carpenter&#x02019;s shop-like/sawdust-like</italic> (2.7) were rated with medium intensities. The attributes <italic>wood glue-like, herb-like, peppery</italic> and <italic>citrusy</italic> were recorded with intensities between 1.5 and 2.0. The remaining attributes reached intensities of 0.3 to 1.0 only, and were, accordingly, of minor relevance. To elucidate the underlying odorants representing these impressions in pine wood odour, the odour-active substances were characterised as described in the next section.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Odour profile of pine wood sample 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_26626_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e363"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterisation of the odorant composition</title><p id="Par7">To detect possible differences in odorants between particular trees, two additional <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. samples were analysed by GC-O. This led to the detection of a number of odour-active compounds in the undiluted extracts, with detection of a total of 44 odour-active compounds in the course of AEDA spanning the flavour dilution (FD) factor range from 9 to 729. Of these, 39 substances could be aligned with reference compounds based on the criteria given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Where no reference was available, this is indicated in the information provided.

It is interesting to note that &#x003b1;-pinene is one of the largest peaks in the chromatograms of each of the <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. samples. This, together with its relatively high odour potency, suggests that this terpene has a main impact on the overall odour impression of the wood samples. This finding is not surprising because &#x003b1;-pinene is long known to be an odorous constituent of pine wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

The <italic>pencil-like</italic> smell can be traced back to thymoquinone and the <italic>peppery</italic> note to &#x003b1;-bisabolol. <italic>Rubber-like/plastic-like/waxy</italic> notes may stem from a <italic>rubber-like</italic> smelling unknown substance, and hexanoic acid or heptanoic acid (both smelling, inter alia, <italic>plastic-like</italic>).

These odour impressions may be a result of mixed odour effects and may be further influenced by additive, synergistic and suppressive effects of all odorous constituents present in the wood. Previous studies showed that unexpected odorous impressions can arise from mixtures of odorants that can be barely predicted, such as the grapefruit-like note induced by a mix of mainly citrusy and black current-like odour notes as described for grapefruit aroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Future studies involving quantification and reconstitution experiments would be required to answer this question.</p><p id="Par15">The identified odorants in the <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. samples belong to a variety of substance classes that exhibit great diversity of odour character. A large number of these odour-active substances stem from fatty acid degradation. Fatty acids and waxes are part of the extractable fraction in wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Since wood is naturally exposed to sun and air, degradation processes of fatty acids are promoted, resulting in various alkenals, ketones, alkylic acids and intramolecular esters.

They occur in wood due to the degradation of lignin. Lignin is a macromolecule which consists of phenolic units and is located in the cell walls of wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Odour-active phenyl derivatives identified in the samples are vanillin (<italic>vanilla-like</italic>), 3-phenylpropanoic acid (<italic>vomit-like, fruity</italic>), phenylacetic acid (<italic>honey-like</italic>) and p-cresol (<italic>horse-like</italic>). Furthermore, thymoquinone, which smells <italic>pencil-like</italic>, can be included in this group as the formation of quinones results from the oxidation of phenols. Thymoquinone as a naturally occurring, pencil-like smelling substance is a new find in pine wood. However, in our recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> on incense cedar wood, thymoquinone was found to have an even higher odour potency, possibly being one of its key odorants. In pine wood the attribute pencil-like was rated only with an intensity of 1.0 during sensory evaluation whereas in incense cedar wood it was the most dominant odour impression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This reveals that even in those samples where thymoquinone was detected by olfactometry, it did not impact the overall smell of the pine samples as other compounds were present with much more sensory impact, thereby obviously covering the smell impression of this compound.</p><p id="Par18">Two substances had an androstenone-like, perfume-like smell.

However, their identity could not be satisfactorily confirmed due to a lack of respective reference compounds. At first sight, the appearance of such substances in plant material might be surprising. Nevertheless, sterols are known constituents in the extractable fraction of wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

It is interesting to note that the leather-like smelling substance (RI&#x02009;=&#x02009;2300) had an odour quality similar to 4-methylphenol and other phenolic compounds such as 4-ethylphenol (<italic>horse stable-like, faecal, phenolic</italic>; RI2168) and 2,3-dimethylphenol (<italic>phenolic, ink-like, leather-like</italic>; RI 2105); therefore the prospected substance is likely to have a phenolic core moiety.

However, as previous investigations on wood odorants were mainly based on hardwood used for barrel-making, this study provides the first targeted characterisation of odorous substances in pine wood. Pine wood contains a higher amount of resin. Thus, more terpenoic substances and higher amounts of terpenes are present in pine wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

For this aim, the following set-up was used:</p><p id="Par32">The analytical system consisted of two gas chromatographs (Varian CP-3800, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) connected via a cryo trap system (CTS 1, Gerstel GmbH &#x00026; CO KG, M&#x000fc;hlheim an der Ruhr, Germany). The first GC was equipped with a multi-column switching system MCS2 (Gerstel GmbH &#x00026; CO KG, M&#x000fc;hlheim an der Ruhr, Germany). Analytical capillaries were DB-FFAP (first oven, 30&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.32&#x02009;mm film thickness 0.25&#x02009;&#x000b5;m; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) and DB-5 (second oven, 30&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.32&#x02009;mm, film thickness 0.25&#x02009;&#x000b5;m; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). An uncoated fused silica capillary (2&#x02013;3.5&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.53&#x02009;mm) was used in the first oven as pre-column. Sample injection settings were the same as described for GC-MS/O analyses.</p><p id="Par33">The elution range containing the compounds of interest (selected by the injection of reference compounds or detected odour impressions at the ODP) was transferred from the first GC column into the cryo trap (cooled with liquid nitrogen to &#x02212;100&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) using the MCS system. After thermodesorption of the trap (250&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), the analytes were transferred into the second oven and separated on a capillary column of different polarity. At the end of the second capillary column, the eluent was split into an ODP (290&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and a mass spectrometer (Varian), enabling a simultaneous generation of mass spectra and the perception of the corresponding odour qualities of the respective odorants. All split capillaries were made of uncoated, deactivated fused silica material. Mass spectra were generated in the EI-full scan mode (m/z range 40&#x02013;400, 70&#x02009;eV).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Identification criteria</title><p id="Par34">All substances were identified based on their odour qualities and intensities, their retention indices (RI) on a FFAP column, and their mass spectra. The calculation of the retention indices was based on a series of homologous alkanes (C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>31</sub>, 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml in pentane)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These calculated RI values were compared to the RI values of reference compounds or literature data. Reference substances were analysed at concentrations in the range from 5 to 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml in the course of all GC-analyses, correlating to their respective intensities in the samples. In case that a comparison of mass spectra to those of reference substances was not possible, due to lack of authentic standards, they were compared to NIST Mass Spectral Library (Version 2.0, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par35">The study was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki.
