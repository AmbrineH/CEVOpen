Vector-borne diseases account for 17% of all infectious diseases resulting in 700,000 human deaths annually. Repellents are a primary tool for reducing the impact of biting arthropods on humans and animals. N,N-Diethyl-<italic>meta</italic>-toluamide (DEET), the most effective and long-lasting repellent currently available commercially, has long been considered the gold standard in insect repellents, but with reported human health issues, particularly for infants and pregnant women. In the present study, we report fatty acids derived from coconut oil which are novel, inexpensive and highly efficacious repellant compounds. These coconut fatty acids are active against a broad array of blood-sucking arthropods including biting flies, ticks, bed bugs and mosquitoes. The medium-chain length fatty acids from C<sub>8:0</sub> to C<sub>12:0</sub> were found to exhibit the predominant repellent activity. In laboratory bioassays, these fatty acids repelled biting flies and bed bugs for two weeks after application, and ticks for one week. Repellency was stronger and with longer residual activity than that of DEET. In addition, repellency was also found against mosquitoes. An aqueous starch-based formulation containing natural coconut fatty acids was also prepared and shown to protect pastured cattle from biting flies up to 96-hours in the hot summer, which, to our knowledge, is the longest protection provided by a natural repellent product studied to date.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>USDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1001098</award-id><award-id>KY008066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Junwei J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>USDA-ARS Innovation Fund</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">It is well-known that insect bites can cause local or systemic effects that lead to infectious or inflammatory responses in human and animals. Many blood-sucking insects (primarily in mosquitoes) transmit many pathogens primarily plasmodium (malaria), viruses causing West Nile, Zika, yellow fever, and dengue in humans, in addition to equine infectious anemia, and African swine fever in animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Biting flies, such as stable flies (<italic>Stomoxys calcitrans</italic>) and horn flies (<italic>Haematobia irritans</italic>), have been reported to not only reduce the productivity of livestock, and also to transmit Lumpy Skin Disease and Rift Valley viruses mechanically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, another two blood-sucking arthropods often found in urban environments, ticks and bed bugs, have recently experienced resurgences for which ticks are vectors of many human and animal pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The use of repellents has become one of the most efficient ways to prevent disease transmission and the discomfort associated with insect bites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. DEET (N,N-Diethyl-<italic>meta</italic>-toluamide), developed in 1944, is considered by many as the gold standard of insect repellents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Coconut oil&#x02019;s lack of repellency suggests that the large bulky nature of the triglyceride structure may play a role in determining the repellency properties and not the presence of ester moieties since methyl laurate, which also contains an ester moiety similar to the triglyceride structure, is a highly effective repellent in addition to exhibiting toxicity. Higher repellent efficacy against stable flies was observed from mixtures of medium chain length acids rather than individual fatty acids and demonstrates a synergistic effect in repellency. More work in this area is needed to better understand the relationship between their chemical structures and repellency properties, particularly in stable fly olfactory and/or contact reception mechanisms as one of the major repellent compounds, lauric acid, is not overly volatile.</p><p id="Par14">In addition to repellency against stable flies, the coconut fatty acids also repelled other blood-sucking insects including horn flies, bed bugs, brown dog ticks and lone star ticks.

Although the coconut fatty acids exhibited strong repellency against biting flies, bed bugs and ticks, a relatively high concentration of the coconut fatty acids was required at the minimum effective dosage in comparison to DEET in order to prevent biting from yellow fever mosquitoes. However, in our study no significant differences in biting protection was observed between the coconut fatty acids and DEET at concentrations above 25%.

By formulating the coconut fatty acids into an aqueous-based starch composite, an application is estimated to cost less than 0.1 US dollars per cattle.

In contrast, catnip oil, the best natural product repellent identified against biting flies so far, has less than 24-h of residual activity. Laboratory testing of an aqueous starch-based formulation containing 6.6 wt.% of coconut fatty acids prevented stable fly blood-feeding up to 7 days at room temperature (22&#x02013;23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C).

However, assays with individual bed bugs (tent assay) showed similar results to those with multiple bed bugs, indicating that the aggregation behavior did not counter or obscure these tests of repellency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C&#x02013;E</xref> with individual bed bugs).</p><p id="Par18">In conclusion, the present study has shown that fatty acids derived from coconut oil present stronger repellency against several blood-sucking insects, compared to the most commonly used repellent, DEET (3 out of 4 types). Over 90% of repellency against biting flies was demonstrated by coconut fatty acids and lauric acid, with two weeks of longevity in deterring blood feeding. Under field conditions, a low cost aqueous starch-based formulation of the coconut fatty acids provided up to 96&#x02009;hours of protection against biting flies on cattle, which may be the longest lasting repellent of its type reported to date. This low-cost formulation can be adopted by livestock producers against biting flies.

Plastic Petri dishes (11.4&#x02009;cm diameter by 3.8&#x02009;cm height) were used as experimental arenas. For each arena, the inner wall coated with a thin film of fluoropolymer resin, bottom covered with a piece of filter paper. Filter paper was cut into two equal parts, one half was treated with a repellent using a Potter spray tower at 2.16&#x02009;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> of ethanol solution, the other half was sprayed with equal volume of 95% ethanol. A small piece of filter paper also was treated with the same repellent and folded into a tent shape with the treated surface facing down. The paper tent was placed on the repellent treated side, and the dish was uncovered. For the control treatment, one half of the filter paper and the tent was treated with 95% ethanol, the other half was untreated. 95% ethanol was used as solvent. 10% DEET (v/v), and 10% coconut fatty acids (m/m) were used to evaluate their repellency against bed bugs. All filter papers were treated on the same day, each kind of treated papers (95% ethanol-treated, 10% DEET-treated, or 10% coconut fatty acids-treated) were divided into three groups. They were kept in our laboratory (25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 20% relative humidity (RH)) for 0, 3, and 7days before experiment. The repellency of chemicals against bed bugs was tested at 0, 3, 7 days after application. Each filter paper was used only once. Five nymphs (fourth-fifth instar) and five males (age was unknown) were released in the center of each dish, the number of bed bugs on each side of the dish was recorded after 24&#x02009;hours. All treatments were tested simultaneously. Each treatment was replicated 5&#x02013;8 times. The assays were started between 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;hours into the dark cycle. Experiments were conducted in a walk-in chamber at 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 20% RH, with a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D).

The test materials were carried out in 9.5&#x02009;cm inner diameter arena (ClimbUp Insect Interceptor&#x02122;, Memphis, TN, USA). The inner well of this arena was covered with white filter paper (9.0&#x02009;cm diam. Whatman, No. 2) that was fixed in place with double-sided tape to prevent bed bugs from getting beneath it. Test materials consisted of 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of a 10% (w/w) hexane solution of DEET, coconut fatty acids, or hexane only. Test materials were applied to a 1.75&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;cm piece of filter paper that was pleated along the shorter midline to form a tent. The hexane was allowed to evaporate for 1&#x02009;h before two tents were placed into the arena. Three different choice experiments were conducted: 1) Coconut fatty acids versus control; 2) DEET versus control; and 3) coconut fatty acids versus DEET. These test arenas were positioned in a wind tunnel so that different treatments were located across the wind line, and thus different treatments were isolated from each other. Arenas were placed on three levels of wire mesh shelf that was 0.7&#x02009;m wide, 0.25&#x02009;m deep, with 0.3&#x02009;m between levels. The wind tunnel was 1&#x02009;m wide by 0.9&#x02009;m high by 2.4&#x02009;m in length. The shelf and thus the arenas were placed only at the downwind end of the tunnel. The wind speed in the tunnel was 0.3&#x02009;m/s with air evacuated from the laboratory through a fume hood. Tents were held in a separate fume hood for 0, 3, 7, and 14 days before being introduced into an arena. At about 9&#x02009;h into the photophase, each bed bug was placed at the center point to the arena; equidistant from each tent. Room temperature during the choice test remained at 24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The position of bed bugs was noted at 16&#x02009;h after release, which was 1&#x02009;h after the initiation of the second photophase of the test. A total of 20 bed bugs were released with each treatment combination (at 0 d, 3 d, 7 d, and 14 d). Neither bed bugs nor tents were reused. Thus, a total of 240 insects were evaluated. The number of responses was analyzed by a binomial test using the null hypothesis that the two tents were chosen with equal probability. Insects that did not make a choice between the two tents (i.e., were wandering in the arena) were not included in the statistical analysis, but are shown in the figures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ticks</title><p id="Par30">Repellency against nymphs of the lone star ticks was determined by using the vertical paper assay described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;7&#x02009;cm rectangle of Whatman No. 4 filter paper was prepared by treating the central 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x02009;cm zone with a volume of 165&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of test solution. After drying, the paper strip was suspended from a bulldog clip hung from a holder. Ten lone star tick nymphs were released from a glass vial on the lower untreated end of the paper strip. Locations of the nymphs were recorded at 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15&#x02009;min. Ticks were considered repelled if they stayed on the lower untreated zone or fell off the filter paper without having crossed into the upper untreated zone. Each treatment/concentration included three replicates.</p><p id="Par31">For brown dog ticks, petri-dish bioassays were performed under controlled environmental conditions (at 27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 70% RH) in complete darkness, based on the methodology described by Bissinger <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The coconut fatty acid-treated filter papers were dried for 10&#x02009;min under a fume hood prior to use in the assays. Six ticks (three males and three females) were placed in each arena along the line formed by the junction of treated and untreated papers. Control assays were made using clean paper versus clean paper. The positions of the ticks were evaluated at 24&#x02009;h, 48&#x02009;h, 72&#x02009;h, 96&#x02009;h and 1 week after the beginning of each experiment. Each experiment was replicated 10 times, with new ticks, for each individual compound.</p><p id="Par32">In the Petri-dish bioassay repellency rates were determinate as the mean percentage ticks located on the untreated side of the Petri dish. The chi-square test was used for comparison of the tick choices, taking the significance level to be p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. When a higher significant proportion of ticks were found in the control side, the compound/concentration was considered as repellent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Mosquitoes</title><p id="Par33">Repellency was determined as the minimum effective dosage (MED, the minimum threshold surface concentration necessary to prevent mosquitoes from biting through the treated surface) of the coconut oil fatty acids to prevent bites through the fabric was first carried out at the USDA-ARS laboratory in Gainesville, FL. A 0.15&#x02009;g sample of coconut oil fatty acids and DEET standard were added to prepare in 2&#x02009;ml of solvent (acetone). Serial dilutions of the fatty acids and DEET were performed and each dilution was held in a separate vial. A 50&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> section of muslin cloth was added to each vial. Each volunteer wore each treated cloth to pinpoint the cloth which was treated with a concentration that failed (greater than or equal to 5 bites in one minute) and was next to an adjacent higher concentration passed (less than 5 bites in one minute). The lowest concentration passed was the MED for that test subject.

A second repellent bioassay was conducted at Anastasia Mosquito Control Station in Florida. The three human volunteers aged from 30&#x02013;60 involved in the second bioassay also followed the similar protocol approved by the Florida Human Use Institutional Review Board. An informed consent document was introduced to each individual volunteer in this study and received their approval for participation. Repellent treatments consisted of 1.0&#x02009;mL of coconut fatty acids, lauric acid and DEET (control was also included), which was pipetted onto the forearms of the volunteers and applied from the wrist to the elbow by a gloved person to ensure full coverage of repellent. Approximately every 30&#x02009;min from the start of the experiment each volunteer held their arm in a mosquito cage for 3&#x02009;min. Protection failure was indicated by 2 mosquitoes landing and probing for more than 3&#x02009;min on the treated area of the volunteer&#x02019;s arm. Control volunteers were rotated with the other volunteers of the repellency test for 10 secs to 1&#x02009;min to ensure that the mosquitoes still demonstrated attraction to hosts.

A mixture of hot (80&#x02013;90&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) deionized water (1500&#x02009;mL) and coconut fatty acids (152.0&#x02009;g) was stirred to crudely emulsify the mixture. To the hot slurry, a mixture of waxy starch (200.5&#x02009;g; moisture content 8.70%) and pectin (3.99&#x02009;g; moisture content 12.09%) was added and stirred vigorously. The resulting slurry was delivered to the jet cooker utilizing a Moyno progressing cavity pump (Robbins Meyers, Springfield, OH, USA) at a flowrate of 1&#x02009;l/min. The slurried mixture and steam were combined in a Penick and Ford hydroheater (Penford Corp, Cedar Rapids, IA, USA). Cooking temperature was 140&#x02009;&#x000b0;C using steam supplied at 448 kPa, and the hydroheater backpressure set at 275 kPa. Approximately 2100&#x02009;ml of a white opaque aqueous starch-coconut fatty acid mixture was collected and then cooled to room temperature while stirring (solids content ranged between 14&#x02013;16%, as determined by freeze-drying accurately weighed amounts of the solution in duplicate). The solids content varied between experiments due to dilution of the cooked dispersion with variable amounts of condensed steam. The final composite had a solids content of 14.20% and was composed of 45.0% coconut fatty acids, 55.0% starch, and 85.80% water. The actual amount of coconut fatty acids contained in the formulation was 14.6% &#x000d7; 0.45&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.6 wt.%. The starch encapsulated coconut fatty acid composite was warmed in hot water bath and stirred well before the application.

The repellency tests were carried out in North Platte (University of Nebraska, West Central Research and Extension Center), NE, USA. Tests were conducted using criteria specified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1980) and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Nebraska (IACUC protocol no. 06&#x02013;12&#x02013;053&#x02009;C). To test the effectiveness of the coconut fatty acid-based formulation, we used 12 heifers randomly assigned to two groups of six. Each cattle were an ear-tag number. Around 500&#x02009;ml of the formulation was topically applied onto the whole-body surface of each cattle (including 4 legs as well). Since starch based formulation without coconut fatty acids added showed no repellency against biting flies, the control group cattle were not treated to reduce animal stress caused by treatment. Testing was done in two separate pastures of equivalent carrying capacity ranging in size from 10 to 17 hectares. Pastures were randomly assigned to each treatment that will enable precise estimates of treatment and treatment by period effects. Battery driven Fimco&#x000ae; sprayers were calibrated and used to make the application to the legs and belly of each animal. Cattle were individually restrained using a cattle chute during spray application and then released into the test pasture for exposure to ambient biting fly populations. The total number of biting flies on all four legs and belly of each cow were counted and expressed as the total number of stable flies per animal. Counts will be made between 1300 and 1600 during predetermined intervals by the same individual. The counts started from day 1 through day 4 (starting from Tuesday till Friday each week). These counts were confirmed using Microsoft Image Viewer from a window-based computer to examine photographs taken from a Nikon digital camera (D60) during the observations. Comparisons between treated and control animals for numbers of flies observed were performed using Student t-test.
