    "Mg, Ca, and Ba catalysts supported on structured mesoporous silica oxides types MCM-41 and Al-SBA-15 were synthesized and investigated in sulfone cracking for sulfur removal from oxidized diesel fuel. Functional materials and catalysts were characterized by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption/desorption, transmission electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy techniques. Catalytic tests were carried out in fixed-bed and batch reactors with a model compound dibenzothiophene sulfone and oxidized diesel fraction as a feed. MgO/MCM-41 and MgO/Al-MCM-41 possess high activity in sulfone cracking. The sulfur content in the diesel fraction decreases from initial 450 up to 100 ppmw. Catalysts can be regenerated for reuse in several cycles and may be potentially scaled up for industrial applications."
