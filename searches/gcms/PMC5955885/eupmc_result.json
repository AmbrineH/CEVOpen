    "Tocopheryl fatty acid esters (TFAE) consist of tocopherols esterified to fatty acids, but only little is known about this substance class. In this study, twelve vegetable groups were screened on TFAE and contents of (free) tocopherols and TFAE were determined in red bell pepper, red chili pepper, cucumber and walnut (n = 5, respectively). Intact TFAE were separated by solid phase extraction from free tocopherols and analyzed by GC/MS. Highest TFAE values were determined in chili pepper (4.0-16 mg/100 g fresh weight, FW) and walnut (4.1-12 mg/100 g FW), followed by bell pepper (1.3-1.5 mg/100 g FW) and cucumber (0.06-0.2 mg/100 g FW). Contribution of TFAE to the total tocopherol content ranged from 7-84%. Neither the treatment with artificial digestion juices nor exposure to sunlight showed degradation of TFAE. This substance class might represent a hitherto overlooked storage form for free tocopherols in plants as they occur to be more stable. But as the ester bond in medium chain TFAE seems not to be fissile in the human body, they might not contribute in the same way as free tocopherols to the vitamin E activity of vegetables and might have to be determined separately."
