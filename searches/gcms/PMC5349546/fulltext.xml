Therefore, mimicking the ancient traditions of agarwood production in Assam (Northeast India), a chemometric assessment of the agarwood-fungus interaction was made by chemical profiling (GC-MS) coupled with statistical analysis (principal component, correlation network analysis) across three platforms, <italic>viz</italic>. callus, juvenile plants and resinous wood-chips with an associated <italic>Fusarium</italic>. In the study of callus-fungus interaction, increased accumulation of key aroma compounds such as pentatriacontane {fold change (log2FC)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.47)}, 17-pentatriacontene (log2FC&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.95), tetradecane, 2-methyl- (log2FC&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.10) over callus and activation of pathways related to defense and secondary metabolism indicated links to aroma production. Study on fungal interactions in juvenile plants and resinous wood-chips indicated formation of terpenoid precursors (e.g. farnesol, geranylgeraniol acetate) and agarwood sesquiterpenes (e.g. agarospirol, &#x003b3;-eudesmol). Correlation network analysis revealed the possible regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis involving squalene. Also a direct role of fungus in aroma (e.g. dodecane, 4-methyl-, tetracosane) was highlighted. Appearance of fragrant molecules unknown to agarwood during interaction featured as a new possibility for future research.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Plant based fragrances are the major constituents of commercial aroma and personal-care industry. Synthetic molecules, products of microbial fermentation and enzymatic conversion are also used apart from the traditional extraction from natural sources. However, the growing consumer preference for natural ingredients has led to renewed interest in biogenic fragrances. In this context, fragrant volatiles formed as a result of plant-microbial interactions is a potential option for the future. Biotechnological interventions including fermentation and microbial production of fragrant compounds are already being actively explored in the flavor and fragrance industry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Chemically, resinous agarwood is a complex mixture of more than 150 compounds among which sesquiterpenes are a major determinant of its unique fragrance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In the international market, agarwood drives trade worth 6&#x02013;8 billion USD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Natural agarwood formation is extremely rare and confined to a small geographical area. Moreover, the basic mechanism of agarwood formation is still unclear. This has seriously affected the level of R&#x00026;D involved in agarwood production and is still carried out by traditional methods. Scientific studies on agarwood have mostly focused on chemical profiling of wood and oils<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and production of agarwood compounds by artificial induction using chemical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, fungal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture interventions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.

In field, although it is believed that <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> plants only above the age of 10&#x02013;15 years are suitable for resin formation, a recent report of artificial induction of agarwood in juvenile (4 year old) plants by fungal infection has opened new possibilities in agarwood production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. There is a large research need in agarwood that takes into account the diversity of interactions resulting in a complex aroma. The opportunity of comprehensive phenotype level studies (proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics) to understand fungus-agarwood interaction is yet to be explored. Two previous studies conducted on these aspects included transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of healthy and resinous agarwood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, these studies did not focus on the plant-fungal interaction. Therefore, the present study for the first time uses metabolomic approaches (GC-MS, multivariate statistics and correlation network analysis) across three different platforms of interaction (involving <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> and an associated <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp.) <italic>viz</italic>. callus, juvenile plant and fermentation of resinous wood-chips. It aims to find chemometric signatures that can explain agarwood formation and also scan the interaction landscape for new aroma compounds. This, apart from enhancing the basic understanding of agarwood formation can potentially broaden the base of agarwood aromatics for the future.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isolation of associated fungi and <italic>in vitro</italic> callus induction</title><p>Using PDA as culture media, a total of 33 fungal associates were isolated from resinous tissue of agarwood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table ST-1</xref>).

Correlation between the 52 compounds shared by the profiles of callus, fungus and interaction when plotted separately as networks generated clear-cut differences in network topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). A closer scrutiny of the networks based upon the findings from the metabolite profiles (callus, juvenile plants and fermentation of chips) was performed by studying the correlation pattern (partners and nature of correlation) of few important compounds. In case of squalene, the number of significant correlations increased from 0 (fungus) and 7 (callus) up to 27 (interaction) as its level decreased over callus and fungus. Due to such changes the network topology was altered to accommodate newer correlations. Interestingly, squalene demonstrated negative correlations with 15 compounds only during interaction. Similarly, in case of tetrapentacontane 1, 54-dibromo-, the number of correlations decreased from 29 (fungus) and 17 (callus) to 5 (interaction) as the concentration of the compound increased during interaction and as a consequence the network topology changed. A closer look at the pattern revealed its consistently positive correlation with tetracosane, an important agarwood compound in callus, fungus as well as interaction. However, correlation profile of tetracosane revealed 5 interactions which included positive correlation with dodecane, 4-methyl, which is another important fragrant molecule. Apart from this, a similar pattern of change in the network topologies for compounds shared by callus and interaction as well as fungus and interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures SF-4 and SF-5</xref>) clearly indicate substantial metabolic modifications induced by interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Fusarium</italic> and agarwood</title><p>Metabolite profiling and multivariate statistical tools were able to distinguish chemically significant interactions and identify promising fungal associates.

Linoleic and linolenic acid are the precursors for lipoxygenase (LOX) that initiates the octadecanoate and lipoxygenase pathways responsible for the formation of jasmonates and leaf volatiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Among the terpenes, geranyl isovalerate with its fruity aroma is an important semio-chemical (pheromone). Reported both from <italic>Aquilaria</italic> as well as <italic>Fusarium</italic>, it assumes significance as insect infestation can predispose agarwood to fungal infection. Among the known agarwood compounds (9), a majority (4) were alkanes. Alkane biosynthesis in plants although poorly understood is important to stress response, particularly in the formation of cuticular wax. Wax forms as an acyl chain by the condensation-elongation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The acyl chain is subsequently modified to include 1&#x000b0; and 2&#x000b0; alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and terpenoids apart from long chain fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In the present study, formation of alkanes (e.g. 2-methyltetracosane, triacontane-1, 30- dibromo), aldehydes (e.g. E-15- heptadecanal), alcohols, esters and other compounds (e.g. malonic acid, 2-methylpentyl undecyl ester) were notable. The contribution of fungus to the fragrant profile is remarkable as seen in geranyl isovalerate (from <italic>Aquilaria</italic> as well as <italic>Fusarium</italic>), cyclohexanol, 4-methyl-1-(1-methylethyl)-, benzoic acid, 4-methyl-, i-propyl 12- methyltetradecanoate, tetradecanal and pentadecane, 4-methyl-. Also the effect of fermentation can be seen from accumulation of compounds such as fumaric acid esters that are known to be formed during submerged fermentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Compounds shared by callus and interaction</title><p>The compounds that decreased during interaction were mostly alkanes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table ST-4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Hexadecane, 2-methyl-, heptadecane, 8-methyl- and hentriacontane, are constituents of the protective wax layer in plants. The reduced level of wax is therefore an apparent indication of infection. However, the perception of cuticular wax by fungus and the host plant is very complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Fungal enzymes such as cutinases are responsible for the breakdown of cuticular components such as waxes to facilitate penetration. In early infection, the enzymatic breakdown products of cuticle become the inherent cellular signal perceived by the plant which plays the role of initial elicitor of a defense response. Interestingly, at pre-penetration stage the production of such enzymes (cutinases) by the fungus is activated by the perception of the cuticular wax on the plant cell surface itself. Therefore, onset of pathogenic interaction can be linked to the reduction in cuticular wax content of the callus. On the other hand, phthalates that are important perfume ingredients including agarwood showed increase in level. Other compounds that increased were 17-pentatriacontene (an important constituent of agarwood oil), 3-heptadecanol (a perfume fixative) and tetradecane, 2, methyl-. Of the 14 compounds that showed moderate to low increase, tridecane (wax) is an elicitor of jasmonate and salicylic acid pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Conversion of palmitic acid by esterification was the likely reason for palmitic acid isobutyl ester formation. The compounds such as hexahydrofarnesyl acetone enhanced the possibility of formation of aromatic compounds by availability of substrate. Increase in content of oxalic acid esters is of interest since pathogenesis and oxalate secretion by fungi are correlated and also of their role in lignocellulosic degradation might be linked to agarwood formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Compounds shared by fungus and interaction</title><p>Fungi are known to form unusual secondary products such as halogenated acids during stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Therefore increased production of fluorinated acid esters is an indication of secondary product formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table ST-5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Phenol, 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)- was reported previously in agarwood aromatics and is also a component of several fungal aromatic profiles including <italic>Fusarium</italic>. This reinforces the view that the fungal associate undergoes considerable physiological modifications during interaction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Compounds shared by all three: callus, fungus and interaction</title><p>The core metabolite profile showed that apart from the plant, the fungal associate contributes substantially (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table ST-6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Among the core set of 52 compounds, 17 (32.69%) were reported in agarwood as against only 9 out of 54 compounds (16.67%) in interaction. The frequency was still lower in case of other profiles in the present study. It was further noted that 16 out of the 17 known agarwood compounds were also present in profiles of both plant essential oils and fungi, which further points to the combined role of fungal and plant metabolites in the final agarwood aroma. Tetrapentacontane, 1,54, dibromo-, a constituent of fragrant essential oils and pentatriacontane, an important agarwood component increased considerably. Accumulation of compounds such as 11-methyldodecanol and heptane, 3,3,5-trimethyl- in relatively high concentration during interaction suggests lipid oxidation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Squalene, a triterpene showed an overall reduction over both callus and fungus during interaction. Vogeli and Chappell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> have shown in fungal elicitor treated tobacco suspension culture that the conversion of isoprenoid intermediates (farnesyl diphosphate) into sesquiterpenes was linked to an increase in sesquiterpene cyclase activity and a co-ordinated decrease in the squalene synthetase activity obviously to channelize the flux towards sesquiterpene instead of triterpene.</p><p>In the profile of interaction although important agarwood aroma compounds were formed or enhanced, the key agarwood sesquiterpenes were absent. This indicates a possibility of regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis at metabolic check-points. Transcriptomic analysis on a time-scale manner would likely reveal such regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Infection of juvenile <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> plants and fermentation of resinous agarwood chips with associated <italic>Fusarium</italic> (H15)</title><p>Natural agarwood formation is considered to be influenced by age of plant (more with maturity) and season (wet higher than dry). The inherent softness of agarwood tissue and the predominantly wet and humid climate prevailing in the South and Southeast Asia where agarwood is found, provide a unique environment for prolonged fungal contact leading to infection and fermentation. The fermentation of resinous chips with fungus provided the opportunity to understand another instance of microbial involvement with regard to agarwood production. In case of juvenile plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table ST-10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), appearance of 9, 12-octadecadienoic acid (Z, Z)- (linoleic acid) in injured control (Control-H) and fungus infected plants (H15) bear indication of the perception of threat and response due to fungal attack. Squalene, heneicosane, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, dodecane, heptadecane and tetradecane were detected in all juvenile tissues including plants not injured or inoculated with fungus. Squalene was detected in all juvenile tissues, but was absent in terpenoid rich resinous chips indicating that regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in agarwood might include squalene. From the distribution of metabolites in GC-MS profile of the fungus mediated fermentation of resinous agarwood chips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), the most significant finding was the appearance of key agarwood sesquiterpenes such as agarospirol, &#x003b3;-eudesmol, (&#x02212;)-aristolene exclusively during fermentation with <italic>Fusarium</italic> (H15). This indicates a major role of fermentation in determining the aroma content of agarwood reported in our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Fundamentally, fungus-callus and fungus-juvenile plant interaction are different from fermentation of chips with fungus as the resinous wood chips are dead tissue. Agarwood sesquiterpene are predominantly of plant origin. Therefore, the findings in the present study may be either because, a. fermentation of resinous wood provided unique substrates for fungal cellular/enzymatic machinery possibly involving biotransformation that led to appearance of aroma compounds including sesquiterpenes; b. fungal enzymatic machinery was activated during fermentation that led to increased release of sesquiterpenes from resinous mass embedded in the wood tissue and/or fungal sesquiterpene synthases were activated that led to formation of sesquiterpenes. There is an evidence of <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. secreting sesquiterpenes during plant-microbe interaction leading to morpho-physiological changes in the plant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Therefore, the follow up for these findings would be to establish the mechanism of fermentation assisted appearance of sesquiterpenes in the extracts. For this, intense time-scale studies would be necessary to dissect the fermentation process at different levels of phenotype (transcriptome, proteome and metabolome).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Correlation network analysis</title><p>The complexity of the interaction between fungus and agarwood was reflected in the perturbation of metabolites studied over three different platforms. Interpretation of such complex and large-scale datasets is challenging and therefore network visualisation of correlation can provide an unbiased analysis with application to untargeted metabolomics where the pair-wise correlations reflected the physiological state of the metabolite phenotypes in question<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The clear cut difference in network topology (shape and distribution) provided the initial estimate of the definite interaction between fungus and callus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The final concentration of a metabolite during interaction was likely influenced by suppression (decrease over callus as well as fungus, e.g. squalene), elicitation (major increase over callus, e.g. pentatriacontane) or complementation (major increase over fungus; e.g. tetrapentacontane, 1,54-dibromo-). In correlation networks, strong metabolite correlations may or may not mean that the compounds are neighbours in actual metabolic networks and pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Therefore a pragmatic approach was adopted in comparing the networks. In case of squlaene, absence of correlation in fungus and the appearance of 15 fresh negative correlations during interaction is interesting considering that a negative relation exists in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes and triterpenes (squalene). The newly observed negative correlations also included resinous agarwood compounds such as pentadecane, 2,6,10-trimethyl-, isopropyl myristate, 11-methyldodecanol and pentatriacontane which suggest a strong possibility of metabolite shift towards agarwood formation with decrease in squalene. Tetrapentacontane, 1, 54-dibromo- content increased during interaction and showed positive correlation with tetracosane, and dodecane, 4-methyl which are fragrant molecules. Scrutiny of the networks revealed that correlation exists in fungus and interaction but not in callus which further points at a possible fungal influence (tetracosane and dodecane, 4-methyl). In fermentation, dodecane, 4-methyl has been detected in soaked resinous wood (SR), resinous wood fermented with the fungal strain H15 as well as in the pure fungal strain while tetracosane formed only during fermentation of resinous wood with the fungus. Therefore correlation network analysis was able to indicate for the first time a definite possibility of fungal contribution in formation of important agarwood compounds.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The fragrant outcome of interaction</title><p>The fragrant outcome of plant-microbial interaction in agarwood is an extremely fascinating phenomenon. Agarwood production is confined to a few parts of South and Southeast Asia where humid climate is prevalent that encourages fungal growth. Agarwood tissue is soft by nature. Therefore, the injuries that are easily inflicted by herbivores, predispose genetically susceptible agarwood plants to prolonged fungal infection and fermentation leading to quality agarwood production. The depiction of the complexity of this association, established over centuries of co-evolution is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, adapted from the analogous host-pathogen interaction models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In the present study, <italic>Fusarium-</italic> agarwood interaction indicated typical perception-response mechanisms seen in biotic stress response involving waxes and cuticular barriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, cellular dynamics of free fatty acids leading to oxidative burst and activation of the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, from the point of view of aroma, fungal interaction between callus and juvenile plants resulted in fewer terpenoids compared to the fermentation of resinous agarwood chips. Wound associated signals have been found to be critical pre-requisites for strong expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes. In a recent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> the administration of heat shock (imitating the burn-chisel-drill method practiced in agarwood trees) on <italic>A. sinensis</italic> suspension cultures was found to induce jasmonate signaling that led to formation of agarwood sesquiterpenes. Acetyl CoA is at the check-point of primary and secondary metabolism. Wax biosynthesis, LOX (jasmonate pathway) and MVA pathway start at acetyl CoA. Therefore the nature of regulation at this point and at the beginning of MVA and MEP pathways (and their cross talk) during <italic>Aquilaria</italic> &#x02013;fungus interaction determines the formation of sesquiterpenes. A detailed time-point study on formation of key metabolites is necessary (e.g. levels of agarospirol, squalene, etc). The reason key agarwood sesquiterpenes were not detected during <italic>in vitro</italic> callus-fungus interaction is likely to be revealed by such studies. Nevertheless, the study has for the first time brought into focus the contribution of fungal metabolites (e.g. dodecane, 4-methyl, tetracosane) and non-terpene constituents like esters, alcohols towards the unique aroma of agarwood (e.g. 3-heptadecanol that confers fixative property). Further, from the <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture and fermentation the fragrant molecules hitherto unknown to agarwood aroma were accumulated. This offers a unique and exciting possibility for developing newer agarwood based aroma profiles that can be commercially exploited. From the mechanistic point of view, the appearance of ecologically important semio-chemicals (e.g. pheromones) during interaction pointed to an important aspect of agarwood production. The involvement of insect borer (<italic>Zeuzera conferta</italic>) is well known in case of Assam agarwood. The borer tunnels into the agarwood stem as it chews up the wood following which dark resinous deposits appear along the path taken by the borer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Whether semio-chemicals have a role in an insect-mediated fungal colonization of the inner agarwood tissue (heartwood) is an important question that requires proper study. Understanding the biotic interactions (plant-fungus-insect) can strengthen research on newer biogenic fragrances as well as answer fundamental questions on the complex regulation of the metabolic pathways during interaction resulting in aroma compound formation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Agarwood samples</title><p>Agarwood samples (resinous and non-resinous wood, agarwood oils, etc.) were collected from four major agarwood production sites of Assam in Northeast India <italic>viz</italic>.
