Abstract</div> <p>Recently, the occurrence of " <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback" has been frequent and devastating. <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback is caused by an endophytic fungus <i>Cenangium ferruginosum</i> in stressed pine trees. Progression of the disease in terms of molecular interaction between host and pathogen is not well studied and there is a need to develop preventive strategies. Thus, we simulated disease conditions and studied the associated transcriptomics, metabolomics, and hormonal changes. <i>Pinus koraiensis</i> seedlings inoculated with <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> were analyzed both under drought and well-watered conditions. Transcriptomic analysis suggested decreased expression of defense-related genes in <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>-infected seedlings experiencing water-deficit. Further, metabolomic analysis indicated a decrease in the key antimicrobial terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Hormonal analysis revealed a drought-induced accumulation of abscisic acid and a corresponding decline in the defense-associated jasmonic acid levels. Pathogen-associated changes were also studied by treating <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> with metabolic extracts from pine seedlings (with and without drought) and polyethylene glycol to simulate the effects of direct drought. From RNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis it was determined that drought did not directly induce pathogenicity of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>. Collectively, we propose that drought weakens pine immunity, which facilitates increased <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> growth and results in conversion of the endophyte into the phytopathogen causing dieback. </p> </div> <div class="funding-group" title="funding-group"> <div class="funding" title="funding">

Introduction</div> <p>Pine species are distributed in most regions of the northern hemisphere. Many species have been introduced to temperate and subtropical regions of the southern hemisphere as well. Pines have high economical value and are grown as timber. As pines are evergreen, they are also commonly cultivated as ornamental plants in parks and gardens. There are a number of pine diseases that affect the growth and survival of different pine species. One of the deadliest diseases is pine-dieback, which is caused by a number of fungal pathogens, e.g., <i>Cenangium ferruginosum</i>, <i>Mycosphaerella pini</i>, <i>Gremmeniella abietina</i>, and <i>Shaeropsis sapinea</i>, among others <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a> </sup>. Recently, the outbreak of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback (caused by <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>) has been frequent and devastating <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR2">2</a> </sup>. <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> is reportedly an endophytic fungus that lives as a biotroph in healthy pine trees and is considered a primary decomposer of weakened and dying trees <sup> <a href="#CR2">2</a> </sup>. However, under stressful conditions such as drought, extreme cold, unusual warm winters, and wounding, the endophytic fungus turns pathogenic, leading to detrimental consequences in pine trees <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. The disease is first marked by the appearance of needle necrosis. Subsequently, it spreads causing damage to twigs, branches, and eventually the whole tree (hence the name "dieback") <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. Currently, <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback cases are not frequently reported worldwide; however, a number of pine species were seriously affected by this disease in different regions of Korea in the spring of 2007 and 2009 <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> infects and damages different pine species in Korea, namely <i>Pinus densiflora</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>thunbergii</i>, and <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> <sup> <a href="#CR2">2</a> </sup>, but strong pathogenicity of the fungus was observed on <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i>. Importantly, a recent outbreak of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback was reported in early spring 2012 from several regions of Slovakia <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a> </sup>, suggesting a wide geographical spread in the occurrence of the disease, which is alarming. </p> <p>The defense system in pine species is well equipped with various molecular arsenals to combat pathogen attack. Most of them are considered to be mediated by phytohormone-dependent pathways. Necrotrophic fungi have been reported to largely activate the jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defenses in plants <sup> <a href="#CR4">4</a> </sup>. Once activated, these pathways lead to the production of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and induction of flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, thereby inducing the synthesis of secondary metabolites that act as antimicrobial agents in plant-microbe interactions <sup> <a href="#CR5">5</a> </sup>. Needles of pine trees are well known to have antimicrobial effects by virtue of different terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids that kill microbial cells. The major pine defenses against fungi are regulated by specialized chemicals namely terpenoids of oleoresin and phenolics <sup> <a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR7">7</a> </sup>. The role of terpenoids in tree-fungus interactions and associated biochemical pathways are characterized in conifer species <sup> <a href="#CR8">8</a>– <a href="#CR10">10</a> </sup>. Diverse and variable terpenoids of conifers exist as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, including the diterpene resin acids. Oleoresins, composed mostly of monoterpenes and diterpene resin acids, provide both physical as well as chemical defenses against microbes <sup> <a href="#CR11">11</a> </sup>. In general, pines produce and store large amount of terpenoids. Over 40,000 different terpenoids have been characterized so far in plants <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup>. Among them, several compounds are produced by primary metabolism, including some phytohormones, such as abscisic acid (ABA). However, the majority of them are secondary metabolites, which are known to have defensive roles and are species specific <sup> <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup>. Members of the <i>Pinus</i> genus are known to accumulate high levels of terpenoids, especially essential oils and resins, as defense compounds <sup> <a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR8">8</a>, <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup>. Terpenoids quantities and composition in the oleoresin and volatile emissions can vary dramatically according to the plant defensiveness, environmental conditions, and fungal attacks <sup> <a href="#CR8">8</a>, <a href="#CR14">14</a> </sup>. Besides terpenoids, the other important groups of bioactive compounds are flavonoids and phenolic acids. Flavonoids show diverse structure and a broad range of biological activities, with free aglycones and glycoside forms <sup> <a href="#CR15">15</a> </sup>. Phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids with an attached three carbon side chain and aromatic ring, exist in nature and have free and bound forms as esters and glycosides. The flavonoids and phenolic acids have protective roles against both microbial attack and environmental stresses <sup> <a href="#CR15">15</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Defense mechanisms of pines against <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> are considered to be complex and differ from those that are effective against other endophytic biotrophs. Studies addressing the conversion mechanism of an endophyte into a phytopathogen are largely lacking and thus the scientific knowledge in this area is still in its infancy. In the wake of the severity and continuing trend of the occurrence of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback, which has been frequent and covered a large geographical area, the development of preventive strategies is urgently required. To do so, however, it is important to first understand the molecular interaction between the host and the pathogen to shed light on the mechanism of disease progression. Necessitated by this, we studied the progression of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback at the molecular level from the perspective of both the host and the pathogen. Because <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> exhibits high pathogenicity in <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i>, making it an important case to study, we chose this pine species as a model in our work. In our study, we investigated the pathogenicity of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> in <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> with and without drought stress treatment to elucidate the mechanisms of dieback progression. The interaction between the <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> and <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> was studied at the transcriptome level, using an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. Additionally, the alteration in compounds (terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolics) related to immunity in <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> induced by <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> and subsequent drought was also examined. The effect of drought on the pathogenicity of the fungus was also taken into consideration. Our results suggested that drought weakens <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> immunity against <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>, by virtue of reduced expression of the pine’s defense genes and secondary metabolites. This facilitates increased fungal growth leading to the development of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback disease. We believe that our study is a major advance in this field, which will accelerate/facilitate further studies. This will eventually lead to the design of fruitful combative strategies. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Generation of RNA-sequencing <i>de novo</i> assembly of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> </div> <p>Sets of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> transcriptomes were prepared under different biological conditions, representing growth and pathogenicity <i>in vitro</i>.

Discussion</div> <p>The detrimental consequences and increasing frequency of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback makes understanding the biology of this disease important in the development of preventive strategies. Recently, the high-throughput omics data attributing the plants’ interaction with <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> (another important necrotrophic plant fungal pathogen) has been suggested to be amply useful for genetic improvement of plants against gray mold disease <sup> <a href="#CR19">19</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a> </sup>. This further highlights the usefulness and pressing need of a detailed study revealing the molecular complexities behind the progression of die-back disease in pine. Necessiated by the above arguments, our study focused on developing a profound knowledge of the molecular interaction between <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i>, with an aim to reveal the progression of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback in plausible molecular terms. </p> <p> <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>, which otherwise is a pine endophyte, turns pathogenic with the advent of stressful conditions, such as drought <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. Under drought stress, the asymptomatic biotrophic fungus exhibits a peculiar hemibiotrophic life cycle, which is marked by dieback symptoms – destructive plant necrosis. Under conditions favorable for pine trees, the asymptomatic biotrophic phase of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> lasts for a long time without any dieback symptoms. We thus simulated the disease conditions by infecting healthily growing pine seedlings with <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> and withholding water post infection to cause drought stress. Concurrence of pathogen infection and drought for 42 d or more showed necrotic dieback symptoms unlike the watered seedlings, suggesting the successful simulation of the disease progression. After establishing the disease symptoms, we next studied the molecular interaction between the host and pathogen in terms of transcriptomic, metabolomic, and hormonal alterations. </p> <p>The development of a disease largely depends on the molecular interplay between the pathogen and its host, which involves substantial transcriptional changes in both organisms <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. Consequent to a complex interaction between host and pathogen, the gene expression changes in both organisms are highly regulated and dynamic <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a> </sup>. To study such dynamic alterations in transcriptomes associated with both host and pathogen, the concept of ‘dual RNA-seq’ was introduced <sup> <a href="#CR22">22</a> </sup> and has already been used comprehensively in several previous studies <sup> <a href="#CR21">21</a>, <a href="#CR23">23</a> </sup>. Using a similar approach in this study, we could identify transcripts that were significant during the biotrophic interaction between <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> and <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>: 86 and 99 million reads mapped to plant and fungal gene models, respectively. From the gene expression results, it becomes obvious that under well-watered conditions the pine tree’s defense against <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> remained activated, although insufficiently to suppress the growth of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> completely, and the defense-related pine genes <i>CA</i>, <i>ASNS</i>, and <i>KR3</i>, were highly expressed in the control (infected seedlings with optimal water supply). Similarly, with the advent of drought, where the unaffected fungal gene expression enables the fungus to overgrow, pine tree tries its best to counteract it. The overexpression of <i>MYBPA1</i>, <i>MYB5</i>, belonging to R2R3-MYB transcription factor family, member of which have already been shown to play important role in plant’s tolerance against the necrotrophic plant pathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> <sup> <a href="#CR24">24</a>, <a href="#CR25">25</a> </sup>, is an indicative of the triggered defensive mode. However, plant still fails to mount an effective defense against the overgrowing pathogen as the other important defense-related pine genes, including <i>CA</i>, <i>ASNS</i>, and <i>KR3</i>, were down-regulated. CA plays a role in plant immunity through oxidative stress protection <sup> <a href="#CR26">26</a> </sup>. ASNS plays a key role in nitrogen remobilization, which is important and modulated in parallel to defense responses <sup> <a href="#CR27">27</a> </sup>. KR3 plays an important/primary role in detection of pathogens and elicitation of defense responses. This might have resulted in an oxidative burst and reduced elicitation of defense responses. Additionally, the various transmembrane and intracellular receptor-like kinases/proteins (putative immune receptors) that remained induced under optimal water supply declined remarkably under drought stress. Altogether, this possibly resulted in decreased immunity of the pine trees, which enabled the unaffected fungus to overgrow and cause dieback disease. </p> <p>Corroboratively, the RNA-seq data showed a clear increase in the percentage of reads mapping to <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> in infected pine seedlings exposed to drought (7.49% and 7.59% in control and treatment, respectively), which suggested that more <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> genes were expressed when plants experienced drought post infection. Overall, it is amply clear that the interaction between <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> biotrophic hyphae and pine tree cells continues for a long time under optimal conditions and the plant succeeds in keeping a check on the fungal growth. In other words, <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> and pine trees establish a mutualistic association, which is also marked by the absence of the expression of the marker gene indicative of pathogen attack – the pine <i>PR1</i> gene. Similar observations are reported previously in several biotrophic pathogens <sup> <a href="#CR28">28</a>, <a href="#CR29">29</a> </sup>. However, an episode of drought weakens plant immunity, thereby enabling the endophytic fungus to overgrow, become a pathogen, and cause dieback. This is also marked by the increased expression of the pine <i>PR1</i> gene in infected seedlings experiencing drought. Finally, our first of its kind transcriptomic analysis thus presents an inventory of possible candidate genes in pine that can be targeted for genetic improvement of pines specifically against <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback disease. Certainly, it first requires extension of this pioneering work through more directed research in the future. </p> <p>The unavailability of complete genome sequences of both <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> limited the possibility of more detailed analyses/inferences from the transcriptomics results. We thus extended our study to also reveal related consequences that may account for the susceptibility of pine trees for <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback under drought conditions. Precisely, we chose to screen the alterations in the levels of terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolics, which are well known antimicrobial compounds synthesized in pine species. Indeed, a significant difference in the terpenoid production/levels was noted in the pine seedlings growing under well-watered and drought conditions post <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> infection. The concentrations of most of the terpenoids, such as 3-carene, β-caryophyllene, phytol, α-terpineol, isolongifolene, ethyl heptadecanoate, and ethyl linolenate, decreased significantly in the needle/stem tissues of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum-</i>infected pine seedlings exposed to drought stress. In previous studies, drought stress was noted to increase the concentrations of terpenoids in wood and needles of conifers <sup> <a href="#CR30">30</a> </sup>. Interestingly, however, our study suggests that the combination of pathogen-infection and drought had a contrasting effect on the terpenoid profiles. We thus hypothesized that the lowered levels of terpenoids weakened plant defenses and made it more prone to disease. Along with terpenoids, the levels of flavonoids and phenolic acids, which constitute the major bioactive compounds in plants and are important in defense against pathogens <sup> <a href="#CR15">15</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>, were also significantly reduced in drought-exposed <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum-</i>infected seedlings. Overall, a significant decrease in the levels of secondary compounds in the constitutive resin was noted in drought stressed pine seedlings (both non-infected and infected). We thus believe that drought stress triggered a reduction of these compounds and decreased the immunity of pine trees against <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>, which lead to the development of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback in pine seedlings. </p> <p>Phytohormones play a critical role in plant development against many biotic and abiotic environmental factors. Different phytohormones and associated signaling may interact in a synergistic or an antagonistic manner, which results in a customized developmental response. Many previous studies have strikingly noted that disease resistance and drought tolerance are often antagonistic <sup> <a href="#CR31">31</a> </sup>. These effects were attributed to the activation of the ABA pathway under drought stress <sup> <a href="#CR32">32</a>, <a href="#CR33">33</a> </sup>, which through antagonism suppresses SA-, JA-, and ethylene-mediated signaling pathways and thus the disease resistance in plants <sup> <a href="#CR31">31</a> </sup>. In agreement with these reports, we too noted an increment in ABA levels and a corresponding decline in JA levels with progressing drought. JA is believed to play a significant role in plant defenses against necrotrophic and biotrophic fungal pathogens <sup> <a href="#CR4">4</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a> </sup>. We therefore propose that reduced levels of JA weakened the ability of pine seedlings to mount an effective defense against <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>, which resulted in the development of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback disease. </p> <p>Drought stress is well known to decrease the host resistance and/or increase nutritional value of the plants, which accelerates fresh pathogen infections and disease outbreaks <sup> <a href="#CR30">30</a>, <a href="#CR34">34</a> </sup>. However, in case of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback, it is important to note that the <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> that colonizes the host plant is already present as an endophyte and causes disease only after a drought episode. We thus questioned whether drought stress that reduces the immunity of pine seedlings also affects the pathogenicity of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i>. If yes, how does the pathogen develop the disease? Although the gene expression analysis suggested that there was no adverse effect of drought on <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> growth and pathogenicity, we confirmed it at the level of fatty acid contents in the fungus. <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> grown in metabolic extracts of well-watered, as well as drought-stressed pine seedlings, and PEG were studied to look for any change in fatty acids. Interestingly, no remarkable difference/effect on the contents of the studied fatty acids was noted. This suggested that environmental drought reduces only the pine’s immunity, and does not impose any indirect negative effect on the pathogenicity of the fungus. This unaffected virulent state of the pathogen combined with the drastically reduced ability of the plant to mount a defense facilitated the development of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback in drought-stressed pine seedlings. </p> <p>In conclusion, we present a comprehensive study entailing the metabolomic (e.g., resin, essential oil, flavonoid, and phenolic acid) and transcriptomic changes possibly responsible for conversion of an endophyte to a pathogen under drought stress. In so doing, we bring forth the molecular mechanisms that (1) <i>P</i>. <i>koraiensis</i> uses to control the development and virulence of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> under optimal conditions, and (2) lead to the development of disease under drought stress (Fig. <a href="#Fig8">8</a>). Hitherto, the information about transcriptional alterations entailing host-pathogen interaction regarding <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback was insufficient. Our study, as it reports a transcriptomic analysis of the interaction of <i>C</i>. <i>ferruginosum</i> and pine seedlings under drought stress, will vastly expand our knowledge of <i>Cenangium</i>-dieback disease. It will open the window for more detailed analysis of disease progression in the future. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 8</span> </a> </div>   <p>Summary of the mechanism of drought-induced susceptibility for <i>Cenangium ferruginosum</i> in <i>Pinus koraiensis</i>. </p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
