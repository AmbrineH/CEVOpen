Indigenous to Africa, this crop exhibits high levels of drought tolerance and an ability to grow under low nutrient conditions, which allows it to be sustainably grown on marginal lands [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sorghum is an ideal system for bioenergy research due its relatively small diploid genome (~730 Mb) and a wide range of genetic resources that includes a high quality reference genome [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Improving biomass yields and biomass composition are necessary to foster the replacement of petroleum-derived chemical precursors with those derived from lignocellulosic sources [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Cell walls, which are comprised of three main polymers cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, are a major target for improving bioenergy conversion of sorghum biomass into biofuels and other renewable products [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lignin polymers are cross-linked to a hemicellulose network, and essential to the viability of land plants, however lignin impedes deconstruction of plant cell wall polysaccharides into fermentable sugars and substantially increases the costs of cellulosic ethanol production [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, considerable efforts have been directed toward altering lignin concentration and composition. Recently, there has been increasing interest in developing ways to valorize lignin for a range of applications [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The monolignol biosynthesis pathway is a major target for altering lignin content and composition, because this well-characterized and highly conserved pathway across vascular plants synthesizes the monomers of lignin polymers [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Lignin is polymerized through the oxidative radicalization of three major monolignols; <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols, which form <italic>p-</italic>hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) lignin subunits, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204153.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Mutational, antisense and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches have been successfully used to impair the function of genes encoding monolignol biosynthetic enzymes, and have resulted in plants with reduced lignin content in several species [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In sorghum and other C<sub>4</sub> grasses, the <italic>brown midrib (bmr)</italic> phenotype has been useful to identify a non-redundant set of mutants impaired in lignin synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Three sorghum <italic>Bmr</italic> genes have been characterized and shown to encode enzymes in monolignol biosynthesis; <italic>Bmr2</italic> (4-coumarate-CoA ligase, 4CL), <italic>Bmr6</italic> (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, CAD) and <italic>Bmr12</italic> (caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, COMT) [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0204153.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204153.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The monolignol biosynthesis pathway in sorghum based on consensus model from dicot and monocot plants (adapted from [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</title><p>Enzymes along the pathway (gray) represent: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase: HCT, <italic>p</italic>-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; C3H, 4-coumarate hydroxylase; CSE, caffeoyl shikimate esterase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA-O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CALDH, cinnamyl aldehyde dehydrogenase CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. Gray lines indicate proposed steps in the pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0204153.g001"/></fig><p>In addition to COMT, the other <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent <italic>O-</italic>methyltransferase, caffeoyl coenzyme-A <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is involved in monolignol biosynthesis. This enzyme preferentially catalyzes the methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group of caffeoyl-CoA to generate feruloyl-CoA that is required for the synthesis of both G- and S-lignin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204153.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In contrast, COMT preferentially catalyzes the methylation of the 5-hydroxyl group of 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde to produce sinapaldehyde in the synthesis of S-lignin. In some cases, these two methyltransferases may function interchangeably in the methylation of their preferred forms of caffeoyl or 5-hydroxyconiferoyl groups [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, sorghum COMT can utilize caffeic acid, 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde and 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol as substrates, but not caffeoyl alcohol or caffeoyl-CoA [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, sorghum CCoAOMT displayed a strong preference for caffeoyl-CoA as a substrate, and did not efficiently bind nor has enzymatic activity for 5-hydroxyferuloyl-CoA or caffeic acid [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These studies indicate the function of COMT is in the synthesis of S-lignin, whereas the function of CCoAOMT is to synthesize feruloyl-CoA.</p><p>Feruloyl-CoA is a substrate for cinnamoyl-Coenzyme A reductase (CCR) of monolignol synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, feruloyl-CoA is the substrate for ester-linked ferulates within cell walls [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which are major features of grass cell walls together with other esterified hydroxycinnamic acid residues. Both ferulic and <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acids can be esterified to arabinose residues of glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAX) through the activity of BAHD acyltransferases using feruloyl-CoA and coumaroyl-CoA as substrates [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which ultimately leads to cross-linking between GAX polymers, lignin and structural proteins in cell walls [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The creation of these cross-linkages is hypothesized to enhance defenses against pathogen invasion [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

The results of this study demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> was sufficient to stimulate the biosynthesis of ferulate and sinapate, which led to their incorporation into cell walls as soluble and esterified groups and increased energy content of sorghum stover.</p><p>Genes of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway have been targeted using antisense and RNAi engineering techniques to lower lignin content and alter lignin composition of plants and improve deconstruction of cell walls for the conversion into liquid biofuels [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In contrast, few studies have evaluated the consequences of overexpression or ectopic expression of these genes in herbaceous plant species. This strategy provides a means to increase enzyme concentration and rate of reaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, which can lead to increased energy content of biomass for thermal conversion, and higher levels of phenolic compounds in biomass for chemical end-uses. Previously, the consequences of inducing lignin synthesis through the overexpression of a transcriptional activator <italic>SbMyb60</italic> were evaluated in grain sorghum. Overexpression of this transcription factor in sorghum resulted in increased lignin content and increased levels of aromatic compounds, which elevated total energy levels in sorghum biomass. However, overexpression of <italic>SbMyb60</italic> affected growth and development of sorghum resulting in reduced height, delayed flowering and altered plant architecture. [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The overexpression of <italic>CCoAOMT</italic> overexpression in sorghum did not significantly affect growth, unlike the downregulation of <italic>CCoAOMT</italic> through RNAi or antisense tools other plant species [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Although this enzyme is required for the synthesis of both G and S subunits, <italic>CCoAOMT</italic> suppression in maize, alfalfa, Arabidopsis and tobacco led to reductions in G subunits, lignin concentrations and plant growth [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Overall, levels of S lignin were not impacted in any of these studies. In contrast, our findings showed that stover from mature plants did not differ in terms of S/G ratio or levels of subunits S-lignin and G-lignin between <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> and wild-type, which indicated the increased levels of <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> did not impact lignin composition. In addition, analysis of both Klason and ADL lignin concentrations demonstrated that lignin was unaffected in stover and no detectable differences in growth or development were observed in <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> overexpression lines. Thus, <italic>CCoAOMT</italic> overexpression alone is not sufficient to increase lignin or alter its composition in sorghum.</p><p>While overexpression of <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> did not impact lignin, it did increase the accumulation of soluble and wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acids in the stover. Both transgenic events accumulated higher levels of ferulate and sinapate in both cell wall-bound and soluble fractions from stover, which are products derived from monolignol biosynthesis. The higher levels of these compounds likely result from the accumulation of feruloyl-CoA, the product of CCoAOMT. Similarly, both ferulate and sinapate levels were elevated when <italic>SbMyb60</italic> was overexpressed <italic>in planta</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Although the likely route from feruloyl-CoA to sinapic acid is through the monolignol biosynthesis enzymes CCR, F5H and COMT, alternative paths may exist. In alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic>), MsCCoAOMT is able to methylate 5-hydroxyferuloyl-CoA [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], which could in part explain the increased levels of sinapic acid in the <italic>CCoAOMT</italic> overexpression lines. However, no enzymatic activity was detected with 5-hydroxyferuloyl-CoA as the substrate for SbCCoAOMT, and its protein structure and substrate docking indicated there are steric clashes within active site that likely prevent substrate binding [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Higher levels of esterified phenolic acids in the cell wall were also observed under fluorescence microscopy in the stalks from both transgenic events. Cell wall autofluorescence has been associated with esterified ferulic acid residues [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Thus, the increased autofluorescence and phloroglucinol staining observed in <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> transgenic stalks are likely the result of increased esterified ferulic acid and sinapic acid residues in cell walls. Deposition of esterified ferulate is also a plant defense response against biotic incursion [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and the induction and accumulation of CCoAOMT transcripts and protein has previously been observed in pathogen incursion [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Here, <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> overexpression resulted in the accumulation of cell wall-bound ferulic acid without an elicited defense response, which could ultimately lead to increased resistance to pests and pathogens.</p><p>An intriguing outcome of the current study was the substantial increases in total energy of sorghum biomass from the <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> overexpression lines compared to wild-type without any observable negative impacts on plant growth or changes to lignin content. The total energy levels in <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> biomass were elevated by 60&#x02013;75 cal g<sup>-1</sup>, which represents a considerable increase in total energy per gram of biomass. Overexpression of <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> appears to increase the amount of energy captured and stored in sorghum biomass. Based on the energy levels of neutral and acid detergent washed stover, the increased energy observed in the CCoAOMT overexpression lines can be attributed to cell wall bound (esterified) phenolic compounds, whose linkages are resistant to neutral detergent, but not to acid detergent. Similarly, overexpression of the sorghum <italic>SbMyb60</italic> transcription factor led to the identification of one line (Myb<italic>-</italic>ZG-124-1-2a) whose <italic>SbMyb60</italic> expression level was only modestly elevated relative to wild-type. While ADL and Klason lignin levels did not differ between stover collected from Myb<italic>-</italic>ZG-124-1-2a and wild-type, this line had higher total energy levels compared to wild-type and to the rest of the <italic>SbMyb60</italic> lines included in the study, and the soluble and wall bound hydroxycinnamates (caffeic, ferulic and sinapic acids) were also elevated relative to wild-type in this line [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The results from both the <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> and <italic>SbMyb60</italic> overexpression studies suggest that increasing levels of ester-linked phenolic compounds, such as ferulic and sinapic acids, contributes to energy levels in biomass. Although <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> overexpression increases the availability of both feruloyl and sinapoyl groups for esterification in the cell wall, no changes in G- or S- lignin were observed, which indicates that the induction of additional pathway steps are necessary to incorporate these subunits into the lignin polymer.</p><p>RNA-seq analysis allowed for a comprehensive view of how overexpression of <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> impacted both global gene expression and the expression levels of genes coding monolignol biosynthetic enzymes in sorghum. Overall, overexpression of <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> did not affect the expression of genes encoding monolignol biosynthetic enzymes, except for <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> (Sobic10G052200.1), whose elevated transcript levels also resulted in the accumulation of the corresponding protein in both transgenic lines (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204153.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204153.g008">8</xref>). The expression levels of PAL, which catalyzes the first step of monolignol biosynthesis pathway, was significantly up-regulated only in <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic>-9a leaf and stalk tissues. In contrast to our study, repression of <italic>CCoAOMT</italic> in petunia, via RNAi, downregulated the expression of a <italic>CCR</italic> gene, whose gene product catalyzes next step in the monolignol biosynthesis following CCoAOMT [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In general, these results show that altering expression of <italic>CCoAOMT</italic> causes only minor perturbations to expression levels of genes encoding monolignol biosynthetic enzymes.</p><p>Although overexpression of <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> did not have a major impact on global gene expression in either stalks or leaves, the expression of genes encoding enzymes linked to cell wall biosynthesis were elevated in <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> lines and correlates with patterns of gene-expression network analyses. Expression levels of a DAHP synthase (Sobic.001G351000) and a shikimate kinase (Sobic.006G235500), which both encode enzymes in aromatic amino acid synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], were also elevated in the two transgenic lines compared to wild-type in stalk tissues. Higher expression of DAHP synthase and shikimate kinase transcripts and higher levels of shikimate quantified through metabolite profiling indicate that <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> overexpression may stimulate flux through the shikimate pathway, which ultimately lead to the synthesis of aromatic amino acids required for the monolignol biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although DEG analysis presented relatively few genes associated with cell wall biosynthesis, WGNCA analysis corroborated patterns of genes up-regulated in stalk tissue for both transgenic events that were related to pentose phosphate pathway, aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Hence, <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> overexpression may result increases in the substrate and cofactors required monolignol pathway.</p><p>Utilization of biomass as a carbon-neutral resource has received increased attention due to its availability, sustainability, renewability and energy security [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204153.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Thermochemical conversion of biomass spans a range of technologies, which includes pyrolysis, gasification and direct combustion. Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass, and leads to valuable products including char, liquid (tar and oil) and gas products (syngas) [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. We demonstrate overexpression of CCoAOMT can increase the energy density of biomass, which may be beneficial to thermoconversion processes. Alternatively, ferulic acid is a potential valuable co-product from the hydrolysis of biomass to produce sugars from cell wall polysaccharides, and it has a wide range of biomedical applications that include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, UV-protectant and anti-microbial activities with potential usage in nutraceutical, cosmetic and food products [<xref rid="pone.0204153.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that <italic>SbCCoAOMT</italic> can be manipulated to modify cell wall composition of soluble and wall-bound phenolic compounds without significant negative impacts on plant growth and development and minimal impacts on other biochemical pathways.
