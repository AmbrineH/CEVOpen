    "Cottonseed meal (CSM) and cottonseed oil (CSO), two cottonseed products, are rich in protein and lipids, respectively, but their use is limited by antinutritional factors in the products. This study investigated the effect of different dietary levels of CSM and CSO supplementation on the laying performance and egg quality of laying hens. A total of 162 24-week-old Hy-Line brown laying hens were randomly assigned to diets supplemented with 0, 6%, or 12% CSM and 0, 2%, or 4% CSO in a 3 × 3 factorial design. During the 8-week feeding trial, laying performance and egg quality parameters were measured weekly. Furthermore, a texture profile analysis (TPA) of the egg yolks was conducted, and the fatty acid profiles and protein composition of the yolks were measured to further determine egg quality. CSM supplementation decreased (p < 0.01) egg production and feed efficiency and increased (p < 0.01) yolk color, eggshell rate, and shell thickness, but had no significant effects on the TPA parameters, fatty acid profiles, and protein components of egg yolks. CSO supplementation resulted in decreases (p < 0.01) in egg production, egg weight, and feed efficiency and an increase (p < 0.01) in yolk color. In addition, CSO supplementation with two weeks of cold storage changed the physical properties of boiled egg yolks, as indicated by increased (p < 0.01) hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness. Furthermore, 4% CSO supplementation increased the ratio of saturated/monounsaturated fatty acids (SAFA/MUFA) and the protein content of egg yolks, which was accompanied by a modified protein composition. These results indicate that CSM supplementation reduces laying performance and egg quality, and CSO supplementation decreases laying performance and results in egg yolk hardening by modifying its components."
