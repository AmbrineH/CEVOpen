    "Fucoxanthin and its major metabolite, fucoxanthinol, have potent anti-cancer properties in carcinogenic model mice and against cancer cells. Evidence has accumulated regarding the diagnostic potential of biological metabolites as invasive and non-invasive obtainable approaches. We recently demonstrated that glycine was an effective predictor of the suppression of sphere formation and epithelial mesenchymal transition by fucoxanthinol in human colorectal cancer stem-like spheroids (colonospheres) under normoxia and hypoxia. In the present study, we investigated the suppressive effect of fucoxanthin on tumorigenesis derived from colonospheres in xenograft mice, and the alteration on the metabolite profiles of mouse tumors by fucoxanthin was evaluated. Fucoxanthin administration at 2.5Â mg/kg body weight (p.o.) for 4 weeks significantly inhibited the incidence of tumors by inoculation of colonospheres suspension in BALB/c nu/nu mice compared with control mice, but not tumor sizes. In addition, fucoxanthin down-regulated tumor Cyclin D1 expression by 0.7-fold of that observed in the tumors of the control mice. Moreover, the tumor glycine level in the xenograft mice was decreased by fucoxanthin administration to 0.5-fold. These results imply the possibility of tumor metabolites as a prediction marker of tumorigenicity derived from colorectal cancer stem cells in mice."
