    "The present study assessed the ability of chitosan-based coatings incorporating savory and/or tarragon essential oils (EOs) to preserve the postharvest quality of kumquats. Changes in weight loss, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, and vitamin C content were determined over 30 days of storage at 7°C. Savory (Satureja hortensias L.) essential oil was characterized by thymol (29.1%), carvacrol (26.6%), and γ-terpinene (24.72%) as major constituents. While, in the tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus L.) essential oil, estragol (81.89%), β-cis-Ocimene (4.62%), and β-trans-Ocimene (3.44%) were the main ones. The CH-EOs coatings were effective in reducing weight loss of kumquats fruits during storage. Moreover, the tested composite coatings showed positive effects in maintaining vitamin C and fruits treated with CH-oil coatings retained good sensory acceptability. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the combined application of chitosan and savory and/or tarragon EOs as a promising postharvest treatment for maintaining the postharvest quality of kumquats fruits."
