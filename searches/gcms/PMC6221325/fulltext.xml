biological processes. Here, we describe the role of an Axin family member, PRY-1, in lipid metabolism. Axins are scaffolding proteins that play crucial roles in signal transduction pathways by physically interacting with multiple factors and coordinating the assembly of protein complexes. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of a <italic>pry-1</italic> mutant revealed differentially regulated genes that are associated with lipid metabolism such as vitellogenins (yolk lipoproteins), fatty acid desaturases, lipases, and fatty acid transporters. Consistent with these categorizations, we found that <italic>pry-1</italic> is crucial for the maintenance of lipid levels. Knockdowns of <italic>vit</italic> genes in a <italic>pry-1</italic> mutant background restored lipid levels, suggesting that vitellogenins contribute to PRY-1 function in lipid metabolic processes. Additionally, lowered expression of desaturases and lipidomic analysis provided evidence that fatty acid synthesis is reduced in <italic>pry-1</italic> mutants. Accordingly, an exogenous supply of oleic acid restored depleted lipids in somatic tissues of worms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PRY-1/Axin signaling is essential for lipid metabolism and involves the regulation of yolk proteins.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8572-7054</contrib-id><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Bhagwati P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Discovery grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to Bhagwati Gupta (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca</ext-link>).

Subsequently, Axin family members were shown to also be essential in numerous developmental events including embryogenesis, axis formation, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a scaffolding protein Axin plays a key role in the regulation of canonical WNT pathway function. It contains multiple domains that facilitate homodimerization and interactions with the destruction-complex proteins Dishevelled, APC, and GSK-3&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206540.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In turn, the destruction complex initiates the phosphorylation and consequent proteolysis of the transcriptional regulator &#x003b2;-Catenin, which promotes expression of WNT target genes [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206540.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Constitutive activation of &#x003b2;-Catenin, consequent to the loss of destruction-complex function, is often associated with cancers and various other disorders affecting the lungs, heart, muscles, and bones [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, Axin function is crucial toward ensuring precise regulation of &#x003b2;-Catenin-mediated WNT signaling. In addition to WNT pathway components, Axin homologs also interact with various other factors such as Smad3, MEKK4, and LKB1 to affect diverse processes, for example cell proliferation, metabolic homeostasis, and tissue aging [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the mechanism of Axin function in these processes is not fully understood.</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, PRY-1 is a member of the Axin family that is involved in multiple events such as cell fate specification, neuronal differentiation, and tissue formation [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Molecular genetic experiments have shown that PRY-1 interacts with APR-1/APC and GSK-3/GSK-3&#x003b2; to regulate BAR-1/&#x003b2;-Catenin-mediated gene transcription [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The phenotypes of <italic>pry-1</italic> mutants are consistent with overactivation of WNT signaling, such as Q cell migration and vulval induction [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206540.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our group has been investigating <italic>pry-1</italic> role in developmental as well as post-developmental processes. To identify genes that interact with <italic>pry-1</italic>, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome profiling experiment. Among the genes that were differentially expressed many were found to be associated with lipid metabolism. Consistent with this, <italic>pry-1</italic> mutant animals showed reduced lipid level. We examined a subset of differentially regulated genes, specifically yolk lipoproteins vitellogenins (VITs), which are important for lipid distribution [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in mediating <italic>pry-1</italic> function. Knockdowns of <italic>vit</italic> genes by RNA interference (RNAi) rescued lipid defects in <italic>pry-1</italic> mutants. We also found that the expression of three conserved stearoyl-CoA-desaturases, <italic>fat-5</italic>, <italic>fat-6</italic>, and <italic>fat-7</italic>, which are involved in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (OA) [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], was reduced in <italic>pry-1</italic> mutants. In support of this, supplementing the bacterial diet of mutant animals with OA partially rescued the lipid phenotype. These results provide evidence for the important role of PRY-1 in lipid metabolism through the regulation of vitellogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Strains</title><p>Worms were grown on standard Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar plates using procedure described previously [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Eppendorf tubes, glass vials or any containers used for the extraction process were sonicated in dichloromethane (Caledon Laboratories Ltd., Canada, Catalog number 3601-2-40) for 30 minutes to eliminate lipid contamination. To determine FA composition, we collected few thousand adult worms from three 6-cm plates and removed residual bacteria by washing the animals with sterile water. Washed worms were placed into a screw-capped centrifuge tube and spun at 2,500 RPM for 45 seconds. The residual water was removed using a Pasteur pipette and worms were transferred to glass vials (Agilent, part number 5182&#x02013;0714) and accurately weighed to 50&#x02013;100 mg. Fatty acids were then extracted from tissues and transmethylated by adding 1 ml of 2.5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (Caledon Laboratories Ltd., Canada, Catalog number 8825-1-05) diluted in methanol (Caledon Laboratories Ltd., Canada, Catalog number 6701-7-40). We spiked the samples with 10 &#x003bc;l of a recovery standard (stearic acid 120 ng/&#x003bc;l, Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Catalog number S4751-1G) and incubated at 80 &#x000b0;C for an hour in a water bath. To this, a mixture of 0.2 ml of hexane (Caledon Laboratories Ltd., Canada, Catalog number 3201-7-40) and 1.5 ml of water was added and slowly spun to extract fatty acid methyl esters into the hexane layer. Agilent 6890 series gas chromatographer equipped with a 30 &#x000d7; 0.25 mm SP-2380 fused silica capillary column (Supelco USA), helium as the carrier gas at 1.4 ml/minute, and a flame ionization detector was used for fatty acid analysis. Automatic injections of 1 &#x003bc;l samples in the organic phase were made, without splitting, into the GC inlet set to 250 &#x000b0;C. The thermal program began at 50 &#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, then increased linearly to 300 &#x000b0;C at a ramping rate of 8 &#x000b0;C/minute and held this temperature for 15 minutes. A constant flow rate of 1 ml/minute helium carrier gas under electronic pressure control was maintained for the fatty acid composition determination by TIC method using standard software. For quantitation of fatty acids, the peaks across all GC-MS runs were aligned using both chromatographic information (retention times) and mass-spectral data (m/z components) to establish the chemical identity of peaks being compared. We calculated the relative fatty acid amounts by dividing each peak area by the sum of areas for all fatty acid peaks appearing on the same chromatogram. For each fatty acid, the quantities determined by GC-MS were successively normalized in two ways: 1) to an internal standard naphthalene-d8, 10 ng/&#x003bc;l (1 ng/&#x003bc;l in injection sample) added to each sample prior to sonication and lipid extraction), and 2) to the weight of the samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistics were performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2016.

However, additional mechanisms are also likely to be involved, such as reduced conversion of acetyl-CoA to saturated fatty acid (palmitate), lower synthesis of diglycerides, and increased peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206540.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). It would therefore be worthwhile to examine these possibilities in future studies.</p><p>It is also unclear whether PRY-1 is required in one or more tissues to maintain lipid levels. In preliminary studies using <italic>pry-1</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> transgenic animals, we observed fluorescence in several tissues including seam cells, neuronal cells, muscles, and hypodermis. This suggests a broader requirement of PRY-1 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, however more experiments are needed to fully understand its tissue-specific role in lipid regulation.</p><p>Our study provides the first evidence of PRY-1/Axin function in lipid metabolism. The involvement of lipids in age-related disorders in humans, as well as animal models, is well documented. Genetic and acquired lipid diseases are associated with the loss of subcutaneous fat, accumulation of visceral and ectopic fat, and metabolic syndromes such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition, Yang et al. showed that Axin expression in mice contributes to an age-related increase in adiposity in thymic stromal cells [<xref rid="pone.0206540.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the role of PRY-1/Axin in fat storage needs to be investigated further, whether Axin family members play roles in any of these lipid-related diseases remains unknown. Therefore, the findings that PRY-1/Axin is necessary for the regulation of lipid levels provide a unique opportunity to investigate the role of Axin signaling in age-related lipid metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0206540.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Expression profile of WNT ligands, receptors, and target genes.</title><p>(A-C) Developmental expression patterns of known WNT ligands, receptors and target genes from published microarray sources (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>).

Lipid anabolic processes involve initiation, desaturation and elongation of fatty-acid (FA), followed by triglyceride (TAG) formation. Initiation involves conversion of Acetyl CoA to the saturated fatty-acid (SFA) Palmitate (C16:0). Elongase (<italic>elo</italic>) and desaturase (<italic>fat</italic>) enzymes act on Palmitate to modify it to long chain mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs and PUFAs, respectively). MUFAs and PUFAs are collectively termed as free fatty acids (FFAs). The FFAs are linked with glycerol 3-phosphate (Glycerol 3P) to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA). PA and monoglycerides (MAG) serve as building blocks of diglycerides (DAG) synthesis. DAGs are converted into neutral lipids (TAGs). Lipid catabolism begins with the breakdown of TAGs into DAGs by ATGL-1, and other lipases and lipase-like enzymes (abbreviated as &#x02018;<italic>lipl&#x02019;</italic> and &#x02018;<italic>lips&#x02019;</italic>) to release FFAs. FFAs are further broken down to Acetyl CoA through peroxisomal- and mitochondrial- &#x003b2;-oxidation and release energy.
