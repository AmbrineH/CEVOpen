This study aims at tackling the components involved in the flavored hookah tobacco from a chemical and biological point of view. Detecting individual flavor compounds, within a complex hookah tobacco matrix was accomplished using headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME). A total of 114 volatiles were identified in 13 flavored hookah tobacco products, with esters amounting for the major component up to 40%. Whereas oxygenated monoterpenes presented another major volatile class, contributing up to 23%, including (<italic>E</italic>)-anethole. Superheating flavored hookah tobacco at 190&#x02009;&#x000b0;C resulted in the release of a mixture of phenol derivatives and polycyclic aromatic compounds that are indicative of coal tar, a major component produced during hookah tobacco usage with potential health hazards. This study provides the first comprehensive volatile profile of hookah tobacco products from different origins identifying chemical components involved in flavors. It is expected to serve as informative grounds for the better understanding of hookah tobacco production and usage. The information presented is also expected to raise awareness on the health risks of hookah tobacco smoking.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tobacco cigarette smoking is known for its adverse health effects including cancer, pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Tobacco smoke comprises a large number of chemicals and brand-specific flavors, which contribute hundreds of volatiles, makes it a highly complex mixture. Many of these chemicals have been identified and characterized as toxins and/or carcinogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The increasing awareness of cigarette tobacco smoking health hazards has been shown to be one of the factors that led to a decrease in its consumption in 140 countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. From 2000 to 2011, although per capita cigarette consumption decreased by 40.7%, non-cigarette combustible products consumption increased by 96.9%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Among these non-cigarette combustible products is hookah (<italic>aka</italic>, waterpipe, shisha or narghile) tobacco, which its usage among the youth is on the rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the United States, 18% of high school seniors reported hookah tobacco usage at least once a year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The mechanism of hookah tobacco smoking is unique. First, the tobacco is heated indirectly with charcoal, then the smoke passes through a water bowl and finally is inhaled by the smoker through a rubber hose fitted with a mouthpiece<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Hookah tobacco products come in different flavors, such as apple, mint, cherry, chocolate, coconut, licorice, cappuccino, and watermelon. Despite that hookah tobacco usage shares the same safety concerns as cigarettes, a misconception exists that it is safer and less addictive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. One of the major reasons for the popularity of hookah tobacco is its presentation in various pleasant flavors with distinct attractive aromas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Food flavor additives are regulated and monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any possible adverse effects on humans. In the same context, hookah tobacco flavors profiling is vital for its quality control and safety measures. Recently, the FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for regulating e-cigarettes, cigars, waterpipe tobacco, dissolvable tobacco, nicotine gels and all other products made or derived from tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Previous studies have focused on studying the smoke exposure through hookah tobacco in comparison with cigarettes, and identifying the chemical constituents of hookah tobacco, but very limited research has been conducted on flavored hookah tobacco products and their chemical analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The fact that these flavors are appealing to adolescents worldwide and are regarded as &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; seem to be the most conceivable reason for hookah tobacco consumption, and poses a very crucial target for investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we aim to provide answers for the underlying question: What is in your flavored hookah tobacco? (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We employed the technique of headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for volatiles profiling in 11 different flavored hookah tobacco products namely, apple, green grape, guava, melon, watermelon, strawberry, cinnamon, mango, peach, and unflavored &#x0201c;Kas&#x0201d; from different manufacturers, in addition to tobacco cigarette. These flavors were selected based on their wide availability and popularity as recommended by suppliers. To our knowledge, this study presents the first attempt to characterize aroma of the various commercial hookah tobacco flavors. For different flavors classification, multivariate data analyses were applied for the identification of unique chemicals contributing to the flavor of each hookah tobacco type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Melon and apple flavored hookah tobacco products were analyzed from both manufacturers to assess how origin affected hookah flavor volatile profile to amount to a total of 13 hookah tobacco products Rothmans tobacco cigarettes were also used in the analyzes as a control for comparison purposes.</p><p id="Par42">SPME fibres of stableflex coated with divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS, 50/30&#x02009;&#x000b5;m) or PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) were purchased by Supelco (Oakville, ON, Canada).

For hookah flavor volatiles collection, 0.5&#x02009;g of hookah tobacco material was placed inside SPME screw cap vials (20&#x02009;ml) followed by the addition of 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of <italic>(Z)</italic>-3-hexenyl acetate prepared in water as an internal standard.

The fiber was subsequently withdrawn into the needle and then injected into the injection port of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatogram equipped with DB-5 column (30&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.25&#x02009;mm i.d.&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.25&#x02009;<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m film thickness; Supelco) and coupled to Shimadzu QP5050A mass spectrometer. The interface and the injector temperatures were both set at 220&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The following gradient temperature program was used for volatiles analysis. The oven temperature was kept first at 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;min, then increased to 180&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at a rate of 12&#x02009;&#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, kept at 180&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min, and finally ramped at a rate of 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 240&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and kept at this temperature for 5&#x02009;min. The carrier gas Helium was used at a total flow rate of 0.9&#x02009;ml/min. Blank runs were made during samples analyzes using only charcoal. The HP quadruple mass spectrometer was operated in EI mode at 70&#x02009;eV. A scan range was set at the ratio of mass to charge number of ions (<italic>m/z)</italic> 40&#x02013;500. For heated hookah flavor volatiles collection, 0.5&#x02009;g of hookah material was mixed with 0.5&#x02009;g heated charcoal inside SPME screw cap vials (20&#x02009;ml) placed on a hot plate kept at 190&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;minutes followed by the addition of 2&#x02009;ml distilled water.

Matching library spectra above a threshold of 90% with regard to MS1 and MS/MS level was considered acceptable. Peaks were first deconvoluted using AMDIS software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.amdis.net">www.amdis.net</ext-link>) prior to mass spectral matching. Volatiles abundance data were prepared for multivariate data analysis by extraction using MET-IDEA software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> for data extraction. Data were then subjected to principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) using SIMCA-P version 13.0 software package (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). Markers were subsequently identified by analysing the S-plot, which was declared with covariance (p) and correlation (pcor). All variables were mean centred and scaled to Pareto variance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec37"><p>
