    "Valeriana jatamansi Jones is an aromatic medicinal herb and important alternative to V. officinalis, which is utilized for medicinal purposes in China and India and also as spices in India. Bioactive ingredients of V. jatamansi vary in different regions. However, no information is currently available on influence of genotype and environmental factors in the volatile compounds, especially when germplasms and planting locations need to be selected. Based on the results of SNP and volatile constituents from GC-MS analysis, this study found various genotypes and chemotypes of V. jatamansi for wild plants from seven regions in China and common-garden samples; correlations between genotype and chemotype were revealed for the plants. Two distinct populations (PX, FY) were distinguishable from five others (GJ, YL, SY, DD, DY) according to their genotypes and volatile profiles, the consistency of which was observed showing that genotype could significantly influence chemotype. Wild populations and common-garden samples were also separated in their volatile profiles, demonstrating that environmental factors strongly affected their chemotypes. Compounds contributing to the discrimination were identified as discriminatory compounds. This investigation has explored and provided essential information concerning the correlation between genotype and chemotype as well as environmental factors and chemotype of V. jatamansi in some regions of China. Feasible plantation and conservation strategies of V. jatamansi could be further explored based on these results."
