    "Certain volatile thiols are some of the most potent odour-active molecules that are found in nature. Thiols play significant roles in the aroma qualities of a range of foods and beverages, including wine, with extremely low odour detection thresholds (nanogram per litre range). A fundamental understanding of their formation, fate, and impact essentially depends on the development of suitable analytical methods. The analysis of volatile thiols in foods and beverages is a challenging task when considering (1) the complexity of food and beverage matrices and (2) that thiols are highly reactive, low molecular-weight volatiles that are generally present at trace to ultra-trace concentrations. For the past three decades, the analytical evaluation of volatile thiols has been intensively performed in various foods and beverages, and many novel techniques related to derivatisation, isolation, separation, and detection have been developed, particularly by wine researchers. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the major analytical methodologies that are proposed for potent volatile thiol analysis in wine, foods, and other beverages. The analytical challenges for thiol analysis in foods and beverages are outlined, and the main analytical methods and recent advances in methodology are summarised and evaluated for their strengths and limitations. The key analytical aspects reviewed include derivatisation and sample preparation techniques, chromatographic separation, mass spectrometric detection, matrix effects, and quantitative analysis. In addition, future perspectives on volatile thiol research are also suggested."
