Most of the current supplements of DHA, including fish oil and krill oil, do not significantly increase brain DHA, because they are hydrolyzed to free DHA and are absorbed as triacylglycerol, whereas the transporter at blood brain barrier is specific for phospholipid form of DHA. Here we show that oral administration of DHA to normal adult mice as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (40&#x02009;mg DHA/kg) for 30 days increased DHA content of the brain by &#x0003e;2-fold. In contrast, the same amount of free DHA did not increase brain DHA, but increased the DHA in adipose tissue and heart. Moreover, LPC-DHA treatment markedly improved the spatial learning and memory, as measured by Morris water maze test, whereas free DHA had no effect. The brain derived neurotrophic factor increased in all brain regions with LPC-DHA, but not with free DHA. These studies show that dietary LPC-DHA efficiently increases brain DHA content and improves brain function in adult mammals, thus providing a novel nutraceutical approach for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases associated with DHA deficiency, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential omega 3 fatty acid, is uniquely concentrated in the brain, nervous tissues and retina, and is essential for the normal neurological development and function. The deficiency of DHA is associated with several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s, Parkinson&#x02019;s, schizophrenia, and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Unlike liver, the brain cannot efficiently convert dietary alpha linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) to DHA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and is almost completely dependent upon the uptake of preformed DHA from the plasma. However, dietary supplementation with the currently available preparations of DHA such as fish or krill oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, algal DHA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, DHA-enriched egg phospholipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> ethyl esters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and sardines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> does not appreciably increase brain DHA levels in adult mammals, although peripheral tissues are enriched with DHA under the same conditions. One possible explanation for this is that DHA from the above supplements is hydrolyzed to free DHA by the pancreatic enzymes and absorbed as triacylglycerol (TAG) in chylomicrons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), whereas the brain uniquely takes up DHA in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The recent demonstration of a transporter at the blood brain barrier (Mfsd2a), which specifically transports LPC-DHA, but not free DHA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, further supports this mechanism. It is therefore necessary to increase the levels of LPC-DHA in plasma for an efficient enrichment of brain DHA. We propose that if dietary DHA is provided in the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC) or in the form of LPC in the diet, it should escape the hydrolysis by pancreatic PLA<sub>2</sub>, and will be absorbed as PC-DHA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The PC-DHA is more likely to be taken up by the brain after conversion to LPC-DHA in plasma or liver by the phospholipases, compared to TAG-DHA, which requires extensive metabolic transformations in the liver in order to form LPC-DHA. We have recently demonstrated in lymph fistula rats, that the amount of DHA that is absorbed in the form of phospholipid can indeed be increased by up to 5-fold by providing the DHA in the form of LPC, relative to free DHA, a surrogate for the currently used dietary supplements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We also found that the incorporation of DHA into intestine-derived HDL is increased 2- fold during the absorption of LPC-DHA, compared to the absorption of free DHA. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increasing DHA absorption in the phospholipid form not only increases brain DHA levels but also improves cognition and memory in normal adult mice. We compared the incorporation of dietary free DHA and LPC-DHA into the brain and other tissues, following daily gavage of the compounds in a corn oil vehicle for 30 days. Since it has been suggested that the presence of DHA at sn-2 position of LPC is important for efficient brain uptake and accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we have also compared the absorption and brain uptake of the two positional isomers of LPC-DHA (sn-1 DHA LPC and sn-2 DHA LPC). The results show that the DHA content of most regions of the brain is more than doubled by feeding either sn-1 or sn-2 DHA LPC, but not by feeding free DHA, which however enriched other tissues. Furthermore, the mice treated with both LPC-DHA isomers showed a remarkable enhancement of spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze test. These studies are the first to demonstrate a targeted enrichment of brain DHA through diet leading to a functional improvement in memory in normal adult mice. If confirmed in humans, these studies have the potential to lead to novel nutraceutical approaches for the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders associated with low cerebral DHA levels, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s, Parkinson&#x02019;s, schizophrenia, and depression.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Proposed hypothesis. When dietary DHA is present in TAG (for example, fish oil) or in sn-2 position of PC (for example, krill oil), it is released as free fatty acid and absorbed as TAG in the chylomicrons. On the other hand, if DHA is provided in sn-1 position of PC, or as LPC, it will be absorbed as PC in chylomicrons and HDL. The PC-DHA is more likely to be transported into brain after conversion to LPC, compared to TAG-DHA, since the brain preferentially takes up DHA as LPC.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_11766_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e314"/></fig>

The food intake, and the body weights were not significantly different between the 4 groups of mice. Following the cognitive tests (see below), the mice were sacrificed and the fatty acid composition of various tissues was analyzed by GC/MS.

In addition to DHA, the percentages of arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4) are shown, since DHA has been reported to replace predominantly ARA in most tissues, and since the 22:6/20:4 ratio provides one measure of the anti-inflammatory potential in the tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

However, there was also an increase in the percentage of 20:4 with all three DHA preparations, resulting in no significant change in the ratio of 22:6/20:4. The reason for the increase in plasma ARA is not clear, although it is decreased in most tissues where DHA is increased (see below). One possible explanation is that the tissue ARA replaced by DHA is released as free ARA into the plasma. The concentration of LPC DHA in plasma was also determined by LC/MS/MS. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the LPC DHA concentration of plasma increased significantly in mice treated with either isomer of LPC DHA, but not in mice treated with free DHA.

The proposed intestinal barrier is essentially the pancreatic enzymes, which release DHA from the dietary supplements in the form of free (unesterified) acid, which is then incorporated predominantly into chylomicron TAG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), whereas the blood brain barrier requires the DHA to be in lysophospholipid form for efficient enrichment of the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that if we can increase the absorption of DHA in the form of phospholipid, it is more likely to enrich the brain DHA and improve brain function. For this purpose, we compared dietary free DHA which is a surrogate for TAG-DHA (ex; fish oil, algal oil), as well as for the natural phospholipid-DHA (ex: krill oil), and which is absorbed as TAG, with dietary LPC-DHA, which is absorbed as PC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, with respect to the enrichment of brain DHA.</p><p id="Par13">The results presented here show that the brain DHA levels can be increased by &#x0003e;2-fold in the normal adult mice by feeding either sn-1 DHA LPC or sn-2 DHA LPC, whereas treatment with an equal amount of free DHA did not appreciably increase the brain DHA levels. Although previous studies suggested that the sn-2 DHA LPC may be preferred over the sn-1 isomer for uptake by the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> we did not find significant differences between the two isomers when administered orally. Furthermore, the increase in brain DHA by the two LPC isomers resulted in similar increases in BDNF levels, and a striking but similar improvement in spatial memory, as measured by Morris water maze test. One possible explanation for this is that the sn-2 DHA LPC is rapidly isomerized to the sn-1 isomer, and therefore the differences between the isomers is abolished. However, our recent studies show that unlike sn-2 16:0 LPC, the isomerization of sn-2 22:6 LPC is much slower even at physiological pH and temperature (Sugasini and Subbaiah, unpublished results). Therefore, the lack of differential uptake is not due to the isomerization of the sn-2 DHA LPC. It should also be pointed out that regardless of the LPC isomer used, the majority of the brain DHA was present in PE rather than in PC (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), suggesting that the DHA is released from LPC after its uptake, and reincorporated into membrane lipids of the brain.</p><p id="Par14">The differential incorporation of free DHA and LPC DHA into the brain is not due to a difference in the amounts absorbed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but apparently due to dissimilar metabolic fates after absorption. Thus the free DHA, which is absorbed predominantly as TAG in the chylomicrons, was incorporated significantly into adipose tissue and the heart, but did not accumulate in the brain. On the other hand, LPC DHA, which is absorbed in phospholipid form to a greater extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, increased brain DHA levels, but had no effect on the adipose tissue DHA. In the liver, only the sn-2 DHA LPC increased the DHA concentration, whereas in the heart, all three preparations increased the DHA. It is known that chylomicrons, which have a very short half life in the circulation (&#x0003c;30&#x02009;min), pass through the heart, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle before reaching the liver as remnants, and it is therefore likely that DHA from the absorbed TAG is largely picked up by these tissues. In fact previous studies showed that there is a preferential channeling of fatty acids derived from chylomicron TAG into adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In contrast, the DHA incorporated into phospholipids remains in the circulation much longer, because the chylomicron phospholipids are rapidly transferred to the HDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which have a longer half-life of 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In addition, a significant fraction of dietary LPC-DHA is incorporated directly into intestinal HDL, mainly as phospholipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It should also be pointed out that the HDL phospholipids are the preferred substrates for three different enzymes in the plasma, namely lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, hepatic lipase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and endothelial lipase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, all of which are known to generate LPC-DHA, the preferred carrier of DHA into brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">The nature of the molecular carrier of DHA into the brain has been a matter of contention. Thus whereas Lagarde and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reported that LPC-DHA is the preferred carrier of DHA through the blood brain barrier, the recent kinetic studies of Chen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> concluded that free DHA is the major source of brain DHA, and that LPC DHA is only a minor contributor. The latter authors further suggested that there is no net increase in the DHA content of adult brain from either free DHA or LPC DHA of plasma. However, our results clearly show a net increase in brain DHA by dietary LPC DHA in the adult mice. Furthermore, this increase is accompanied by a marked increase in spatial learning and memory. Thus, we found a 7-fold decrease in the latency to previous platform area, and 2-fold increase in the time spent in the target quadrant by the LPC DHA treatment, compared to the control or free DHA treated animals.</p><p id="Par16">One possible reason for the improved brain function is the increased levels of BDNF, which is known to play a critical role in learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We found a significant increase in the BDNF levels after LPC-DHA treatment but not after free DHA treatment, thus showing a positive correlation of biochemical measurements with physiologic changes. The exact mechanism by which increases in brain DHA through LPC DHA leads to increase in BDNF levels is not clear. It is unlikely to be a direct effect of intact LPC DHA, since most of the brain DHA was present in PC and PE and only a small percentage was in LPC (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). It is more likely that free DHA released from membrane phospholipids not only acts as a precursor for various bioactive docosanoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, but also modulates BDNF transcription. It has been shown that DHA increases BDNF synthesis through activation of CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. DHA is also proposed to increase the transcription of BDNF by inhibiting hypermethylation of the promoter region of BDNF gene, which represses BDNF transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Another possible mechanism is that since BDNF levels are negatively correlated with oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and since DHA is known to induce anti-oxidant enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, the BDNF increase is a consequence of the induction of anti-oxidant enzymes which decrease the oxidative stress. A collateral benefit of delivering DHA to the brain in the form of LPC is that for each molecule of DHA entering the brain, a molecule of choline, an essential component of acetylcholine and of membrane lipids, is also delivered through the specific high affinity Mfsd2a transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. It is also possible that the free choline released from LPC hydrolysis contributes to the increase in BDNF, since previous studies showed that choline up-regulates BDNF, and down regulates its receptor TrkB (tropomyosin receptor kinase B), in cultured rat cortical cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. An alternative explanation for the higher BDNF levels is that the DHA enrichment results in increased intracellular storage of BDNF, due to its decreased release. Although we cannot rule out this possibility at present, the improvement in memory by LPC-DHA suggests an increase in functionally active BDNF.</p><p id="Par17">A previous study, in which female rats were fed DHA-enriched egg LPC of unknown composition, showed that the pups derived from these animals had increased DHA levels in some brain regions, and exhibited improved operant learning ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, indicating increased passage of DHA through the placenta. However, the brain DHA levels of the mothers were not measured in this study. The present studies demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of increasing the net concentration of DHA in the adult brain through diet. These results therefore have the potential to provide cognitive benefits for adult mammals due to the increases in brain DHA and BDNF. Although these results need to be confirmed in humans, the present observations could lead to novel nutraceutical approach for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s, Parkinson&#x02019;s, traumatic brain injury, and depression, all of which are known to be benefited by DHA enrichment of the brain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par18">Male C57BL/6 mice (age 16 weeks) were purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine).
