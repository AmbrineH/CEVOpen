However, SMAC-mimetic treatment releases also survivin from XIAP and thereby induces mitochondrial fragmentation, prevents ROS accumulation and leads to the Warburg effect, an unwanted side effect of this therapy. Importantly, cells that drift into a highly glycolytic state due to SMAC-mimetic treatment become also highly sensitive to non-genotoxic treatment with glycolysis inhibitors such as 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: A combinational therapy of non-genotoxic SMAC-mimetics and glycolysis-inhibitors overcomes IAP-mediated cell survival in cancer and provides therefore an attractive usage of SMAC-mimetics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BIRC4/XIAP</kwd><kwd>BIRC5/survivin</kwd><kwd>Warburg</kwd><kwd>SMAC-mimetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) act as key regulators in apoptosis by directly or indirectly affecting cell death signaling. BIRC5/survivin is the smallest IAP member and its main functions are the regulation of cell division, the inhibition of cell death and its involvement in DNA-double-strand repair <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Survivin is highly expressed in many different tumor types and its elevated expression correlates with enhanced chemotherapy resistance. This is especially true for high-stage, aggressive, neuroblastoma where overexpression of survivin is frequently caused by a gain of chromosome 17q, suggesting that this protein represents a promising therapeutic target in malignant cells derived from neuronal precursors <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. However, several attempts to neutralize or lower survivin by systemic administration of drugs have demonstrated severe side effects in patients <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> or failed due to lack of specificity <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Therefore, systemic targeting and neutralization of survivin might not be the strategy of choice, especially not for the treatment of young pediatric patients. Interestingly, survivin interacts with the cancer-related IAP BIRC4/XIAP, which increases the half-life of both proteins and thereby may contribute to the anti-apoptotic function of survivin <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and XIAP. However, in presence of XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1), which activates the XIAP E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, the survivin-XIAP interaction may also lead to the degradation of survivin. Therefore, depending on cell type-specific co-factors, XIAP can contribute to either survivin stabilization or to its proteasomal degradation <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. XIAP is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and mediates resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in specific subgroups of patients (reviewed in <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). To overcome XIAP-mediated cell death inhibition, several small molecules derived from the N-terminal peptide sequence of the XIAP-interacting protein Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC/Diablo) have been developed. The N-terminal peptide sequence of SMAC binds to the BIR3-domain of XIAP with a KD of 244 nM <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, whereas the interaction between SMAC and Survivin-BIR domain is 500fold lower at a KD of 121 &#x000b5;M <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, suggesting that SMAC-derived peptidomimetics (SMAC-mimetics) optimized for XIAP-BIR3-binding at KDs in the low nM range show no high affinity to survivin. SMAC-mimetic binding to XIAP releases sequestered caspase 9 (CASP9) and thereby should facilitate cell death. However, due to the similarity of XIAP-, cIAP1-and cIAP2-BIR3 domains, also cIAP1/2 are efficiently targeted, which induces their proteasomal degradation and TNF-mediated cell death in cancer cells <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Several of these compounds are currently tested in clinical trials <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In childhood neuroblastoma, SMAC-mimetics significantly affect tumor growth and death resistance of cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Although SMAC-mimetics have been evaluated for several years now, their safe application in clinic is still under debate and a reliable biomarker for patient selection and therapy monitoring is still missing (reviewed in <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Survivin, the smallest member of the IAP family contains a BIR domain, but lacks all other domains found in IAP proteins, has an indispensable function in cell division and in cell death regulation (reviewed in <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is well established that survivin, Aurora B, Borealin and INCENP form the so called chromosomal passenger complex that controls spindle assembly and chromosomal segregation during cell division (reviewed in <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). On the other hand, Survivin via XIAP interaction may promote metastasis <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and protect against cell death <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In recent publications, we demonstrated that survivin is a critical regulator of chemo-resistance and cellular metabolism that changes mitochondrial structure and activity and shifts neuroblastoma cells into a chemo-resistant, highly glycolytic state <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. This in turn renders these cells highly sensitive to treatment with glycolysis-inhibitors <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. We now discovered that XIAP sequesters significant amounts of cellular survivin in neuroblastoma cells. Neutralization of XIAP for chemotherapy-sensitization by SMAC-mimetics displaces survivin and causes the above phenomenon of a survivin-induced &#x0201c;Warburg effect&#x0201d; - i.e. increase of glycolytic activity and the shutdown of ROS-producing respiratory complexes. Our results therefore uncovered a dark-side of SMAC-mimetics, i.e they increase the resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents upstream of XIAP rather than sensitizing for them. By co-administration of glycolysis-inhibitors which antagonize survivin expression, we were able to overcome IAP-mediated cell survival and to induce cell death in a variety of cancer cells. Therefore, the combination of these two non-genotoxic substances offers an interesting therapeutic window in the treatment of malignancies with deregulated IAPs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines, culture conditions, and reagents</title><p>The neuroblastoma lines SH-EP, STA-NB15, LAN-1, as well as the colon carcinoma cell line LoVo, the leukemia cell line CEM-C7H2 and Phoenix<sup>TM</sup> packaging cells <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> were cultured in RPMI1640 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).

Survivin-induced mitochondrial fission does not result in apoptosis but in a metabolic shift to glycolysis and downregulation of the respiratory complexes I, II and IV <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Since survivin stability is in part regulated by interaction with XIAP, we wondered whether treatment with XIAP-inhibitory substances (SMAC-mimetics) also affects mitochondrial morphology and metabolism. Therefore, we treated SH-EP/Ctr and SH-EP/Surv cells for 24 hours with the already clinically tested SMAC-mimetics LCL161, TL32711/birinapant (bivalent), AT-406, and CUDC-427/GDC-0917 and monitored mitochondrial morphology by live-cell fluorescence microscopy. To ensure that mitochondrial structures were not affected by cell death, we chose a non-toxic concentration, as verified by PI-FACS analyses over a time period of 48 hours (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>A and S1B</bold>). As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>A</bold>, SMAC-mimetics lead to fragmentation of the mitochondrial networks within 24 hours in SH-EP/ Ctr cells comparable to mitochondrial structures in cells with ectopic survivin expression (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D</bold>). This effect seems so be concentration and time-dependent, since also 100 to 1000 times lower concentrations increase the amount of mitochondrial fragmentation when applied for 72 hours (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>C and S1D</bold>). To further prove that this effect depends on survivin and DRP1 recruitment, we tested the effect of LCL161 and TL32711 on mitochondria in survivin or DRP1 knock-down cells. In these cells SMAC-mimetics failed to induce mitochondrial fragmentation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, 1D and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>B</bold>). Besides protein knock-down also the chemical reduction of survivin by the transcription-inhibitory compound YM155 reverted the effect of LCL161 on mitochondrial structures (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>C</bold>), providing a functional link between survivin expression levels and the effect of SMAC-mimetics on mitochondrial morphology. Also the knock-down of XIAP itself (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>D</bold>) leads to fragmentation of mitochondria (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E</bold>) suggesting that disruption of the XIAP/survivin complex is essential for survivin's function at the mitochondria.</p><sec><title>SMAC-mimetics release survivin from XIAP</title><p>Since SMAC-mimetics were designed to specifically induce degradation of those IAP family members that contain a BIR3 domain, we tested the effect of those compounds on the protein levels of XIAP, cIAP1/2 and survivin. As demonstrated in the immunoblot in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A</bold>, cIAP1 and XIAP levels continuously decrease, whereas survivin which lacks a BIR3 domain, remains constant or even slightly increases at 20 &#x000b5;M treatments with SMAC-mimetics. For cIAP2 we detected only a transient decline, since its expression levels increased after 4 hours LCL161 treatment and already after 2 hours TL32711 treatment, although others have described a permanent loss of cIAP2 at similar <italic>in vitro</italic> concentrations <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. To further test our hypothesis that mitochondrial fragmentation seen in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> results from the disruption of XIAP/survivin complexes and from released survivin, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments for survivin and XIAP after LCL161 and TL32711 treatment. Both SMAC-mimetics reduced the amount of XIAP bound to survivin within two hours treatment in SH-EP/Ctr and in SH-EP/Surv cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, upper panels</bold>) and <italic>vice versa,</italic> less survivin was bound to XIAP after SMAC-mimetic treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C lower panels</bold>). Of note, SMAC-mimetic-treatment reduced XIAP-steady state levels which might also contribute to the release of survivin.</p><p>The release of survivin from XIAP/survivin complexes further caused translocation of DRP1 from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and reduction of DRP1 phosphorylation at Ser637 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>E</bold>). The results of subcellular fractionation were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, where in SMAC-mimetic treated cells DRP1-staining strongly co-localized with CMXRos-stained mitochondria (<bold>Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>F and S2G</bold>). This was in line with the observed mitochondrial fragmentation in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>B</bold> where DRP1 knock-down prevents mitochondrial fragmentation and with previous results that high survivin expression leads to increased mitochondria-associated DRP1<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Additionally, LCL161 and TL32711 treatment reduced the expression of respiratory complexes I, II, and IV in SH-EP/Ctr cells, but not in SH-EP/shSurv cells, which is again reflecting the high-survivin-expressing phenotype as published before <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Since we have seen before that survivin shuts down respiration and leads to dependency on aerobic glycolysis, we tested whether mitochondrial fragmentation by SMAC-mimetics also affects cellular metabolism. Therefore we monitored the glucose amount and the lactate release into the media of SH-EP/Ctr and SH-EP/shSurv cells after treatment with LCL161 (5 &#x000b5;M) and TL32711 (3 &#x000b5;M) for 72 hours. In SH-EP/Ctr cells expressing endogenous levels of survivin, LCL161 and TL32711 cause an increase in glucose consumption and simultaneously an increased lactate release into the media. In SH-EP/ shSurv cells, however, no significant changes in glucose consumption or lactate production were visible (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D</bold>). Our results were further supported by GC/MS-based quantitation of intracellular levels of metabolites belonging to glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways. As shown in <bold>Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref></bold>, treatment for 72 hours with LCL161 (5 &#x000b5;M) reduces the amount of glucose, citrate, succinate, fumarate, and malate comparable to ectopic survivin expression and suggest that treatment with LCL161 preferentially induces the direct conversion of pyruvate into lactate instead of generating TCA cycle metabolites. To finally test whether SMAC-mimetics affect oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), we measured mitochondrial respiration after LCL161 treatment (5 &#x000b5;M, 72 hours). As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E</bold>, treatment with LCL161 significantly reduced oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in SH-EP/Ctr cells to less than 80% compared to untreated controls. As a control, we also measured OCR in SH-EP/Surv cells, which only possessed about 40% mitochondrial respiration ability compared to SH-EP/Ctr cells. This further strengthens our hypothesis, that survivin, released from XIAP is sufficient to induce mitochondrial morphology changes, which affect cellular metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction of respiratory complexes hinders ROS production</title><p>The shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis reduces the amount of ROS which are produced during the electron transfer within the respiratory chain. Since the reduction of complex I, II and IV and the increase in glycolysis suggest an effective shift away from respiration, we tested the ability of LCL161- or TL32711-treated cells to produce ROS. We therefore chose a PKB-independent 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) inducible FOXO3(A3)ER construct, which was already shown to affect mitochondrial respiration and ROS generation <italic>via</italic> BCL2L11/Bim induction <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. To investigate the effect of SMAC-mimetics on ROS production we pre-treated SH-EP/FOXO3-Ctr, SH- EP/FOXO3-shSurv or SH-EP/FOXO3-Surv cells with 10 &#x000b5;M LCL161 or TL32711 for 20 hours to induce mitochondrial changes before we added 100 nM 4OHT for another 4 hours. Activation of FOXO3 by 4OHT leads to a strong accumulation of mitochondrial ROS as visualized by MitoTracker Red staining. This ROS burst was efficiently reduced when the cells were pre-incubated with the SMAC-mimetics (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, upper panel</bold>) although Bim was still induced within these cells (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref>A</bold>). As described before, mitochondrial ROS- accumulation by FOXO3 contributes to apoptosis induction - the pre-treatment with LCL161 or TL32711 significantly reduced apoptosis after ectopic FOXO3 activation (<bold>Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref>B</bold>). In survivin knock-down cells, however, neither LCL161 nor TL32711 were able to reduce ROS levels significantly (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, middle</bold>). In cells ectopically expressing survivin, no ROS accumulation was detectable independent of SMAC-mimetic treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, lower panel</bold>).</p><p>The ROS-inhibiting function of LCL161 and TL32711 was also visible when the cells were treated with the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics etoposide and doxorubicin: both drugs failed to induce mitochondrial ROS when the cells were pre-treated with the SMAC-mimetics (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B</bold>). This interesting finding uncovers a &#x0201c;dark-side&#x0201d; of SMAC-mimetics in cancer therapy and might explain the failure of phase I and phase II studies on SMAC-mimetic administration over the past years (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; NCT02147873 and <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The metabolic shift induced by SMAC-mimetics sensitizes cancer cells to non-toxic glycolysis inhibition</title><p>Our results suggest that SMAC-mimetics displace survivin from XIAP, which leads to DRP1 recruitment to mitochondria, mitochondrial fragmentation, respiration reduction and an increase in glycolysis. Since we demonstrated before that highly glycolytic tumors with increased survivin levels can be efficiently targeted by glycolysis- inhibition <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, we now tested, whether the observed changes in metabolism induced by SMAC-mimetics are sufficient to sensitize cells for glycolysis inhibition. We therefore pre-treated SH-EP/Ctr, SH-EP/Surv and SH-EP/shSurv cells for 12 hours with LCL161 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A</bold>, 10 &#x000b5;M) or TL32711 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B</bold>, 12 &#x000b5;M) before we added 5 mM 2DG for another 24 hours. After treatment cell viability was analyzed by resazurin reduction. As demonstrated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A</bold> and B, 2DG-treatment alone hat only a minor effect by reducing cell viability to 80-90% compared to untreated controls. Co-administration of LCL161 or TL32711, however, significantly reduced viability below 50%. In SH-EP/Surv cells, which are mainly glycolytic, 2DG-treatment alone reduced viability below 30% and SMAC-mimetics had no additional sensitizing effect. In SH-EP/shSurv cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, right panel</bold>) both SMAC-mimetics failed to reduce viability after 2DG-treatment, suggesting again that survivin levels are critical for shifting cells into glycolysis. As a control, we also lowered survivin levels by addition of YM155, a compound that inhibits survivin and was recently shown to also enhance degradation of survivin <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. When cells were treated with 5 nM YM155 and LCL161, LCL161 failed to sensitize these cells for 2DG-treatment (<bold>Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref></bold>), demonstrating again, that unbound survivin is necessary for shifting cells towards glycolysis.</p><p>To further explore the specificity of the observed sensitization to 2DG by co-treatment with SMAC- mimetics, we analyzed the effect of LCL161 on two other neuroblastoma cell lines which do not carry an 17q amplification, but are derived from biopsies of patients with stage M (old classification stage 4 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and further differ in the N-MYC status <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. Also in these two neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y and LAN-1) LCL161 treatment significantly reduced mitochondrial connectivity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C</bold>) and LCL161 or TL32711 pre-treatment sensitized these cells to 2DG (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D</bold>). This effect was not only restricted to neuroblastoma cells, but also observed in the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line LoVo or in the leukemia cell line CEM-C7H2 (5C/D). As shown in Supplemental <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>C</bold>, within these cell lines we observed a moderate survivin/XIAP ratio, suggesting that not only absolute surviving or XIAP expression levels, but the ratio between XIAP and survivin is critical for the metabolic phenotype. Cell lines with amplified chromosome 17q (STA-NB15) or ectopic expression of surviving (SH-EP/Surv) possess an increased survivin/XIAP ratio and are <italic>per se</italic> highly glycolytic <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. In contrast, in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line NxS2 which already has an largely fragmented mitochondrial phenotype, SMAC-mimetics hat no sensitizing effect to 2DG treatment, but these cells already showed reduced viability after 2DG single treatment comparable to SH-EP/Surv cells (<bold>Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>A and S6B</bold>).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the observed reduction in cell viability by co-administration of SMAC-mimetics and 2DG is also relevant under physiological conditions with glucose <italic>ad libitium.</italic> We injected LAN-1 cells which were shown to be tumorigenic in mice <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, into the flanks of Balb c nu/nu mice to study the effects of combined SMAC-mimetic / 2DG therapy <italic>in vivo</italic> on highly malignant neuroblastoma tumors. After tumors were palpable (approximately 50 mm<sup>3</sup>), the mice were randomly divided into four groups and treated three times a week for three weeks: one group was treated i.p. with 5 mg 2DG, the second group received 4 mg/kg LCL161, the third group a combination of both and the control group was treated with carrier only. Tumor volume (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A</bold> and representative pictures in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C</bold>) and tumor weight (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B</bold>) was significantly reduced in LAN-1-derived tumors treated with LCL161 and 2DG after 3 weeks, whereas neither LCL161 alone nor 2DG alone reduced tumor growth. Except for one tumor, all LAN-1 derived tumors remained smaller than 100 mm<sup>3</sup>. This suggests that the combinational therapy of LCL161 and 2DG is a highly effective treatment option for neuroblastoma and potentially other tumors, even if the tumor cells express only moderate levels of survivin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Apart from resistance against chemotherapeutic agents and relapsed tumors, the risk of secondary malignancies caused by initial chemotherapy is especially high for children facing extensive chemotherapy <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Therefore, cancer specific, non-genotoxic and patient oriented &#x0201c;precision medicine&#x0201d; have come into the focus of targeting cancers during the last years <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. One class of these cancer specific agents which have entered preclinical studies are so called SMAC-mimetics which are designed to inhibit the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein members BIRC2/ cIAP1, BIRC3/cIAP2 and BIRC4/XIAP <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. These agents are currently used as mono-, and even more effective, in combination-therapy to override cell-death inhibitory signaling. Although these substances are now tested for several years, there is still debate about their efficacy, their interplay with several pathways and their activity in preclinical studies <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. We previously identified another IAP member, BIRC5/survivin as critical factor in shifting mitochondrial energy production from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis by regulating mitochondrial connectivity in high-stage neuroblastoma <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Since survivin shares a BIR-domain with the other IAP members and is thought to be stabilized by XIAP <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, we tested whether SMAC-mimetics might also affect the mitochondrial morphology changes induced by survivin. To our surprise different SMAC- mimetics were ineffective to reverse the survivin- induced phenotype (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B</bold>), but induced mitochondrial fragmentation in SH-EP/Ctr cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A</bold>) without inducing cell death (<bold>Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">1</xref></bold>). This suggests that SMAC-mimetic-induced degradation of XIAP does not destabilize survivin. The observed effects on mitochondrial morphology were dependent on survivin and DRP1 expression levels since knock-down of either survivin or DRP1 reverses the fragmented phenotype (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>A and S2B</bold>). The knock- down of XIAP by short-hairpin RNA also increased mitochondrial fragmentation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E</bold>) suggesting that the disruption of XIAP-survivin complexes by SMAC-mimetics either by steric inhibition or degradation of XIAP (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C</bold>) triggers mitochondrial fragmentation <italic>via</italic> unbound survivin. The N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal of survivin <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> might become exposed only in these survivin molecules, which induces their mitochondrial localization. This disruption of XIAP/survivin complexes was accompanied by recruitment of DRP1 from the cytoplasm to mitochondria as well as a reduction of mitochondrial respiration complexes I and IV in SH-EP/Ctr cells to the same amount as in cells with moderate ectopic survivin expression (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B</bold>). Consistent with our results from neuroblastoma cells with amplification of 17q or ectopic expression of survivin, which leads to an increase in aerobic glycolysis, also the treatment with SMAC-mimetics increases the glucose consumption and lactate generation in SH-EP/Ctr cells, but not in SH-EP/shSurv cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D</bold>). In addition, ROS generation, induced by the chemotherapeutics doxorubicin, etoposide, or by activation of a 4OHT-inducible FOXO3-allele <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> was inhibited by pre-treatment of LCL161 or TL32711, again comparable to ectopically expressed survivin (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold> and <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We have shown before that FOXO3-induced ROS accumulation depends on the induction of the BH3-only protein BCL2L11/Bim <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, but SMAC-mimetics had no effect on transcriptional regulation of Bim (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref>A</bold>). Although it was reported that high ROS levels may repress survivin mRNA <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, in case of SMAC- mimetic treatment the lack of ROS-accumulation most likely results from survivin-translocation to mitochondria, mitochondrial fission and downregulation of respiratory complex I <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> as demonstrated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A</bold> and <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B</bold>. The combined data suggest that SMAC-mimetics cause XIAP degradation and disruption of XIAP/survivin complexes, which in turn releases sequestered survivin, triggers mitochondrial fragmentation by translocation of DRP1 to mitochondria and shifts energy metabolism to aerobic glycolysis. Since aerobic glycolysis correlates with chemoresistance and survivin is frequently expressed in tumor tissue, this might explain why many clinical trials on SMAC-mimetics failed. <italic>Via</italic> this mechanism survivin which is not targeted by SMAC-mimetics (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A</bold>) shifts the cells into an even more resistant phenotype that is comparable to cells carrying an amplification of survivin <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. This unwanted and potentially detrimental side-effect of SMAC-mimetics might increase resistance against chemotherapeutic agents that involve ROS-generation at mitochondria for cell death induction. As we recently identified glycolysis- inhibitors as regulators of survivin expression <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and cancer cells with elevated survivin are strongly glycolytic, we speculated that a combination of SMAC-mimetics with glycolysis-inhibitors might overcome the survivin- induced phenotype. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold> the combination of the SMAC-mimetics LCL161 or TL32711 with the 2DG indeed markedly reduced the viability of SH-EP/Ctr cells from over 80% with 2DG alone to 40%. As for mitochondrial fragmentation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>) this effect was dependent on survivin expression, since knock-down of survivin abolished the sensitizing effect (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, right panel</bold>). Additionally, our results were not limited to neuroblastoma cells, but were also observed in other cancer cell lines like colon cancer or leukemia cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D</bold>) and also exerted a highly significant <italic>in vivo</italic> effect in a xenograft transplantation mouse model. This is in line with some reports that simultaneously targeted XIAP and survivin and showed an increased therapy efficacy and reduced tumors growth <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>-<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. Therefore, analyses of the XIAP/survivin ratio might be useful as a diagnostic tool to predict the efficacy of SMAC-mimetics. Targeting survivin levels <italic>via</italic> glycolysis-inhibitors like 2DG, which are well tolerated and show no severe side effects, offers an attractive, non-genotoxic treatment strategy to increase the efficacy of SMAC-mimetics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM0"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Supplementary figures.</p></caption><media xlink:href="thnov09p4909s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Hermann Dietrich and his team for the animal care and Dr. Maximillian Seiter for technical support.
