Natural products from plants have been extensively used in the discovery of new biochemical pesticides with more success seen with bioinsecticide discovery programs as compared with biofungicide and bioherbicides [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Like many biopesticide discovery research programs, mosquito repellent research programs must also identify sources of lead natural compounds and biochemical structures for development or optimization. Biopesticide discovery programs utilize a range of proven techniques for the identification of natural compounds such as random screening of plants or microbial extracts, targeting of extracts from particular families known to possess these traits, targeting of certain compound classes, and screening of available crude extract or pure compound repositories and libraries [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. All of these techniques seem to rely on the ability to perform high-throughput screening to streamline the discovery process and it is common practice to assemble such repositories and libraries into a 96 well-plate format while evaluating sub milligram quantities of tested preparations. Mosquito repellent discovery offers unique challenges that are not conducive to such high-throughput programs forcing us to look more carefully at alternative methods for discovery of novel biochemicals. Examination of traditional or &#x0201c;folk&#x0201d; remedies used by native peoples has proven to be a valuable source of information when selecting plants to investigate for the presence of insect repelling natural compounds [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>An example of a traditional repellent remedy investigation that originated from knowledge communicated from a grandfather to a grandson pertains to using leaves from the American beautyberry plant, <italic>Callicarpa americana</italic> L., to prevent insect bites. A systematic investigation using a bioassay-guided fractionation approach led to the identification of spathulenol, intermedeol, and callicarpenal. Callicarpenal, intermedeol, and spathulenol proved to be highly effective biting deterrents against the mosquito species <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Another example can be found with Sweetgrass, <italic>Hierochloe odorata</italic> (L.) P. Beauv., where Flatheads of Montana and Blackfoot of Alberta would use braided plant material in a sachet in clothing or burn them from one end as an insect repellent. A bioassay-guided fractionation approach supported the traditional use of this plant and identified phytol and coumarin as the primary biting deterrent compounds [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Two additional traditional folk remedy examples from separate continents were burned and used as spatial insect repellents. Both were investigated independently and led to the same class of compounds responsible for the activity, namely fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One of these, <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> L., utilized the seed pressed oil that was burned in an oil lamp with the function of repelling biting insects. The other, breadfruit or <italic>Artocarpus altilis</italic> (Parkinson) Fosberg, utilized the male inflorescence which was also burned and functioned to prevent insect bites. The primary mosquito deterrent constituents from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>altilis</italic> were determined to be capric, undecanoic, and lauric acids while those from <italic>J</italic>. <italic>curcas</italic> were oleic, palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acids in addition to various triglycerides.</p><p>Pineapple weed, <italic>Matricaria discoidea</italic> DC.

Briefly the assay system consists of a six-well reservoir with each of the 3 &#x000d7; 4 cm wells containing 6 mL of feeding solution. As described by Ali et al., a feeding solution consisting of CPDA-1 (citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine) and ATP was used instead of blood [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Green fluorescent tracer dye (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blacklightword.com/">www.blacklightword.com</ext-link>) was used to determine feeding by the females. Essential oils, extracts and individual compounds were tested in this study. Essential oil and the extracts were applied at concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>, pure compounds at 25 nmol/cm<sup>2</sup>, and DEET (97%, <italic>N</italic>, <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-<italic>meta</italic>-toluamide) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 25 nmol/cm<sup>2</sup> as positive control. All treatments were freshly prepared in molecular biology grade 100% ethanol (Fisher Scientific Chemical Co. Fairlawn, NJ) at the time of bioassay. Temperature of the solution in the reservoirs was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C by continuously passing warm water through the reservoir using a circulatory bath. Reservoirs were covered with a layer of collagen membrane (Devro, Sandy Run, SC). Test compounds were randomly applied to six 4 &#x000d7; 5 cm areas of organdy cloth and positioned over the membrane-covered CPDA-1+ATP solution with a Teflon separator placed between the treated cloth and the six-celled module to prevent contamination of the module. A six-celled K&#x00026;D module containing five female mosquitoes per cell was positioned over the cloth treatments covering the six CPDA-1 + ATP solution membrane wells, and trap doors were opened to expose the treatments to these females. The number of mosquitoes biting through cloth treatments in each cell was recorded after a 3-min exposure and mosquitoes were prodded back into the cells to check the actual feeding. Mosquitoes were squashed and the presence or absence of green fluorescent tracer dye in the gut was used as an indicator of feeding. A replicate consisted of six treatments: four test materials, DEET (a standard biting deterrent) and ethanol-treated organdy as solvent control applied randomly. Four replications each with 5 females per treatment were conducted for the essential oil, extracts and pure compounds.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> A &#x00026; K repellent bioassay</title><p>As described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the A &#x00026; K bioassay system is based on the concept that the mosquitoes are attracted to warm temperatures and this system uses warm temperature to serve as stimulus for landing and feeding.

Often the oil activity is reported only and we are left to speculate on which individual constituents are responsible for the activity of the oil as a whole. Many of these essential oil evaluations are reported to contain some of the constituents isolated from this study that likely contribute to their efficacy; however, there is no evidence in these manuscripts that identify the specific constituents are responsible for the activity.</p><p>There are thorough evaluations of individual compounds for a few of the constituents isolated in this study. For example, limonene was previously isolated from <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic> and found to work as a repellent against <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> at 1.4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. &#x003b1;-terpineol has been reported from a variety of natural sources and most recently, it was shown to possess a MED value of 0.039 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> in human evaluations for topical repellency [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Spathulenol was reported to be partly responsible for the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> repellency of the traditionally used plant <italic>Callicarpa americana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this report, spathulenol demonstrated a PNB of 0.73 at 25 nmoles/cm<sup>2</sup> as compared to the positive control SS220 with a PNB of 0.80 at 25 nmoles/cm<sup>2</sup>. This value is similar to that which we observed in this study. Its worth noting that in this investigation and the previous investigation spathulenol was observed by NMR to degrade quickly, making it difficult to obtain repellency data before some decomposition occurs. Furthermore, when working with small quantities of spathulenol and the requirement to remove solvent via evaporation during purification, combined with the high volatility of spathulenol, all make it difficult to perform such repellency bioassays due to the difficulty in obtaining an accurate weight of the sample for bioassay purposes. Hence, the unstable nature and volatility of spathulenol may explain the minor differences observed. This appears to be the first report on the <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> mosquito repellency of isohumbertiols, dendrolasin, neryl isovalerate, and (E)-en-yn-dicycloether. Scientific evidence reported here validates the traditional use of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>discoidea</italic> as a biting-insect deterrent and identified a variety of compounds responsible for this effect. As this is the first report on the insect repellency of neryl isovalerate, more work is needed to determine if this compound can be used as a natural alternative to the more widely used synthetic insect repellents, DEET, IR3535 or picaridin [<xref rid="pone.0206594.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Solomon Green III for technical assistance.
