To test the hypothesis that ribbon assembly stabilizes nascent synapses, we performed simultaneous time-lapse imaging of fluorescently-tagged ribbons in retinal cone bipolar cells (BCs) and postsynaptic densities (PSD95-FP) of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Ribbons and PSD95-FP clusters were more stable when these components colocalized at synapses. However, synapse density on ON-alpha RGCs was unchanged in mice lacking ribbons (<italic>ribeye</italic> knockout). Wildtype BCs make both ribbon-containing and ribbon-free synapses with these GCs even at maturity. Ribbon assembly and cone BC-RGC synapse maintenance are thus regulated independently. Despite the absence of synaptic ribbons, RGCs continued to respond robustly to light stimuli, although quantitative examination of the responses revealed reduced frequency and contrast sensitivity.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Ribbon synapses in our sensory nervous system are central to hearing and sight, yet little is known about how these synapses are assembled and maintained during development.

Vesicles containing the neurotransmitter glutamate are found tethered to the ribbons, which are anchored at active zones where transmitter release occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Vesicles at the base of the ribbon are poised for fast transmitter release, ideal for reporting the rapid onset of stimuli, whereas those further up the ribbon contribute to continuous or sustained transmission, well suited for signaling the intensity and duration of a stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Ribbon synapses are characteristic of primary sensory neurons such as the light-sensitive photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina and the pineal organ and mechanosensitive hair cells in the cochlea, the vestibular organ and the fish lateral line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although we have gained significant knowledge of the physiological properties and structural arrangements of ribbon synapses over the years, less is known about how these synapses are assembled and maintained during development.</p><p id="Par4">Previous studies suggest that the formation of presynaptic ribbons does not necessarily rely on contact and differentiation of the postsynaptic processes. In the cochlea, a presynaptic complex containing ribbons forms in hair cell terminals before postsynaptic densities are apparent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Similarly, ultrastructural studies suggest that ribbons are present in retinal photoreceptor axon terminals before postsynaptic horizontal cell processes invaginate the terminal, and prior to the elaboration of dendrites from their other postsynaptic partner, the bipolar cells (BCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Ribbons are present in hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line in the absence of afferent fibers of the lateral line ganglion neurons, although often these structures are displaced from the active zone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Such misplacements have also been found in hair cells isolated in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or when afferent fibers are damaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, knockdown of <italic>ribeye</italic> in zebrafish, which leads to a decrease in ribbon numbers in the hair cells, results in a reduction of afferent contact and perturbed postsynaptic density distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Collectively, these findings suggest that ribbons may form prior to postsynaptic specializations and may play instructive roles in postsynaptic differentiation at synapses made by primary sensory neurons.</p><p id="Par5">The assembly of ribbon synapses beyond those of primary sensory neurons (e.g., hair cells, photoreceptors) and the requirement of ribbons for synapse maintenance are, however, not well explored. To fill these gaps in knowledge, we focused on circuitry in the inner retina of vertebrates, where ribbon synapses play a key role in the transmission of information from the outer retina to the retinal output neurons, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the mouse retina, BCs form ribbon synapses with their postsynaptic partners, the amacrine cells and RGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The axons of BCs, unlike those of primary sensory neurons such as the photoreceptors, have complex branching patterns and establish ribbon synapses at many locations on the dendrites of postsynaptic partners. Whether there is a stereotyped sequence in the developmental assembly of these ribbon synapses is not known.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Number of axonal ribbons of distinct ON BC types across development. <bold>a</bold> Schematics showing the key neurons of this study and their ribbon synapses.

This view is supported by the finding that spontaneous glutamatergic currents are detected in RGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> before ribbons are evident in the IPL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that maturation of nascent synapses between BCs and RGCs, and their maintenance thereafter, commences after the arrival of ribbons at initial functional contact sites. To test this hypothesis directly, we performed live-cell imaging of ribbon synapses between BCs and their postsynaptic RGCs in developing and adult mouse retinas. We tracked ribbon dynamics using a new transgenic mouse line in which ribbons are tagged by a red fluorescent protein. We correlated ribbon dynamics with the appearance or maintenance of glutamatergic postsynaptic densities on RGCs to determine whether there is a strict sequence of developmental events in the assembly of bipolar-ganglion cell ribbon synapses. Specifically, we asked whether nascent bipolar-ganglion cell synapses become stabilized only after ribbons emerge at the contact sites. Finally, we analyzed synaptic development between cone BCs and the RGCs in <italic>ribeye</italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> to determine whether their pattern of connectivity critically depends on the presence of ribbons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>BCs increase their ribbon numbers rapidly before eye-opening</title><p id="Par7">In the <italic>Grm6-tdTomato</italic> line, at least three types of ON cone BCs, Types (T) 6, 7, and 8, are labeled by expression of a red fluorescent protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, see Methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

These BC types differentially contact RGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For example, ON-alpha RGCs receive the majority of their input from T6 bipolar cells, with some contact from T7 and T8 BCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Ribbons within the axon terminals of each of these BC types were revealed by immunostaining for the C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Digital subtraction of the immunolabel outside the volume of the axon (see <italic>Methods</italic>) enabled quantification of the total number of ribbons within the volume of the axon terminal. We compared the developmental time-course in the growth of the axon terminal and in the appearance of ribbons across these BC types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). T8 BCs maintained their axonal arbor size, whereas both T6 and T7 BCs increased their axonal volume between postnatal days P9 to P21 (T6: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0015, T7: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5347, T8: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5347, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis rank sum test; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6&#x02013;10 cells from 4&#x02013;8 retinas for each age-group of each BC type; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Ribbons within the axon terminals were detected by CtBP2 immunolabeling as early as P7. For all three BC types, the total number of ribbons within an axon terminal increased with age (Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis rank sum test, T6: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.102e-05, T7: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.208e-05, T8: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0005), with the most rapid increase occurring before eye-opening, P15 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>). T6 and T7 BCs thus increase in their ribbon number concurrent with axonal growth, whereas T8 BCs do so without significant expansion of their axonal volume.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Synaptic ribbons are visualized live in <italic>RIBEYE-tagRFP</italic> retina</title><p id="Par8">Although observations from fixed tissue provided a clear timeline for the developmental increase in ribbon numbers within the ON BC axons, such observations do not reveal the dynamics of ribbon formation at BC synapses or enable us to ascertain whether or not ribbons are eliminated in BC axons during development.

We extended these EM findings by further analysis of serial transmission EM sections, and provide examples here of ribbon containing and ribbon-free synaptic contacts between morphologically identified T6 BCs and an ON-alpha RGC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e, f</xref>). Ribbon-free contacts were identified by the presence and apposition of pre- and postsynaptic densities at the BC-RGC contact site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>). Thus, a BC type or even an individual BC can make both ribbon containing and ribbon-free synapses with RGCs; ribbon-free synapses are thus not a transient developmental anomaly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">We used transgenic mice, live-cell imaging, and quantitative approaches to track the dynamics of ribbons during synaptogenesis and maturation of the mouse inner retina. We adopted these approaches together with <italic>ribeye-ko</italic> mice to determine whether ribbons are necessary for stabilizing nascent contacts between retinal BCs and RGCs. Our experiments provide a dynamic view of the assembly of cone bipolar-ganglion cell ribbon synapses, and also demonstrate clear but surprisingly modest effects on the connectivity and RGC signaling in both rod and cone retinal circuits in the absence of ribbons throughout the retina.</p><p id="Par24">A previous EM study showed that synaptic ribbons appear in the mouse retinal IPL around P10, and increase in number until about 3 weeks after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our present study showed that, during this period, the number of ribbons within individual T6, T7, or T8 BC axon terminals increased steadily, but at different rates. The number of ribbons within individual T6 and T7 BC terminals at P21 identified under light microscopy were comparable to previous measurements obtained from EM reconstructions of these BC types in 9-week-old adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, T6 and T7 BCs appear to reach their adult ribbon numbers at juvenile ages. EM reconstruction of a T8 BC uncovered fewer ribbons in this BC type in the adult retina compared to our analysis of T8 BCs at P21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This may be because the EM reconstructed T8 BC is smaller than the average size of the cells we analyzed here. Another possibility is that after P21 T8 BCs undergo axonal pruning and ribbon synapse elimination, processes known to occur at their dendrites in the outer retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Analysis of fixed tissue cannot reveal whether ribbons are always maintained once localized to a synapse. The <italic>RIBEYE-tagRFP-T</italic> transgenic mouse enabled us to monitor ribbon dynamics in individual BC axon terminals. We observed both the formation and elimination of ribbons in immature and mature retinas. Although both additions and eliminations were captured during our time-lapse imaging, we did not observe a net increase in &#x02018;synapses&#x02019; at the end, suggesting that the overall increase of ribbon number with age occurs gradually over hours to days, consistent with the estimation by Fisher (1979)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Not surprisingly, the frequency of both additions and eliminations declined with age. The relatively few additions and eliminations of ribeye puncta in mature BCs occurred at stable axonal boutons. Whether these events constitute changes in the organization or distribution of active zones or even formation or loss of specific synapses remains to be elucidated. Regardless, although rare, such changes suggest that BC axons retain ongoing plasticity in the adult retina.</p><p id="Par26">Our time-lapse analysis of ribbon synapse development differs from past work on synaptogenesis of cultured neurons in several ways. Previous time-lapse analyses tracked synaptogenesis by marking presynaptic terminals by expression of fluorescently-tagged synaptic vesicle proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> or bassoon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, or by FM-dye update<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and postsynaptic differentiation by PSD95-GFP expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> or by glutamate receptor accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. While findings in culture suggest that presynaptic proteins generally appear at the site of contact a few hours before PSD95 accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, we find that ribbons could appear after a PSD95 punctum is already at the contact site. This may not be surprising because EM observations suggest that ribbons are likely localized after synaptic vesicles are already present at BC contacts with RGCs. Further, although presynaptic components have been found to transport as &#x02018;packages&#x02019; to synaptic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, we did not observe transport of ribbons along the BC axon shaft or within its branches. At both P11 and P40, ribeye puncta emerged over time at sites of contacts between BCs and RGCs, presumably upon localized accumulation of this protein. Ribeye puncta were largely added to stable parts of the axonal terminal, rather than at filopodia. It remains possible, however, that ribbon precursors such as those previously identified in photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> are also present in immature BC axons, and that their small size precludes visualization by fluorescence imaging under confocal microscopy. Ribeye puncta in the BC axons can appear very rapidly, within tens of minutes. Fast accumulation of ribeye proteins has also been shown in zebrafish skin cells by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Previous culture studies of hippocampal neurons demonstrate that synapse elimination can occur after pre- and postsynaptic components are assembled at a contact site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Likewise, we found that ribeye puncta that are apposed to PSD95 puncta can be eliminated, suggesting that loss of ribeye at least at some locations is likely associated with removal at synapses. Ribeye puncta that are apposed to PSD95 are, however, relatively more stable compared to those that are not associated with PSD95 at the time of imaging. Some ribbons that were not apposed to PSD95 may appear stable because they may be at glutamatergic sites containing other PSDs, such as SAP102<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. If so, the survival rates for ribbons at nascent synapses lagging in postsynaptic maturation would be even lower. We also observed that PSD95 puncta that were not apposed to ribbons are less stable. The loss of these postsynaptic puncta may be due to a failure of the presynaptic sites to further differentiate, or these may be PSD95 sites previously associated with a ribbon that had dismantled. Indeed, we have on occasion observed the disassembly of PSD95 clusters at contacts that contain both these structures. Previous work suggests that loss of either pre or postsynaptic components can lead to synapse disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, but whether loss of ribeye or PSD95 puncta during our imaging period reflects the eventual loss of physical contact remains to be confirmed. This can be achieved in the future by combining time-lapse imaging of ribbons and PSD95 with serial EM reconstructions, using correlative fluorescence imaging and serial block-face scanning EM methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Although our time-lapse analysis suggests that nascent BC-RGC synapses are more stable when ribbons are present, such observations cannot predict how BC-RGC synaptic development would be affected without ribbons over an extended time-scale of weeks in vivo. We found that ON-alpha RGCs in <italic>ribeye-ko</italic> mice possessed normal PSD95 puncta densities and continued to respond robustly to light stimuli. Quantitative analysis, however, revealed alterations in light responses of RGCs from <italic>ribeye-ko</italic> retinas compared to littermate controls, with decreases in spontaneous release, frequency sensitivity and contrast sensitivity. Light-evoked responses, however, were overall surprisingly normal. This was unexpected not only because of the complete loss of ribbons in the IPL, but also because of their absence in the photoreceptor terminals.</p><p id="Par29">Previous work showed that fast and sustained transmission from rod BCs to AII amacrine cells were reduced ~4-fold in the <italic>ribeye-ko</italic>, although rod BCs still formed synaptic dyads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This is substantially larger than the &#x0003c;2-fold changes we observe in the light response, particularly at low light levels in which responses traverse the retina through the rod bipolar pathway. Comparison of our current findings with the effects on rod BC circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> thus leads to two conclusions: (1) ribbons are not critical for the structural formation of synapses between BCs and RGCs, and (2) direct measures of synaptic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> can reveal deficits that have modest effect on light-evoked responses. Indeed, marked reductions in both sustained and phasic release have been observed after acute photodamage of ribbons in both cones and bipolar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Further work will be required to determine whether the relatively small impact of loss of ribbons on light-evoked responses reflects redundant synaptic mechanisms or compensatory changes when ribbons are absent.</p><p id="Par30">Like the ON-alpha RGC, stimulus-evoked spike rates of afferent neurons postsynaptic to lateral line hair cells in zebrafish <italic>rib</italic>eye mutants appear normal, although there is increased exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Our recordings from the RGCs and the zebrafish work contrast with recent findings showing impaired temporal precision in sound encoding involving inner hair cells of <italic>ribeye-ko</italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Thus, different circuits even within a sensory modality (rod vs cone BCs; hair cells in fish and mice) may compensate differentially for loss of ribbons.</p><p id="Par31">The ability of cone BCs to form conventional (ribbon-free) synapses with RGCs may seem abnormal in <italic>ribeye-ko</italic> mice. However, conventional synapses between BCs and RGCs have been documented previously in goldfish, salamander, rabbit, mouse, and primate retinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. We also show here the presence of ribbon-free synapses on adult ON-alpha RGCs in wild-type retina. These synapses could contribute to the modest effects of removal of ribbons on RGC light responses. A parsimonious explanation for two types of BC synapses is that ribbon-free synapses on the RGC dendrites are formed largely with a specific BC type. Although this remains plausible, we found that an individual T6 BC cell makes both ribbon and ribbon-free synapses with ON-alpha RGCs. Future experiments are needed to ascertain whether non-ribbon bearing BC synapses represent functional divergence at the level of individual synapses between a BC and RGC pair. However, the inconsistent proportion of ribbon-free synapses across axons of a specific BC type (T6 here) suggests that ribbon-free synapses are unlikely to have a unique function at least in T6-ON-alpha RGC circuits. It would be still be informative in the future to determine whether other RGC types receive input at ribbon-free synapses, and if so, whether connections with specific BC input types are involved.</p><p id="Par32">The presence of ribbon-free synapses in wild-type adult retina and the normal cone BC synapse density on the ON-alpha RGCs in the <italic>ribeye-KO</italic> raises the question of what presynaptic proteins may be engaged in stabilizing these BC synapses in wild-type and <italic>ribeye-KO</italic> retinas. Disruption of several pre- or postsynaptic molecules in the outer retina that provide a trans-synaptic link between photoreceptors and BCs have been identified (reviewed by ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>). Of these, loss of CaV<sub>1.4</sub>, specifically the &#x003b1;2&#x003b4;-4 auxiliary subunit of this voltage-gated calcium channel, results in the disappearance of full-length ribbons at rod photoreceptor terminals; rod and also cone postsynaptic arrangements are disrupted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The &#x003b1;2&#x003b4;-2 subunit has similarly been found to be important for organizing synapses of inner hair cells in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The identity and molecular organization of the calcium channels localized to presynaptic terminals of cone BCs have not yet been fully defined. But, future work assessing the cone BC output synapses in mouse mutants with BCs lacking various voltage-gated calcium channels will be informative, potentially identifying a role for such channels in regulating cone BC-RGC synaptic development.</p><p id="Par33">In summary, our experiments with the <italic>RIBEYE-tagRFP-T</italic> mice demonstrate that although synaptic ribbons can influence the stability of nascent BC synapses in the inner retina, their presence is not essential for establishing wild-type synapse densities between a type of cone BC and its target RGC in vivo. This finding is in line with the initial characterization of the <italic>ribeye-ko</italic> mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which demonstrated a largely normal ultrastructure of retinal ribbon synapses, except for the complete absence of synaptic ribbons, and normal synaptic architecture of both retinal photoreceptor synapses and rod BC synapses. Similarly, RGCs exhibited surprisingly modest alterations in their light responses in the absence of ribbons. Because excitatory synapse densities on ON-alpha RGCs appear unperturbed, future studies can exploit the circuitry of this RGC type to determine whether ribbons are dispensable for the function of some cone BCs and not others, for example those providing major versus minor input onto the RGC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par34">All experiments were conducted following animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Washington.
