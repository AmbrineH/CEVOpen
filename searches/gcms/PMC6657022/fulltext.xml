Swingle (syn. C. MEDICA var. ACIDA Brandis) (family: Rutaceae) essential oil is one of the cheapest oils found in local markets. Although, it is generally accepted as non-toxic to vital organs and cells, majority of people are cynical about it usage. Herein, the present study reports the chemical composition and <italic>in vivo</italic> oral toxicity study of unripe <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic> essential oil found in Ghana. The toxicity of <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic> essential oil extract was investigated <italic>via</italic> oral administration using two methods: The acute toxicity single dose study (SDS) and the repeated dose method. The oil exhibited no acute toxicity but in the sub-chronic studies, the effects was dose and time-dependent. Chemical profile investigation of the oil showed 9 constituent of phytochemicals (Germacrene isomers (61.2%), Pineen (14%), Linalool dimmer (2.9%), Bornane (11%), Citral (2.9%), Anethole (1.5%), Anisole (1.1%), Safrole (0.3%) and Demitol (0.6%)). Histopathological studies revealed conditions such as necrosis, edema and inflammatory reaction in the liver, spleen and kidneys. Marginal upsurge of biochemical parameters above normal and elevated levels of lymphocytes (35.20&#x02013;46.40&#x0202f;g/dL) demonstrated mild toxicity among the 100&#x0202f;mg/kg and 500&#x0202f;mg/kg dose groups at the sub-chronic stage. Low levels of hemoglobin (13.60 to 12.70&#x0202f;g/dL), MCV (34.20&#x02013;24.0&#x0202f;fL), MCH (40.20&#x02013;36.40&#x0202f;g/dL) along with high levels of liver enzymes confirmed the mild toxicity of the oil at sub-chronic stage. These results demonstrate that, despite consideration of lime essential oil as safe, it can have mild hematotoxic, nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Citrus aurantifolia</italic></kwd><kwd>Biochemical analysis</kwd><kwd><italic>In vivo</italic> toxicity</kwd><kwd>Histopathological</kwd><kwd>Hepatotoxicity</kwd><kwd>Nephrotoxicity</kwd><kwd>Hematological</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0005">The Search for medicinal plants and their phytochemicals as alternative for treating various diseases has generated interest among researchers. Although, <italic>C. aurantifolia&#x02019;s</italic> (Lime) exact lineage is doubtful, the perception is that it was grown first in Indonesia or Southeast Asia, before transported to the Mediterranean Region and Northern Africa around 1000 CE [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Ghana and other West Africa countries, lime fruits and its juice is a major medicinal recipe for local folks. The juice in combination with neem leaves extract has been used for managing malaria, diabetes, and other parasitic diseases [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Locally, it is a major anti-deodorant agent, and also added to local gin (&#x0201c;Akpeteshie&#x0201d;) for taste as well as masking of odour of the &#x0201c;Akpeteshie&#x0201d;. The lime juice mixed with other plant extract has been a major remedy for boil control locally. The root back is a good febrifuge. Decoction of the bark is a major remedy for gonorrhoea and related disorders. In Nigeria, the roots of the plant are chewed for headache, and eaten as a vermifuge. The leave is use as a lotion for fever and eye disease [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The other component of lime fruit which has not been utilized and ignored locally is its essential oil. Steam distillation and cold pressing are two main methods used to extract Lime (<italic>Citrus aurantifolia</italic>) essential oil mainly from the fruit rind. A study on aromatic volatiles in key lime oil has revealed that the freshnes and citrus aroma is as result of its major constituents such as: geranial, neural, and linalool [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These constituents are attributable to the immense properties (astringent, tonic, antiseptic, antiviral, antimicrobial, restorative, stimulant) of the oil [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Above all, they are also responsible for the health-promoting attributes [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. In small doses, lime essential oil is known to serve as an appetizer and to increase one&#x02019;s appetite when smelled [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In certain parts of Ghana, people smear the essential oil of lime on their skin to prevent mosquito bites, and some add it to their drinking water for enhanced flavour and as antioxidants [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. One of the major uses of essential oil is aromatherapy. This treatment regimen could be used to induce relaxation, but there is lack of information or evidence to prove essential oils effectivness in treating this condition [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Improper use of essential oils may cause harm, including allergic reactions and skin irritation which are some of the side effects from improper use of the lime essential. Children in particular may be the most affected group via improper use of the oil [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. D-limonene is among the major components of lime essential oil which has been reported to have certain effects on the lungs at certain concentrations [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One typical example, is the pumonary exposure of human volunteers to d-limonene which caused a decrease in the lung vital capacity at highest doses [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Research has established that renal problems caused by essential oil in humans are rare and if it should occur, it is usually associated with oral overdose in acute dosing [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Much have been established concerning adverse effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including essential oil constituents on the lungs and other tissues [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. If exposure is high enough, VOCs can cause sensory irritation of the airways characterized by irritation, tickling, burning, cooling, warming and stinging in the nasal cavities. Bronchial hyperactivity (BHR) is also an adverse effect associated with exposure to VOCs [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Long term exposure to moderate concentrations of mixtures of terpenes (an essential oil constituent) entails possible health risk [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="par0010">Generally, lime essential oil is acknowledged as safe (GRAS) when used as a food additive and food flavouring agent by an American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, however, no published repeated dose toxicity study is available on the oral use of lime essential oil as medication or dietary supplement. Information on toxicity of lime essential oils when used as drug or dietary supplements is therefore scanty [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, not much is known about the toxic effects of the lime essential oil found in Ghana, but the originator of toxicology, Paracelsus, professed that &#x0201c;all substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison, the right dose differentiates a poison from a remedy&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This statement makes it imperative to investigate the toxicity of lime essential oil of the unripe fruits, since the unripe oil has been effective in treating several diseases locally. As several essential oils are considered &#x0201c;GRAS&#x0201d;, yet most essential oils have not been studied, especially, in concentrated internal amounts for which lime essential oil is one [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Ecologically, there has been few complains of pains of the heart when oil is added in drinking water. Also, burning sensation when the oil was massaged onto the skin have been reported by the users. Taking into account the rampant use of the oil all over the world, especially, Ghanaians and the fact that toxicological data lacking, we aimed to evaluate the acute, sub-acute and sub-chronic toxicity of the unripe oil extracted from slurry of entire lime fruit. Thus far, no documented toxicological assessments of unripe lime essential oil in which mainly monoterpenes are present. However, no documented fact regarding toxicity of unripe lime essential oil was found in literature. Unlike the ripe oil, the impact of unripe essential oil toxicity may be greatly be affected either positively or negatively, due to its chemical complexity. This is because, unripe lime essential oil has been found to comprise a greater number of metabolites compare to rip oil. Traditionally, the ripe oil is the most utilized oil. Preliminary investigation of unripe lime essential oil has demonstrated several potential therapeutic efficacy superior to the ripe oil. Such therapeutic efficacies are: anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-diabetic, anti-leishmanial as well as wound healing. Hypothetically, the unripe oil is expected to have no detrimental effect on vital organs.</p><p id="par0015"><bold>Aim of The Study</bold></p><p id="par0020">The main intent of the present work was to investigate <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity profile of unripe essential oil.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Chemicals and materials</title><p id="par0025">Reagents and Chemicals: absolute alcohol, xylene, paraffin wax, formaldehyde and eosin were acquired from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification.

This result might indicate injury to the liver. This is because ALT is more specific for hepatic injury since it is found mainly in the hepatocytes. Comparing the liver enzyme data among low and medium dose groups with the high dose group, high dose resulted in an increased levels of the liver enzymes. This could be as a result of the mild derangements impacted on the hepatocytes in this group. In addition, the amount of conjugated bilirubin increased and that of unconjugated bilirubin decreased in all the groups relative to the normal control. The high levels of the conjugated bilirubin might be as a result of increased levels of liver enzymes within the liver cells that process the bilirubin. This could also be due to hepatocytic cell damage seen in the histological analysis, affecting liver function. These may facilitate bilirubin spill into the blood stream [<xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Comparing levels of bilirubin recorded in the low and medium dose groups to those recorded in the high dose, the high dose group had higher levels of conjugated bilirubin and very low levels of unconjugated bilirubin.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0010"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Serum biochemical parameters in rats treated orally with unadulterated Lime Essential oil (daily dose) at the sub-acute stage (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10).</p></caption><alt-text id="at0045">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="2">Biochemical Parameters (+SEM)</th><th colspan="5" align="left">Determined Dosages (mg/kg bw)<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Normal control</th><th align="left">Low (50)</th><th align="left">Medium (100)</th><th align="left">High (500)</th><th align="left"><sup>a</sup>Reference range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Cholesterol (mmol/L)</td><td align="left">1.61 <underline>+</underline> 0.12</td><td align="left">1.58<underline>+</underline>0.01&#x0202f;ns</td><td align="left">1.58<underline>+</underline>0.01&#x0202f;ns</td><td align="left">1.79 <underline>+</underline>0.01&#x0202f;ns</td><td align="left">1.20-2.38</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Triglyceride (mmol/L)</td><td align="left">0.86<underline>+</underline>0.01</td><td align="left">0.67<underline>+</underline>0.01&#x0202f;ns</td><td align="left">0.62<underline>+</underline>0.01&#x0202f;ns</td><td align="left">0.78<underline>+</underline>0.01&#x0202f;ns</td><td align="left">0.35&#x02013;1.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">HDL (mg/dL)</td><td align="left">22.00<underline>+</underline>1.16</td><td align="left">33.00<underline>+</underline>0.29<sup>***</sup></td><td align="left">33.00<underline>+</underline>1.16<sup>***</sup></td><td align="left">47.00<underline>+</underline>1.16<sup>***</sup></td><td align="left">20.0-23.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LDL (g/dL)</td><td align="left">25.00<underline>+</underline>0.58</td><td align="left">16.00<underline>+</underline>1.16<sup>***</sup></td><td align="left">17.00<underline>+</underline>0.58<sup>***</sup></td><td align="left">18.00<underline>+</underline>0.57<sup>**</sup></td><td align="left">23.5-27.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">VLDL (mg/L)</td><td align="left">15.00<underline>+</underline>1.73</td><td align="left">12.00<underline>+</underline>1.16 ns</td><td align="left">11.00<underline>+</underline>0.58&#x0202f;ns</td><td align="left">14.00<underline>+</underline>0.29ns</td><td align="left">15.5-20.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Dir.

This result might indicate severe damage to the liver as a result of depletion of ALT levels in the liver. The resolution above agrees with Al-seeni et al. who discovered decline in liver enzymes after tartrazine was administered to rats [<xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Comparing the levels of AST among the low, medium and high dose groups administered rats, it could be observed from the results that, the levels of AST decrease as the dose increases, while the levels of ALT drastically increased among low and medium dose administered rats, except in the high dose rats which recorded decreased levels (<xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Finally, there were increasing levels of unconjugated bilirubin and decrease levels of conjugated bilirubin among all the various groups of rats as compared to the control group. This reason might be as a result of increased rate of red blood cells breakdown; consequently, there is much unconjugated bilirubin in the blood waiting to be conjugated by the liver. Again, injured hepatocytes revealed during histopathological analysis, are unable to keep pace with the processing of the unconjugated bilirubin. This increased amount of bilirubin in the plasma, accounting for the increasing levels of unconjugated bilirubin. The situation could also be attributed to an interrupted regulation of hepatobiliary conveyance systems at the sinusoidal and canalicular membrane of hepatocytes by the individual components of the unripe lime essential oil [<xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0150"><label>3.5</label><title>Analysis of hematological parameters</title><p id="par0180"><xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> depicts the hematological data of the sub-acute studies. The levels of RBCs increased significantly in all the groups at the sub-acute stage. The same results can be observed in the medium and high dose groups at the sub-chronic stage of the study (<xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) compared to the control and reference range. The trend of hematological result is attributed to uncontrolled erythropoiesis activities in the bone marrow due to low oxygen levels, in this case, more RBCs is produced to compensate for any condition that results in low oxygen levels [<xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This also reflects a corresponding increase in the hematocrit levels since hematocrit determines the percentage of RBCs in blood by volume that is composed of RBCs. Surprisingly, the levels of RBC from the low dose group at the sub-chronic stage (<xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) were normal.

The decreased levels of hemoglobin might have resulted from the inability to utilize iron to make hemoglobin, as a result there was a decreased level of MCV due to small average RBCs size which might be a deficiency of iron, and this phenomenon is supported by mild to moderate hemosiderin deposit within the spleen of these groups.

The platelet and lymphocyte levels increased drastically (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001) in both sub-acute and sub-chronic stages (<xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), except in the high dose group which appears to show a decreased level. This might be as a result of inflammation in the liver leading to bone marrow production of more platelets and lymphocytes to heal wounds and fight against etiological agents respectively, as reported earlier [<xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. While the decrease levels of the platelets in sub-chronic high dose group might be due to damage to the liver, it reduces the levels of globulin produced to assist in blood clotting [<xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The inflammation in the liver is also confirmed by the decrease levels of MID at the sub-acute stage (<xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and also by histopathology studies (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0155"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="par0190">On the whole, it seems the consumption of lime essential oil leads to cellular injury (necrosis) and trigger inflammatory response in tissues. These effects are strongly attributed to &#x003b2;-pinene, trans-anethole, germacrene D and linalool which are the main components of the oil identified by GC/MS. The present results means continuous exposure to the oil could lead to organ malfunction. However, the oil does not seem to elicit any signs of acute toxicity or to have any significant effect on weight. From the results obtained, it is safe to conclude that the oil has some form of toxic effects on some of the vital organs at the sub-chronic stage. Considering the pathological effects seen in the various tissues and the fact that these effects became more severe as the dosage and time of exposure to the oil increased, further work will be crucial to explain this concept. From the results, it is recommended that mechanistic tests be carried out to determine exactly how the oil causes the changes seen in the organs. Other routes of administration should be considered since the oil is used in a lot of ways.</p></sec><sec id="sec0160"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="par0195">The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Narang</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiraungkoorskul</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anticancer activity of key lime</article-title><source>Citrus aurantifolia Pharmacogn.
