    "Purpose:The volatile compounds that contribute to the flavor of pork are unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the differences in volatile compounds from pork meats of four different pig breeds using headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME)/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Methods:Piglets from four breeds (8/breed) (crossbred Ziwuling Sus scrofa [SUS] and purebreds Bamei pig [BAM], American Yorkshire pig [YOK], and Hezuo pig [HZP]) were selected. Characteristics of meat were measured. HS-SPME/GC-MS were used to analyze the volatile compounds of the meats. Results:The tenderness, taste, succulence, and broth flavor of the BAM and HZP were good. One hundred and eight volatile compounds with known molecular formulas were identified in BAM, 106 in SUS, 98 in YOK, and 98 in HZP. Sixty-four common volatile compounds were found in all four breeds. The highest relative amount of volatile compounds was found in the BAM. The compounds which may contribute to the flavor of pork were 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-nonanal, octanal, hexanal, 2-pentyl-furan, 1-penten-3-one, N-morpholinomethyl-isopropyl-sulfide, methyl butyrate, and (E,E)-2, 4-decadienal. Conclusion:The volatile compounds in pork belong to several classes, and the highest relative amount of volatile compounds was found in BAM."
