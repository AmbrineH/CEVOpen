Abstract</div> <p> <div class="graphic_UNKNOWN" /> </p> <p>Although Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) have gained attention in recent years, there are few cases of their upscaled application for lactone synthesis. A thermostable cyclohexanone monooxygenase from <i>Thermocrispum municipale</i> (TmCHMO) was applied to the oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone using a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) for cofactor regeneration. The reaction progress was improved by optimizing the biocatalyst loading, with investigation into oxygen limitations. The product concentration and productivity were increased by keeping the substrate concentration below the inhibitory level via continuous substrate feeding (CSF). This substrate feeding strategy was evaluated against two biphasic reactions using either toluene or <i>n</i>-butyl acetate as immiscible organic solvents. A product concentration of 38 g L <sup>–1</sup> and a space-time yield of 1.35 g L <sup>–1</sup> h <sup>–1</sup> were achieved during the gram-scale synthesis of the two regioisomeric lactones by applying the CSF strategy. These improvements contribute to the large-scale application of BVMOs in the synthesis of branched building blocks for polymer applications. </p> </div> <div class="custom-meta-group" title="custom-meta-group"> <meta name="document-id-old-9" value="op8b00079" /> <meta name="document-id-new-14" value="op-2018-000792" /> <meta name="ccc-price" value="" /> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <div class="introduction" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p>Oxidative chemistry plays a major role in the chemical industry. <sup> <a href="#ref1">1</a> </sup> About one-third of industrial biocatalyzed processes, half of which are oxidation reactions, involve redox enzymes. <sup> <a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a> </sup> These biocatalysts offer an alternative of lower toxicity by replacing conventional toxic oxidants with molecular oxygen or H <sub>2</sub>O <sub>2</sub> and by operating under mild aqueous conditions rather than in pure organic solvents. <sup> <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a> </sup> Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) in particular have gained interest in recent years, with efforts in enzyme discovery, <sup> <a href="#ref6">6</a> </sup> enzyme engineering, <sup> <a href="#ref7">7</a> </sup> and development toward their application. <sup> <a href="#ref8">8</a> </sup> BVMOs are an interesting alternative to the classical chemical Baeyer–Villiger reaction thanks to their enantio- and regioselectivity on a wide range of substrates. <sup> <a href="#ref9">9</a> </sup> This differentiating feature is particularly relevant for pharmaceutical compounds, where chirality is crucial. <sup> <a href="#ref10">10</a> </sup> As a consequence, upscaling efforts at pilot-plant scale using BVMOs have mainly focused on pharmaceutical applications. For example, the oxidation of <i>rac</i>-bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-6-one, whose oxidized product is a chiral building block for the synthesis of prostaglandins, was performed at a 200 L scale using whole cells expressing a cyclohexanone monooxygenase from <i>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus </i> NCIMB 9871 (AcCHMO; EC 1.14.13.22). <sup> <a href="#ref11">11</a> </sup> BVMOs have also successfully been identified as relevant industrial biocatalysts for the enantioselective sulfoxidation of two key intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. <sup> <a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a> </sup> The BVMO-catalyzed synthesis of a chiral sulfoxide drug intermediate at kilogram scale was recently reported. <sup> <a href="#ref14">14</a> </sup> Moreover, BVMO-catalyzed synthesis of lactones, which are relevant building blocks for polymers, has been applied at smaller laboratory scales. For example, poly(ε-caprolactone) was synthesized from 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid prepared at a multidozen gram scale in a fed-batch biocatalyzed reactor. <sup> <a href="#ref15">15</a> </sup> ε-Caprolactone, which is another precursor of this polyester, was prepared from a convergent cascade in a biphasic system combining AcCHMO with an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). <sup> <a href="#ref16">16</a> </sup> The same lactone was similarly obtained by using whole cells expressing AcCHMO at a 3 L scale, resulting in a moderate productivity of 0.79 g L <sup>–1</sup> h <sup>−1</sup>. <sup> <a href="#ref17">17</a> </sup> At the same scale, cyclododecanone was oxidized to the corresponding macrolactone using recombinant <i>Escherichia coli</i> whole cells expressing a cyclopentadecanone monooxygenase from <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain HI-70 (PsCPDMO; EC 1.14.13). <sup> <a href="#ref18">18</a> </sup> The multidozen-gram-scale synthesis of a nitrile ε-caprolactone derivative, which is a Nylon-9 precursor, was performed using PsCPDMO in whole cells with substrate feeding product removal. <sup> <a href="#ref19">19</a> </sup> </p> <p>However, several factors hinder the application of BVMOs at industrial scale, namely, poor stability toward organic solvents, poor thermostability, and regeneration of their NAD(P)H cofactor. Thermostability and resistance to organic solvents can be improved by careful choice of the biocatalyst. For example, a cyclohexanone monooxygenase from <i>Thermocrispum municipale </i> DSM 44069 (TmCHMO; EC 1.14.13.22) has recently been discovered, which outperforms most wild-type CHMOs in terms of thermostability with a melting temperature of 48 °C <sup> <a href="#ref20">20</a> </sup> (see the recent review on protein engineering <sup> <a href="#ref7">7</a> </sup> for a comparison of <i>T</i> <sub>m</sub> values). This enzyme is particularly suitable for the application of BVMOs to the synthesis of lactone polymeric building blocks given its broad substrate scope toward branched cyclic ketones. <sup> <a href="#ref21">21</a> </sup> TmCHMO has already been engineered into a fusion protein, forming a self-sufficient system for NADPH cofactor regeneration. For example, a TmCHMO–ADH fusion biocatalyst enables the cascade oxidation of cyclohexanol to ε-caprolactone. <sup> <a href="#ref22">22</a> </sup> Recently, we have similarly applied a TmCHMO–PTDH fusion protein as a self-sufficient biocatalyst, in which a phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) uses phosphite as a sacrificial cosubstrate. <sup> <a href="#ref23">23</a> </sup> Additionally, we have found that several water-miscible cosolvents are compatible with this enzyme, with good retention of substrate conversion. <sup> <a href="#ref23">23</a> </sup> This enables increased product concentration, which is typically achieved in successful biocatalyzed reactions operating at large scale. <sup> <a href="#ref2">2</a> </sup> </p> <p>In this work, our goal was to optimize the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone ( <b>1</b>) ( <a href="#sch1">Scheme </a><a href="#sch1">1</a> ). This substrate can be prepared by hydrogenation of isophorone, which is obtained from the self-condensation of acetone, potentially sourced from renewables via acetone–butanol–ethanol (A-B-E) fermentation of ligno-cellulosic feedstocks. <sup> <a href="#ref24">24</a>− <a href="#ref26">26</a> </sup> The two regioisomeric lactones resulting from the oxidation of <b>1</b>, i.e., β,β,δ-trimethyl-ε-caprolactone and β,δ,δ-trimethyl-ε-caprolactone (TMCL), are attracting attention in the field of polymers. <sup> <a href="#ref27">27</a>− <a href="#ref29">29</a> </sup> </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 1</span> </a> </div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

While BVMO-catalyzed oxidations favor the distal lactone, the chemical Baeyer–Villiger oxidation favors the formation of the proximal lactone ( <b>1a</b>: <b>1b</b> = 55:45 and 45:55, respectively). With the fused TmCHMO–PTDH biocatalyst, a biphasic system in toluene yielded a maximum product concentration of 11 g L <sup>–1</sup>. With the same self-sufficient biocatalyst, continuous substrate feeding (CSF) afforded a maximum productivity of 1.20 g L <sup>–1</sup> h <sup>–1</sup> with a limited product concentration of 7 g L <sup>–1</sup>. In order to improve the TmCHMO-catalyzed oxidation of <b>1</b> toward upscaling, high productivity and product concentration were targeted while maintaining a low biocatalyst loading. To this end, TmCHMO was applied in a two-enzyme system with a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to regenerate the NADPH cofactor using (+)-glucose as a cosubstrate ( <a href="#sch2">Scheme </a><a href="#sch2">2</a> b). CSF was selected as the substrate supply method in order to keep the substrate concentration below the inhibitory level. The effects of biocatalyst loading and oxygen input on the reaction progress were evaluated, since they can also increase the overall productivity. CSF was further optimized by varying the feeding rate, total amount of added substrate, and total reaction time. The best reaction conditions were subsequently evaluated against two biphasic systems using either <i>n</i>-butyl acetate or toluene as the water-immiscible organic phase. Finally, the CSF biocatalyzed reaction was scaled to a total volume of 500 mL to yield the regioisomeric lactones at a gram scale. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 2</span> </a> </div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Results and Discussion</div> <p>In order to increase the productivity of the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone, several parameters were investigated, namely, the biocatalyst loading and the oxygen input via the stirring rate and the air flow rate. For this reaction, control of the pH is essential since GDH was selected as the coenzyme to regenerate the NADPH cofactor. In this case, for each molecule of converted substrate, one molecule of gluconic acid is formed as a result of the spontaneous hydrolysis of the coproduct <div class="sc_UNKNOWN">
d</div>-gluconolactone, causing a drop in the pH throughout the reaction ( <a href="#sch2">Scheme </a><a href="#sch2">2</a> b). The pH of the reaction was therefore maintained at 8 by autotitration. Because of the limited water solubility of the substrate (about 4 g L <sup>–1</sup> in buffer), the use of a cosolvent is necessary to solubilize it at high concentration. We have previously shown that the cosolvent influences the reaction rate, with methanol giving the fastest conversion. <sup> <a href="#ref23">23</a> </sup> For this reason, methanol was selected as the cosolvent. </p> <div class="biocatalystloading" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Biocatalyst Loading </div> <p>The stability of the TmCHMO biocatalyst was evaluated by performing bioconversions with decreasing biocatalyst loading. These reactions were performed in a fed-batch manner, meaning that about 10 mM substrate was added stepwise every hour. This time interval was chosen to give the biocatalyst enough time to fully convert the substrate, so that no substrate accumulation was observed. Under these hourly substrate additions, the reaction progress of the bioconversions was found to be independent of the decrease in the biocatalyst loading over the range from 10% v v <sup>–1</sup> to 1.25% v v <sup>–1</sup> TmCHMO ( <a href="#fig1">Figure </a><a href="#fig1">1</a> a–d). For all of the reactions, the substrate was fully converted within 1 h, independent of the TmCHMO concentration. This indicates good stability of the enzyme, at least within the time frame of the reaction. Moreover, the product accumulation as measured in the aqueous phase followed the total amount of substrate fed, indicating good efficiency of the enzyme. Interestingly, it was observed that the substrate acted as an antifoaming agent, with foaming observed only when no more substrate was available in the reaction mixture. As long as substrate was present, foaming was almost suppressed, preventing the possible air–protein interphase pathway of protein deactivation from taking place. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Concentrations of substrate and product as functions of time for increasing TmCHMO biocatalyst loading.

On the basis of the full conversion of 10 mM substrate observed at all biocatalyst loadings, a substrate feeding rate of at least 10 mM h <sup>–1</sup> seems to be appropriate. </p> </div> <div class="oxygenmasstransferlimitations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Oxygen Mass Transfer Limitations </div> <p>In BVMO-catalyzed oxidations, the oxygen supply is critical since molecular oxygen is one of the reactants. The solubility of molecular oxygen in aqueous solutions at atmospheric pressure is very low (about 0.3 mM), while it is usually higher in organic solvents. <sup> <a href="#ref30">30</a> </sup> However, the solubility of oxygen in a mixture of 20% methanol in water (0.34 mM) is not significantly increased compared with that in water only. <sup> <a href="#ref30">30</a> </sup> It is therefore important to identify oxygen mass transfer limitations since they can limit the reaction productivity and therefore the overall process performance. The oxygen transfer rate is influenced by the size of the gas bubbles in the reaction mixture. The effects of the stirring rate and air flow rate, which are two factors impacting the amount of dissolved oxygen, on the progress of the reaction were evaluated ( <a href="#fig2">Figure </a><a href="#fig2">2</a> a). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span> </a> </div>   <p>(a) Substrate conversion and (b) product concentration as functions of time with increasing stirring and air flow rates.

However, the stirring rate of 1000 rpm led to the observation of a significant amount of denatured protein. This was attributed to the increased air–aqueous solution interface, which is detrimental to the activity of the protein. Increasing the stirring rate and/or air flow rate resulted in similar mass balance for all reactions, indicating that there was no removal of substrate or product from the reaction mixture through the air stream ( <a href="#fig2">Figure </a><a href="#fig2">2</a> b). The optimal reaction conditions for this reaction were thus identified to be an air flow rate of 16 mL min <sup>–1</sup> and a stirring rate of 500 rpm. </p> </div> <div class="increasingproductconcentrationwithcontinuoussubstratefeeding" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Increasing Product Concentration with Continuous Substrate Feeding</div> <p>In order for the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation to be competitive against classical chemical Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, it is necessary to achieve high product concentrations, typically exceeding 10 g L <sup>–1</sup>. Continuous substrate feeding (CSF) was therefore selected as a suitable substrate supply strategy in order to keep the substrate concentration low and thus avoid substrate inhibition. Potential product inhibition was evaluated by performing a reaction containing the chemically synthesized lactones at an initial concentration of 30 mM (approximately 4.7 g L <sup>–1</sup>) ( <a href="#fig3">Figure </a><a href="#fig3">3</a> ). While the initial presence of product at 30 mM did not seem to hamper product accumulation, it did result in lower substrate accumulation, maybe as a result of better solubility of the substrate in the aqueous phase due to the presence of the product. Under these reaction conditions, no product inhibition was observed at product concentrations lower than 30 mM. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 3</span> </a> </div>   <p>Concentrations of substrate and product as functions of time in the absence of initial product (solid symbols) and with an initial product concentration of 30 mM (open symbols).

In the case of this reaction, a reaction rate of 15 mM h <sup>–1</sup> was favored, as the final product concentration was higher with a similar conversion. On the basis of the reaction progress observed at various TmCHMO loadings ( <a href="#fig1">Figure </a><a href="#fig1">1</a> ), an initial biocatalyst loading of 2.5% v v <sup>–1</sup> was selected. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 4</span> </a> </div>   <p>Effects of CSF rates of 10 and 15 mM h <sup>–1</sup> on (a) concentration of substrate (left axis) and substrate conversion (right axis) and (b) concentration of product.

This was not the case, however, as the reaction suffered from significant substrate accumulation, up to about 95 mM (about 15 g L <sup>–1</sup>). As expected, increasing the reaction time increased the amount of protein denaturation observed. Interestingly, the same overnight CSF resulted in almost no substrate accumulation when the reactor was loaded with 5% v v <sup>–1</sup> biocatalyst instead of 2.5% v v <sup>–1</sup>, with the conversion increasing from 42% to 85%.

Continuous Substrate Feeding versus Biphasic Systems in Organic Solvents </div> <p>This improved CSF reaction was evaluated against another substrate supply strategy, namely, a biphasic system using either toluene or <i>n</i>-butyl acetate.

Toluene was selected because of the favorable solvent resistance of TmCHMO toward this solvent (no significant decrease in activity for the oxidation of cyclohexanone at 30 °C in the presence of 33% v v <sup>–1</sup> toluene). <sup> <a href="#ref23">23</a> </sup> <i>n</i>-Butyl acetate was selected as a low-environmental-impact alternative. <sup> <a href="#ref31">31</a> </sup> Additionally, both solvents have a low solubility in water, which should result in clear partitioning of the substrate and product, and a high boiling point, which should circumvent any potential evaporation that might occur over time. </p> <p>A biphasic system consisting of 25% v v <sup>–1</sup> organic solvent (i.e., 30 mL of aqueous phase with 10 mL of organic phase) was loaded with 7.2 mmol of substrate (1.138 mL), corresponding to the same amount of substrate that was converted in the optimized CSF system.

During the reaction, the substrate was found almost exclusively in the organic phase along with the formed product ( <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</a> b,d vs a,c). However, it was difficult to follow the reaction progress of each phase because of the significant emulsification that occurred. It is therefore probable that the amounts of substrate and product measured in the (lower) aqueous phase were overestimated because of contamination with the (upper) organic phase while the amounts in the organic phase were probably underestimated because of the emulsification. This is particularly visible with the sudden drop in the product concentration in the toluene phase between 23 and 25 h ( <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S1b</a>), which was due to samples of the reaction mixture containing a mixture of the two phases. </p> <p>At the end of the reaction (26.5 h), the reaction mixture was diluted with additional organic solvent in order to deactivate all of the remaining protein. This resulted in almost full solubility of the substrate and product in the organic phase (&amp;gt;98%). Analysis of the isolated products revealed that both biphasic systems displayed lower substrate conversion than the equivalent CSF reaction, with 32% and 43% of initial substrate recovered for the toluene and <i>n</i>-butyl acetate systems, respectively. In contrast, the products isolated from the improved CSF reaction contained only 4% of the ketone, with a substrate conversion of 85% ( <a href="#fig7">Figure </a><a href="#fig7">7</a> ). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 7</span> </a> </div>   <p>Compositions of the isolated products, as analyzed by GC-FID, of the reactions performed with CSF at 15 mM h <sup>–1</sup> or in a biphasic system with <i>n</i>-butyl acetate or toluene.

Gram-Scale Preparation of Branched Lactones </div> <p>The best reaction conditions obtained using CSF were scaled up to 500 mL (the reaction setup is shown in <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</a>). The substrate was fed at a rate of 15 mM h <sup>–1</sup> for 16 h, after which the reaction was left running. Unlike with the equivalent 30 mL-scale experiment, a large amount of unreacted substrate (27% of the total amount of substrate fed) was present in the reaction mixture after 19 h ( <a href="#fig5">Figure </a><a href="#fig5">5</a> b vs <a href="#fig8">Figure </a><a href="#fig8">8</a> a). This was attributed to the occurrence of significant protein denaturation during the upscaled reaction, which might be due to increased gas–aqueous interphase. An additional 2.5% v v <sup>–1</sup> loading of TmCHMO biocatalyst was therefore added, resulting in instantaneous substrate conversion until almost all of the substrate was fully converted (&amp;gt;99% conversion). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 8</span> </a> </div>   <p>Scaled-up biocatalyzed reaction at 500 mL: (a) concentrations of substrate and product as functions of time with a substrate feeding rate of 15 mM h <sup>–1</sup>; (b) composition of the isolated products as analyzed by GC-FID (0.2% ketone <b>1</b>, 93.0% lactones <b>1a</b> and <b>1b</b>, and 6.8% methyl esters <b>1a′</b> and <b>1b′</b>).

This extra biocatalyst loading resulted in a lower biocatalyst yield compared with the smaller-scale reaction. It should be noted that the product concentration measured in the aqueous phase reached saturation at about 15 g L <sup>–1</sup> and was therefore not representative of the real total product concentration of the reaction, which was about 38 g L <sup>–1</sup>. Increasing the reaction volume resulted in an increase in isolated yield, with over 12 g of isolated lactone products for the 500 mL-scale reaction. The STY was therefore also calculated on the basis of the amount of isolated product. In that case, increasing the reaction volume doubled the STY as a result of the higher substrate conversion and higher isolated yield. Analysis of the denatured protein at the end of the reaction revealed that it adsorbed both products and substrate, with a mixture consisting mainly of lactone products (85%) with some substrate (12%) ( <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</a>). The isolated product additionally contained low amounts of side products that were identified by NMR analysis as the corresponding methyl ester ring-opened products ( <a href="#fig8">Figures </a><a href="#fig8">8</a> b and <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">S4</a>). A model reaction of chemically synthesized lactones in a reaction mixture of 50:50 v v <sup>–1</sup> buffer/methanol confirmed that this side-product formation was induced by the dilution of the reaction mixture with methanol to deactivate all of the remaining protein and can be avoided by direct product recovery at the end of the reaction ( <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00079/suppl_file/op8b00079_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</a>). </p> <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span>  <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Conclusions</div> <p>The goal of this work was to optimize the TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone at a small scale (30 mL reaction volume), for which the NADPH cofactor was regenerated by oxidation of (+)-glucose by a GDH. The use of isolated enzyme allowed control of the progress of the reaction. In particular, the TmCHMO biocatalyst loading could be reduced by almost a factor 10, to only 1.25% v v <sup>–1</sup> enzyme, without any loss of activity during fed-batch experiments. Similarly, the GDH concentration could be reduced by a factor 10 during the same fed-batch experiments. Possible oxygen limitation was investigated by changing the amount of dissolved oxygen present through altering the stirring rate and the air flow rate. The fastest reaction progress was obtained with an increased air flow rate and a reduced stirring rate, which also resulted in a favorable foaming reduction. </p> <p>Continuous substrate feeding (CSF) was applied to keep the substrate concentration below the inhibitory level. The feeding rate could be increased to 15 mM h <sup>–1</sup> without undesirable substrate accumulation. A substrate conversion of 85% was reached by optimizing the biocatalyst loading as well as the time of substrate feeding, yielding a product concentration above 31 g L <sup>–1</sup>. Compared with our previous results with the fused TmCHMO–PTDH biocatalyst on this substrate, the product concentration was increased by a factor 4 using TmCHMO with GDH. <sup> <a href="#ref23">23</a> </sup> The improved reaction was further evaluated against two biphasic systems, in toluene and <i>n</i>-butyl acetate, in which significant amounts of unreacted substrate were found. This was attributed to premature protein denaturation induced by foaming and increased interphase between the aqueous phase and the organic solvent. </p> <p>Finally, a product concentration of about 38 g L <sup>–1</sup> was achieved with the upscaling of the CSF reaction to 500 mL. It was necessary to increase the biocatalyst loading since unreacted substrate was observed after feeding of 240 mM substrate. In the future, this can be circumvented by employing continuous feeding of the biocatalyst throughout the reaction to ensure a constant enzymatic activity in the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, a productivity of 1.35 g L <sup>–1</sup> h <sup>–1</sup> was achieved for the first gram-scale TmCHMO-biocatalyzed oxidation of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone. Although improved, the reaction still requires development in terms of product concentration and space-time yield in order to reach the performances of large-scale biocatalyzed oxidations. Further work will investigate this reaction to demonstrate the viability of biocatalyzed oxidations for the synthesis of branched lactones for polymer applications. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
