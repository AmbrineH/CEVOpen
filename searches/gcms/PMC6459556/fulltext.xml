However, methods for high resolution mapping of PT modification level are still lacking. Here, we developed the PT-IC-seq technique, based on iodine-induced selective cleavage at PT sites and high-throughput next generation sequencing, as a mean to quantitatively characterizing the genomic landscape of PT modifications. Using PT-IC-seq we foud that most PT sites are partially modified at a lower PT frequency (&#x0003c; 5%) in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Cerro 87, and both show a heterogeneity pattern of PT modification similar to those of the typical methylation modification. Combining the iodine-induced cleavage and absolute quantification by droplet digital PCR, we developed the PT-IC-ddPCR technique to further measure the PT modification level. Consistent with the PT-IC-seq measurements, PT-IC-ddPCR analysis confirmed the lower PT frequency in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A. Our study has demonstrated the heterogeneity of PT modification in the bacterial population and we also established general tools for rigorous mapping and characterization of PT modification events at whole genome level. We describe to our knowledge the first genome-wide quantitative characterization of PT landscape and provides appropriate strategies for further functional studies of PT modification.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Phosphorothioate (PT) modification is a novel DNA modification, previous studies showed that PT modifications in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> occure at G<sub>ps</sub>AAC/G<sub>ps</sub>TTC motifs, but the modification frequency at each site are not known. In this study, we introduced two methods: PT-IC-seq, which could quantitatively characterize the genomic landscape of PT modifications; and PT-IC-ddPCR, which could measure PT modification frequency precisely. Through these two new methods, heterogeneity, an important feature of PT modification, is revealed intuitively and accurately. The modifications revealed in this study provide a basis for the final revelation of the physiological functions of PT and give valuable reference for other DNA modification studies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)</institution></funding-source><award-id>31630002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1644-9825</contrib-id><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Delin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31470183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1644-9825</contrib-id><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Delin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1644-9825</contrib-id><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Delin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31700029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Lingxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21661140002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Zixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31630002, 31470183, 31770038, 31700029 and 21661140002), the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Shanghai Pujiang Program from the Shanghai Municipal Council of Science and Technology.

PT modification was originally developed as an artificial means to stabilize oligodeoxynucleotides against nuclease degradation[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A physiological PT modification from bacterial enteropathogens <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> B7A was first identified by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis in 2007[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The physiological PT modifications are governed by a large family of five-gene clusters termed as <italic>dndA-E</italic>[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The biochemical study of PT modification revealed that PT-modifying enzymes DndACDE function as a large protein complex, with DndB actings as a negative transcriptional regulator[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many bacterial PT-modifying enzymes act in concert with and are encoded in close proximity to cognate restriction endonucleases DndFGH. PT modifications catalysed by PT-modifying enzyme protects DNA from digestion by DndFGH with which it forms a restriction-modification (R-M) system[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The novel R-M systems protect cells from invading foreign DNA similar to methylation-based R-M systems[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, more than half of all PT bacterial strains lack the <italic>dndF-H</italic> restriction system in spite of containing <italic>dndA-E</italic> and PT. The fact that many strains of bacteria lack the restriction enzyme components of a typical R-M system is consistent with the idea that PT modifications and <italic>dndA-E</italic> genes provide functions other than R-M, such as control of gene expression[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>PT modifications occur in DNA in a sequence-specific manner, the LC-MS/MS method was first applied to define the PT sequence contexts and quantify PT modifications in bacteria, and all 16 possible PT-linked dinucleotides in <italic>R</italic><sub>P</sub> configuration have been detected. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A, PT modifications occur in G<sub>ps</sub>A and G<sub>ps</sub>T (phosphorothioate-containing dinucleotides) at 370 &#x000b1; 11 and 398 &#x000b1; 17 PTs per 10<sup>6</sup> nt nucleotides, respectively[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. LC-MS/MS method utilizes the PT-induced nuclease inhibition that produces a limit digest of PT-containing dinucleotides, and thus is limited to quantitative analyses of dinucleotides such as d(G<sub>ps</sub>A) and d(G<sub>ps</sub>T) but not genomic mapping of PT modifications, termed phosphorothioatome. Recently, two sequencing technologies were applied to map bacterial phosphorothioatome: single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing and deep sequencing of iodine-induced cleavage at PT (ICDS)[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The double-stranded PT modification in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A was determined by both SMRT and ICDS to occur in the G<sub>ps</sub>AAC and G<sub>ps</sub>TTC sequence context, which is consistent with the previous observation of equimolar quantities of d(G<sub>ps</sub>A) and d(G<sub>ps</sub>T) detected in the genome by LC-MS/MS. Only 7045 &#x000b1; 470 out of 40701 possible GAAC/GTTC sites in B7A genome were detected as PT-modified in spite of the presence of the PT-dependent R-M system in this strain, indicating that the genome-wide PT distribution is partial in the B7A genome[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similar partial modification has been detected in DNA methylome, which is also been characterized as epigenetic heterogeneity[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. DNA methylation heterogeneity is widespread in organisms, which play critical roles in cell physiology, including as a source of phase variation that increase population-level phenotypic plasticity and provides opportunities to modulate transcription in response to changing environmental conditions, the colonization of animals by bacterial pathogens[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and cellular development and tumorigenesis[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we developed two techniques that provide improved resolution to observe heterogeneity of PT modifications: an iodine induced cleavage-based PT sequencing (PT-IC-seq) and an iodine induced cleavage-based PT droplet digital PCR (PT-IC-ddPCR). Our data reveal PT heterogeneity in bacteria. These characterizations of PT modification will open the door to understanding biology of this novel DNA modification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Discovery of new PT sites in bacteria genome using deep resequencing</title><p>DNA sequencing is an essential tool for biological and medical studies, and it can be used not only to determine the precise order of the four nucleotide bases in genetics, but also to analyze specific nucleotide base in epigenetics. Recently, we developed ICDS approach [<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to map PT locations in bacterial genomes based on adaptation of high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Using this approach, only 7045 &#x000b1; 470 out of 40,701 total possible PT modified sites across the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A genome were detected to be PT modified sites[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mapping the detected modification sites in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A genome showed that G<sub>ps</sub>AAC/G<sub>ps</sub>TTC distributs sporadically throughout the whole genome. Deep resequencing has been recently used for the correction of genome sequence[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], rare genetic variation[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and discovery of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For constructing more accurate high-resolution genetic map of PT sites in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A, we conducted resequencing of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A genome DNA by using ICDS approach with increasing sequencing depth. The genomic DNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A was isolated and treated with iodine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008026.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). When sequencing depth was increased to approximately 1000 &#x000d7;, 23,708 out of a total of 40,701 GAAC/GTTC sites were detected as PT modification sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008026.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008026.s003">S1 Table</xref>).

In the ICDS approach, iodine reagent was introduced to cleave DNA at G<sub>ps</sub>AAC/G<sub>ps</sub>TTC sites, and then ligated to an adaptor with specific index sequence for enriching the DNA fragments with PT modifications by PCR amplification. Since the PCR amplification step will result in enriched amplicons with PT modifications, ICDS sequencing approach can only be used for identifying PT sites but not for quantification. Based on these considerations, we developed one approach named iodine induced cleavage-based PT sequencing (PT-IC-seq) to quantitatively determine the PT modification percentage without enrichment process.

Although SMRT sequencing can distinguish modified PT from unmodified DNA and has been applied in genomic mapping of PT, the relatively high expense, low detection signals (the kinetic interpulse duration signals for PT modifications smaller than m<sup>6</sup>A signals) and the use of subjective thresholds[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have prevented its wide applications in genomic mapping of PT. Comparing to ICDS sequencing, PT-IC-seq can quantitatively map PT modifications because the ratio of a specific GAAC or GTTC sites with sequence reads at the end versus internal represents the relative PT modified to unmodified ratio, which ICDS sequencing could not do. Furthermore, the PT modification frequency of specific target sites were absolutely quantified with the PT-IC-ddPCR to confirm the results of PT-IC-seq approach. Consistent with the PT-IC-seq results, both of them identified all eight sites have similar PT frequency. The low PT frequency sites based on PT-IC-seq results were determined to be low by PT-IC-ddPCR as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008026.s011">S9 Table</xref>). PT-IC-ddPCR also showed good ability in quantifying the PT sites with low modification frequency. However, the relatively high expense and low throughput also have hindered their applications in genomic mapping of PT. Furthermore, the LC-MS/MS method developed previously, although sensitive enough to detect and accurately quantify the amount of the very low abundance of PT modifications, can only provide the overall ratio of the modification in total DNA. Therefore, PT-IC-seq method combining high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis is a powerful strategy to quantitatively map PT modification sites in bacteria genome and to explore the PT biology.</p><p>We then applied this PT-IC-seq strategy to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Cerro 87 genomic DNA and obtained genome-wide PT maps at single-nucleotide resolution that show PT heterogeneity in bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008026.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008026.s007">S5 Table</xref>). This PT heterogeneity phenomenon in bacterial populations is similar to recent observation of DNA methylation abundance in several distinct prokaryotes and even eukaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>Chromohalobacter salexigens</italic>, <italic>Geobacter metallireducens</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, the detected m<sup>6</sup>A or m<sup>4</sup>C methylations reveal distinct types of epigenetic heterogeneity[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic>, most of the G(m<sup>6</sup>A)TC sites were partially methylated with a low percentage of methylation ratio (below 10%)[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given the fact that solitary PT-modifying enzyme occur in more than half of all PT bacterial genome without an associated restriction enzyme component, PT heterogeneity in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B7A genome suggests that PT modification may work as an marker other than R-M system. Heterogeneity is beneficial for organisms, because it enables some cells to survive in harsh environments. When sudden changes in chemical composition [<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], local temperature [<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or other environment conditions occur, the heterogeneous population may contain some individuals that could cope with it, and thereby maintain the survival of the whole population. Hence, heterogeneity increases the overall population fitness when environmental shifts are unpredictable. As other organisms heterogeneity, PT heterogeneity may increase population-level phenotypic plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions or better preservation of certain functions of PT modification in the population to ultimately maintain the survival advantage of the population. These issues are yet to be revealed and more research is needed to answer these questions. Other than the roles of the PT heterogeneity in bacteria, the mechanism of heterogeneity for modification is also unclear. We propose two possible mechanisms for this PT heterogeneity phenomenon. One possibility is that, intracellular PT-modifying enzymes, which function as a large protein complex[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], could keep at a low activity level. The other possibility is that endogenous oxidants, metals or alkylating agents result in nonspecific desulfuration of PT modified DNA[<xref rid="pgen.1008026.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we developed PT-IC-seq and PT-IC-ddPCR approaches to quantify PT modification sites in bacteria genome. With these two methods, we clearly demonstrated that the widespread PT modification has heterogeneity in bacterial population which has important implications for the future study of PT modification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Materials and bacterial strains</title><p>The following materials were obtained from Sangon Biotech Co.
