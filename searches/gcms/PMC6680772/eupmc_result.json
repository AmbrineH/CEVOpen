    "The chemical composition of essential oils extracted from aerial parts of Eryngium campestre collected in 37 localities from Western Algeria was characterized using GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. Altogether, 52 components, which accounted for 70.1 to 86.8% of the total composition oils were identified. The main compounds were Germacrene D (0.4-53.4%), Campestrolide (1.6-35.3%), Germacrene B (0.2-21.5%), Myrcene (0.1-8.4%), α-Cadinol (0.2-7.6%), Spathulenol (0.1-7.6%), Eudesma-4(15)-7-dien-1-β-ol (0.1-7.6%) and τ-Cadinol (0.3-5.5%). The chemical compositions of essential oils obtained from separate organs and during the complete vegetative cycle of the plant were also studied. With the uncommon 17-membered ring lactone named Campestrolide as the main component, Algerian E. campestre essential oils exhibited a remarkable chemical composition. A study of the chemical variability using statistical analysis allowed the discrimination of two main clusters according to the geographical position of samples. The study contributes to the better understanding of the relationship between the plant and its environment. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was assessed against twelve strains bacteria and two yeasts involved in foodborne and nosocomial infections using paper disc diffusion and dilution agar assays. The in vitro study demonstrated a strong activity against Gram-positive strains such as S. aureus, B. cereus, and E. faecalis. The cytotoxicity and antiparasitic activities (on Lmm and Tbb) of the collective essential oil and one sample rich in campestrolide, as well as some enriched fractions or fractions containing other terpenic compounds, were also analyzed. Campestrolide seems to be one compound responsible for the cytotoxic and antileishmanial effect, while myrcene or/and trans-β-farnesene have a more selective antitrypanosomal activity."
