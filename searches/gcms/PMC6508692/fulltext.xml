To reduce natural resource utilization in Japan, artificial hormonal induction of maturation and fertilization in the Japanese eel has been intensively studied. Recent experiment on feminized (by feeding a commercial diet containing estradiol-17&#x003b2; for first half year) cultured female eels have shown ovulation problems, which is seldom observed in captured wild female eels. Therefore, the aim of this study is to try to investigate causes of ovulation problem frequently seen in cultured female eels by comparative trans-omics analyses. The omics data showed low growth hormone and luteinizing hormone transcription levels in the brain and low sex hormone&#x02013;binding globulin transcription levels in the liver of the cultured female eels. In addition, it was found that high accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and, maltose in the liver of the cultured female eel. It was also found that docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) ratios in cultured female eels were quite different from wild female eels. The data suggested that ovulation problem in cultured female eels was possibly resulted from prolonged intake of a high-carbohydrate diet and/or suboptimal DHA/EPA/ARA ratios in a diet.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="7"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The sequence data was deposited into DDBJ sequence read archive.

The seed used in its cultivation is taken from wild glass eels captured from estuaries. However, as the glass eel arrival has been drastically dropped since 1970s, eel seed depletion has become a serious problem not only in Japan but also in other East Asian countries. To reduce natural resource utilization in Japan, artificial breeding techniques of eels have been studied, and rearing methods of eel leptocephali have been developed [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Cultured female and male eels do not mature sexually in captive conditions. Therefore, weekly injection of salmon pituitary extract (SPE) is administrated to captured wild female eels, acclimated to seawater, to induce oocyte maturation [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When the body weight of female increased by 10% from the start of weekly injection of SPE (after 10&#x02013;15 injections of SPE) 17&#x003b1;-hydroxyprogesterone is injected to induce final oocyte maturation and ovulation [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To induce maturation of male eels, recombinant eel luteinizing hormone is used (human chorionic gonadotropin was used in the past [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p><p>The matured female and male eels are then transferred to a tank. When water temperature is raised from 20&#x000b0;C to 22&#x000b0;C, spawning takes place early in the morning. The Japanese eel has gymnovarian&#x02013;type ovaries, which lack a part of the ovarian capsule; therefore, ovulated eggs are discharged into the abdominal cavity once and then spawned through the genital pore [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. About 0.3&#x02013;1.0 million fertilized eggs can be collected from one wild female eel by using this method.</p><p>In the recent year, feminized (by feeding a commercial diet containing estradiol-17&#x003b2; for the first half year) cultured female eels have been used on an experimental basis to reduce natural resource utilization. It has become possible to obtain fertilized eggs from cultured female eels. However, it has been observed that in cultured female eels, the genital pore is clogged with ovarian fragment during artificial spawning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209063.g001">Fig 1</xref>), therefore, normal release of eggs is severely disrupted. Anatomical observations have shown that many unovulated eggs remained in the ovary and ovarian fragment hypertrophy in cultured female eels after artificial spawning, compared to fully ovulated eggs in wild female eels. In 2015&#x02013;2016, in 28.9% (39/135) of cultured female eels, the genital pore was clogged and more than 50-g eggs (approximately 2000 eggs/g) remained in the abdomen while in 1.6% (1/61) of wild female eels, the genital pore was clogged after artificial spawning. Furthermore, the average number of spawned eggs and the quality of fertilized eggs (e.g. fertilization, hatching, larval survival, and larval malformation rates) in cultured female eels were lower than wild female eels. It has been reported that in cultured female eels, serum estradiol-17&#x003b2; and 11-ketosterone levels and transcription levels of receptors for luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were increased during late stage of artificial oocyte maturation [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209063.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lipid contents of liver also increased during late stage of artificial oocyte maturation, while lipid contents of ovary increased until mid-vitellogenic stage, and the decreased toward ovulation in both cultured and wild female eels [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings indicated that in cultured female eel, there are problems with ovulation rather than oocyte maturation, but the reason is unclear. Hence, it is hypothesized that the physiological status of the eels just before hormone injection was the reason for this difference since artificial induction of oocyte maturation method was common between cultured and wild female eels.</p><fig id="pone.0209063.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0209063.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Clogged oviduct after hormone-induced spawning in cultured eel.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0209063.g001"/></fig><p>In this study, we examined the differences between cultured and wild female eels using combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, also called trans-omics analysis. New omics technologies have already been applied to aquaculture study [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In comparison with wild female eels, cultured female eels showed quite different hormonal and nutritional status just before the beginning of induction of artificial oocyte maturation. These differences that will be clarified from this study would serve as keys to improving ovulation problems in cultured female eels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional procedures of the National Research Institute of Aquaculture guidelines.

Afterwards, 5 eels were randomly selected and transferred to a 2-kL semi-intensive tank filled with seawater, and the water temperature was gradually decreased from 26&#x000b0;C to 20&#x000b0;C (at the rate of 1.5&#x000b0;C /day).

Interestingly, studies of the Asian catfish have demonstrated that an injection of GH in the morning during the early recrudescence phase induced an appreciable increase in ovarian weight and the GSI [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the present study, the ovarian weight and GSI of cultured female eels were found to be lower than those of wild female eels. Our RNA-seq-based transcriptomic analysis data indicate recognizable transcription of <italic>gh receptor 1</italic>, <italic>gh receptor 2</italic>, and <italic>gh-releasing hormone receptor</italic>. However, the transcription levels of gonadotropin receptors were very low. Studies of the Japanese eel have reported changes in gonadotropin receptors in the ovaries during hormone-induced oocyte maturation [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During the late vitellogenic stage, transcription levels of <italic>luteinizing hormone receptor</italic> in the ovaries increase. Taken together, these results indicated that compared to low <italic>lh</italic> levels, low <italic>gh</italic> levels mainly influence lower ovarian weight in cultured female eels. Furthermore, it is well known that GH production presents daily rhythms. Although there were no differences between the cultured and wild female eels in the expression levels of circadian rhythms and clock genes, including of period, timeless, clock, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like, or melatonin receptors in the brains, further confirmation is necessary to examine whether circadian rhythms in cultured female eels are disturbed.</p><p>The metabolomic analysis using GC/MS showed an intense accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and maltose in the liver of cultured female eels, whereas there was no significant difference in the serum glucose levels between the cultured and wild female eels.

It has been reported that wild eels in rivers prey on mud shrimp and crayfish [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These data suggest that the accumulated glucose-6-phosphate and maltose found in the liver of cultured female eels were mainly derived from starch in the commercial diet and that cultured female eels have a higher intake of carbohydrate than wild female eels. In teleosts, unlike in mammals, amino acids play a more significant role than glucose in insulin secretion [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209063.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and teleosts have generally been considered to be glucose intolerant [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, in angler fish, glucose stimulates insulin and somatostatin-14 production, which suppress GH secretion, and inhibits glucagon secretion [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, simultaneously injecting arginine and glucose into European eels, resulted in greater insulin secretion stimulation than injecting either factor alone [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The high insulin level probably suppresses the release of glucose and promotes glucose storage. These results indicate that cultured female eels can experience hyperinsulinemia, in addition to significantly high serum triglyceride levels. Studies are needed to measure serum insulin levels in cultured female eels. The commercial diet which contains a high-carbohydrate have been used exclusively in the studies of cultured female eels since the establishment of feminization (by feeding a commercial diet containing estradiol-17&#x003b2; for the first 5&#x02013;6 months), however, these results also indicated that a high-carbohydrate diet is not suitable for eel broodstock culture.</p><p>The transcriptomic analysis also demonstrated that <italic>shbg</italic> transcription levels in the liver were low in cultured female eels. In mammals, it is thought that GH pulsatility and thyroid hormone enhance SHBG transcription <italic>via</italic> hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF4a) [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209063.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These data suggest that both <italic>gh</italic> transcription and GH secretion are lower in cultured female eels compared to wild female eels, although no significant difference between the two eel groups was observed in the transcription levels of <italic>insulin-like growth factor I</italic> (<italic>igf1</italic>) in the liver. Previously, hepatic IGF1 expression was thought to be fully dependent on GH. However, studies in humans have reported that the total serum IGF1 concentration did not significantly differ between obese and control groups despite GH hyposecretion in obese people [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, glucose and insulin can also promote IGF1 expression in fetal rat hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These data indicate that GH and IGF1 levels are not always correlated.</p><p>Characterization of Shbg in the Japanese eel has previously been reported [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], including a high affinity to E2, androstenediol, and T. In the past, SHBG was thought to regulate the free concentration of the steroids that bind to it, but a recent study found that although cell membranes have a receptor for SHBG, the receptor has not been cloned; the receptor binds unliganded SHBG and the SHBG-receptor complex is activated by an agonist steroid to initiate the generation of cAMP [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It has been demonstrated in European eels that there is E2-specific positive feedback with LH expression and T-specific negative feedback with FSH expression during ovarian development [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In contrast, the present study found no interaction between serum E2 levels and LH transcription levels or between serum T levels and FSH transcription levels. However, it is possible that Shbg is involved in feedback gonadotropin secretion by steroids. It has also been suggested that in mammals, GH may influence reproductive activity by increasing the secretion of gonadotropin at the hypothalamic and pituitary level and by enhancing the response to gonadotropins at the gonadal level [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Confirmation in cultured female eels is needed regarding whether decreased transcription of <italic>gh</italic> and <italic>shbg</italic> levels affects the secretion of gonadotropins through the modulation of steroid signals and gonadal responsiveness to gonadotropin.</p><p>In humans, lower GH and SHBG levels are also associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), characterized by menstrual abnormalities, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperandrogenism [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We therefore, examined whether hyperandrogenic symptoms were exhibited by the cultured female eels. The marker genes, which were selected on the basis of transcriptomic analysis results comparing wild female and wild male brains, initially showed sex-dependent expression. As described earlier, <italic>sl</italic> and <italic>cyp19a1</italic> were selected as highly expressed genes in female eels, and <italic>jumonji</italic> was selected as a highly expressed gene in male eels. Unexpectedly, we did not observe any hyperandrogenic symptoms resulting from the low <italic>shbg</italic> levels in cultured female eels. Although the <italic>shbg</italic> transcription levels were lower in the cultured female eels than in the wild female eels, there was no significant difference in serum steroid hormone levels between the two eel groups. However, circulating T levels tended to be lower in the cultured female eels, and the level of the hepatic <italic>akr1d1</italic> mRNA was significantly higher. The steroid 5&#x003b2;-reductase Akr1d1, is responsible for the conversion of T to 5&#x003b2;-dihydrotestosterone [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This is not believed to be an active androgen [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and its synthesis from T by Akr1d1 may be a process to eliminate excess T [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggest that, in cultured female eels, increased free T undergoes clearance in the liver through sequential reduction by Akr1d, and it is possible that up-regulation of <italic>akr1d1</italic> prevented hyperandrogenism in the cultured female eels. Several symptoms in the cultured female eels, other than hyperandrogenism, showed a similarity to human PCOS, such as the lower <italic>gh</italic> and <italic>shbg</italic> transcription levels and ovulation problems. Further studies are required to investigate the effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on the transcription of <italic>gh</italic> and <italic>shbg</italic> and serum insulin levels during artificial oocyte maturation to confirm whether fish, like mammals, can develop PCOS.</p><p>Serum 11-KT, a major androgen in the Japanese eel, was slightly but not significantly higher in the wild female eels. The transcription level of <italic>11&#x003b2; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase short form</italic> (<italic>11&#x003b2;-hsdsf</italic>), which catalyzes 11&#x003b2;-hydroxytestosterone to 11-KT and cortisol to cortisone [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], was also higher in the liver of the wild female eels than in those of the cultured female eels. Thus, high serum 11-KT levels in wild female eels may be associated with higher <italic>11&#x003b2;-hsdsf</italic> transcription in the liver.</p><p>Although hyperandrogenic symptoms were not observed in the cultured female eels, there were significant sex differences in gene expression in their brains. As expected, the expression level of <italic>cyp19a1</italic> (also called <italic>aromatase</italic>), was higher in female eel; however, it was unclear why the levels of <italic>sl</italic> were also higher in the female eels. Several studies of the Japanese eel have reported that the number of anti-Sl-positive cells in the pituitary gradually increased during artificial oocyte maturation until the late vitellogenic stage, and then decreased during the migratory nucleus stage [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It has also been shown that the relative mRNA levels of <italic>sl</italic> in the pituitary of blue gourami (<italic>Trichogaster trichopterus</italic>) gradually decreased during oocyte maturation [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These findings suggest that Sl plays a role in oocyte maturation. Many JUMONJI family proteins have domains, such as ARID, jmjC, and jmjN, that are involved in DNA binding, chromatin binding, and transcription, which suggests that JUMONJI family proteins regulate transcription or chromatin function or both [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The transcriptomic analysis in the present study showed that mRNA expression levels of the four <italic>jumonji</italic> family genes were higher in the brain of the male eels. All four genes contained ARID, jmjC, and/or jmjN domains. Interestingly, studies using human cell lines have demonstrated that JMDM2A, a jmjC-containing histone H3 lysine 9 demethylase, interacts directly with the androgen receptor and is used in a hormone-dependent manner in androgen receptor target genes in order to mediate transcription activation [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These findings suggest that <italic>jumonji</italic> family genes may contribute to sex differences in the brains of the Japanese eels.</p><p>The transcriptomic analysis also showed that apoptosis-associated genes, such as <italic>small nuclear ribonucleoprotein F</italic>, <italic>tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19</italic>, <italic>cytochrome c</italic>, and <italic>granzyme K</italic>, were highly expressed in the ovaries of the cultured female eels and that <italic>cytochrome c</italic> was highly expressed in the livers [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209063.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. TUNEL assay found apoptotic cells only in interstitial cells of the ovary of the cultured female eels. These data suggest that the caspase-independent pathway of programmed cell death occurs in ovaries of the cultured female eels. Many reports have shown that GH suppresses apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Taken together, these findings indicated that impaired GH secretion is likely to induce apoptosis in the ovaries, and probably the liver, of cultured female eels. Steroid- producing cells (SPCs) have been observed in the interstitial area of fish ovaries and SPCs migrate into thecal layer enclosing vitellogenic oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It is well known that apoptosis in theca-interstitial cells mediates post-ovulatory follicular absorption [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], however, it is still unclear whether apoptosis mediates ovarian follicular atresia, which is common phenomenon in teleosts, during pre-spawning period [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209063.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. These data indicated that increased apoptotic cells in interstitial area may affect steroid production, follicular growth and development, and oocyte maturation in cultured female eels.</p><p>Trans-omics analysis reveals &#x0201c;the big picture&#x0201d; and provides other insights. In this study, &#x003b1;-tocopherol accumulation was found in the livers, ovaries, and serum of cultured female eels. Previous studies have reported that excess &#x003b1;-tocopherol induces tocopherol radicals and oxidizes ascorbic acid to reduce oxidized tocopherol [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Oxidized ascorbic acid, also called dehydroascorbic acid, is degraded to threonic acid and oxalic acid [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In cultured female eels, the metabolomic analysis showed high levels of oxalic acid in the ovaries and high levels of oxalic acid and threonic acid in the serum. These data indicate that the cultured female eels had consumed excessive amount of &#x003b1;-tocopherol. The metabolomic analysis also revealed differences between cultured and wild female eels in the DHA/EPA/ARA ratio in all the examined samples. The cultured female eels in this study were fed a diet supplemented with cod liver oil (<xref rid="pone.0209063.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This contains greater amount of DHA and EPA than of ARA [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], suggesting that the dietary DHA/EPA/ARA ratio affected the tissue DHA/EPA/ARA ratio in these eels. It has been reported that eggs from cultured Japanese eels have lower ARA levels than those from wild eels [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In addition, several studies have reported that the DHA/EPA/ARA ratio in fish ovaries or eggs strongly influenced the quality of the eggs and larvae [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. ARA is the precursor to biologically active eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, which are involved in many aspects of reproduction in teleosts including reproductive behavior and ovulation [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209063.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. EPA and ARA compete for the enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis of eicosanoids; further studies are therefore required to investigate the optimal dietary DHA/EPA/ARA ratio for reproductive performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, that trans-omics analysis indicated that the ovulation problem, often observed in cultured female eels may be the result of a high-carbohydrate diet and/or a suboptimal DHA/EPA/ARA ratio in their diet. Interactions between nutrition and reproductive performance have been reported in domesticated animals [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and poor reproductive performance has been reported in cultured broodstock compared to wild fish for several fish species [<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209063.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The commercial diet for fish is generally designed to promote weight gain and/or fleshing out, regardless of the fecundity of the fish, and an optimized diet for broodstock culture is not commercially available. Future studies should therefore investigate more extensively the effect of diet on the reproductive performance of fish. The findings of the present study suggested several future experimental directions for the improvement of seed production efficiency, including establishing the effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on GH secretion, the effects of impaired GH secretion on the responsiveness to gonadotropins, the effects of lower Shbg levels on oocyte maturation, and the optimal dietary DHA/EPA/ARA ratios. The comprehensive data obtained in this study also demonstrated the usefulness of the omics approaches for understanding the functionality of diet components in aquaculture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209063.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primer and probe sequences for RT-qPCR, and PCR efficiencies.</title><p>Primer and probe sequences for RT-qPCR in this research, and PCR efficiencies (%).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209063.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209063.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of gene expression in the livers.</title><p>List of the significant differentially expressed genes in wild and cultured female eel liver obtained from our RNA-seq data.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209063.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209063.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of gene expression in the ovaries.</title><p>List of significant differentially expressed genes in the ovaries of wild and cultured female eels.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209063.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209063.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of gene expression in the brains between wild female eel and cultured female eel.</title><p>List of significant differentially expressed genes in wild female eel brain and cultured female eel brain.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209063.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209063.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison of gene expression in the brains between wild eel female and wild male eel.</title><p>List of significant differentially expressed genes in the brains of wild female and male eels.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209063.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest associated with this manuscript.
