    "Long-term stock decline in the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) is a serious issue. To reduce natural resource utilization in Japan, artificial hormonal induction of maturation and fertilization in the Japanese eel has been intensively studied. Recent experiment on feminized (by feeding a commercial diet containing estradiol-17Î² for first half year) cultured female eels have shown ovulation problems, which is seldom observed in captured wild female eels. Therefore, the aim of this study is to try to investigate causes of ovulation problem frequently seen in cultured female eels by comparative trans-omics analyses. The omics data showed low growth hormone and luteinizing hormone transcription levels in the brain and low sex hormone-binding globulin transcription levels in the liver of the cultured female eels. In addition, it was found that high accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and, maltose in the liver of the cultured female eel. It was also found that docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) ratios in cultured female eels were quite different from wild female eels. The data suggested that ovulation problem in cultured female eels was possibly resulted from prolonged intake of a high-carbohydrate diet and/or suboptimal DHA/EPA/ARA ratios in a diet."
