    "Triacylglycerol (TG), the main component of edible oil, is oxidized by thermal- or photo- oxidation to form TG hydroperoxide (TGOOH) as the primary oxidation product. Since TGOOH and its subsequent oxidation products cause not only the deterioration of oil quality but also various toxicities, preventing the oxidation of edible oils is essential. Therefore understanding oxidation mechanisms that cause the formation of TGOOH is necessary. Since isomeric information of lipid hydroperoxide provides insights about oil oxidation mechanisms, we focused on dioleoyl-(hydroperoxy octadecadienoyl)-TG (OO-HpODE-TG) isomers, which are the primary oxidation products of the most abundant TG molecular species (dioleoyl-linoleoyl-TG) in canola oil. To secure highly selective and sensitive analysis, authentic OO-HpODE-TG isomer references (i.e., hydroperoxide positional/geometrical isomers) were synthesized and analyzed with HPLC-MS/MS. With the use of the method, photo- or thermal- oxidized edible oils were analyzed. While dioleoyl-(10-hydroperoxy-8E,12Z-octadecadienoyl)-TG (OO-(10-HpODE)-TG) and dioleoyl-(12-hydroperoxy-9Z,13E-octadecadienoyl)-TG (OO-(12-HpODE)-TG) were characteristically detected in photo-oxidized oils, dioleoyl-(9-hydroperoxy-10E,12E-octadecadienoyl)-TG and dioleoyl-(13-hydroperoxy-9E,11E-octadecadienoyl)-TG were found to increase depending on temperature in thermal-oxidized oils. These results prove that our methods not only evaluate oil oxidation in levels that are unquantifiable with peroxide value, but also allows for the determination of oil oxidation mechanisms. From the analysis of marketed canola oils, photo-oxidized products (i.e., OO-(10-HpODE)-TG and OO-(12-HpODE)-TG) were characteristically accumulated compared to the oil analyzed immediately after production. The method described in this paper is valuable in the understanding of oil and food oxidation mechanisms, and may be applied to the development of preventive methods against food deterioration."
