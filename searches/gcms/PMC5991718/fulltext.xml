A comprehensive and systematic metabolic characterization of the <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> race A strain CCAP 807/2 was conducted within the present study, including the detailed analysis of growth-associated and physiological parameters. In addition, the intracellular metabolome was profiled for the first time and showed growth- and product-specific fluctuations in response to the different availability of medium resources during the cultivation course. Among the identified metabolites, a constant expression of raffinose was observed for the first time under standard conditions, which has until now only been described for higher plants. Overall, the multilayered analysis during the cultivation of strain CCAP 807/2 allowed the differentiation of four distinct physiological growth phases and revealed differences in the production profiles and content of liquid hydrocarbons and carbohydrates with up to 84% of organic dry weight (oDW). In the process, an enhanced production of carbohydrates with up to 63% of oDW (1.36&#x000b1;0.03 g L<sup>-1</sup>) could be observed during the late linear growth phase, whereas the highest accumulation of extracellular hydrocarbons with up to 24% of oDW (0.66&#x000b1;0.12 g L<sup>-1</sup>) occurred mainly during the stationary growth phase. Altogether, the knowledge obtained is potentially useful for the general understanding of the overall physiology of <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> and provide important insights into the growth behavior and product formation of this microalga, and is thus relevant for large scale biofuel production and industrial applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)</institution></funding-source><award-id>311956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9874-382X</contrib-id><name><surname>Kruse</surname><given-names>Olaf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n&#x000b0;311956 (relating to project &#x0201c;SPLASH &#x02013; Sustainable PoLymers from Algae Sugars and Hydrocarbons&#x0201d;) to OK.

Like all microalgae, <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> is capable of the conversion of sunlight and CO<sub>2</sub> into biomass and valuable products. Because of its almost unique ability to synthesize large quantities of (exo-)polysaccharides and hydrocarbons and to secrete the latter [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], this colony forming green microalga represents a potential source for industrial applications like biofuels and other valuable chemicals [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The colonies of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> feature a unique organization with the individual cells embedded in a hydrocarbon-containing extracellular matrix (ECM), which are encapsulated in a retaining cell wall surrounded by a fibrillary sheath layer [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Based on the chemical structure of the synthesized hydrocarbons, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> is differentiated into four distinct races (race A, B, L and S) [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Race A strains of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> produce mainly C<sub>23-</sub>C<sub>33</sub> odd numbered <italic>n</italic>-alkadienes and <italic>n</italic>-alkatrienes [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], derived from fatty acid via elongation-decarboxylation pathway [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Races B and L produce isoprenoid-derived hydrocarbons: methylsqualenes and C<sub>30</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>37</sub> botryococcene triterpenoids in race B [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the C<sub>40</sub> tetraterpenoid lycopadiene in race L [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recently tentatively identified race S strains synthesize C<sub>18</sub> epoxy-<italic>n</italic>-alkanes and C<sub>20</sub> saturated <italic>n</italic>-alkanes [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The synthesized hydrocarbons accumulate likely for storage in the extracellular space, in contrast to other examined microalgae, which store lipid bodies in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> is also well known to synthesize large amounts of polysaccharides, which represent the components of the cell wall and the retaining wall/ fibrillar sheath [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The polysaccharide precursor are supposedly synthesized in the Golgi body and were proposed to be delivered via Golgi vesicles through the fenestrated ER, across the cell membrane/wall to the retaining wall and its associated fibrillar sheath [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. During the growth of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> cultures, uniform cup-shaped structures, also called &#x0201c;shells&#x0201d;, which represent excised segments of the retaining wall and its fibril sheath, are accumulating in the surrounding media and causing viscosity increase of the culture [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>However, despite the remarkable capability to synthesize and excrete industrially interesting chemicals into the extracellular matrix, the comparably slow growth rates of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic>, most likely associated with the production of high energy compounds like hydrocarbons and other polymers, challenge the marketable application of this microalga [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Many previous studies, dedicated to the determination of optimal culture conditions have clearly indicated that factors like culturing conditions and nutrient availability have drastic effects on growth and productivity performance of <italic>B</italic>.<italic>braunii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Generally, oil-accumulating microalgae produce fatty acids or triglycerides under environmental stresses such as nutrient depletion [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but the highest hydrocarbon productivity in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> has been reported to appear during the active growth phase [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, Dayananda and co-workers demonstrated significant differences of the growth-associated hydrocarbon production under varying culture media and conditions [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The production of polysaccharides has been described to occur during linear and stationary growth phases with enhanced production rates during algae growth decline phase, probably due to the development of nitrogen limitation in the culture medium [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. But above all, the performed studies have pointed out the general occurrence of huge variations in productivity (e.g. hydrocarbons and polysaccharides) and growth behavior across different races and species of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], observable even for the same stain [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For instance, <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> race A strain CCAP 807/2 was previously assessed to be of potential interest for biofuel production, because of its relatively high extractable hydrocarbon content with over 30% of dry weight (DW) in comparison to other race A strains [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. On the other hand, another recent study reported for the same strain quite contradictory results, showing either a high biomass productivity with only low hydrocarbon and polysaccharide concentrations (7% and 5% of DW, respectively) in bubble column cultivation, or <italic>vice versa</italic> in shake flasks [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, Moutel and co-workers reported an even totally diminished growth with maximal reached biomass concentrations of 0.01g L<sup>-1</sup> for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP807/2 [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this context, it is becoming obvious, that the application of different cultivation conditions and continuance, but also apparently the physiological state of the cells, have a tremendous impact on the production rates of biomass and of the product of interest.</p><p>Although, a plethora of extensive work has been performed in the past, the physiological behavior of <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> cells is still not fully understood, since focus has been mainly set on fatty acids, hydrocarbons and carbohydrates. However, an upstream investigation of metabolic pathways may reveal more insight into their regulation and provide valuable knowledge for future reasonable strain selection and optimal productivity. Metabolomics represents an important component of system biology research that can be readily used to study phenotype differences through the analysis of intra- and/or extracellular metabolites. It is a sensitive tool for the evaluation of the responses of organisms to various interferences and is considered as the endpoint of all biological processes, and thus carries the influence of all genetic and environmental factors [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, due to the discrepancy of the previous observations and limited information on the intracellular metabolome, the present study aimed to perform a comprehensive and systematic metabolic characterization of the <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> race A strain CCAP 807/2 to elucidate the impact of the physiological state of the cells on product formation.

Nevertheless, despite the constant biomass accumulation, obvious physiological changes could be observed during the cultivation period, i.e. a change of the culture color from green to pale yellowish-green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), strongly indicating different physiological growth phases of the cells [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To retrace the different growth phases of CCAP 807/2, the total chlorophyll content was used as a marker for the cell proliferation since the conventional cell count method was not suitable for this colony forming alga. The determined total chlorophyll content revealed, except for the initial period of the first three days (considered as Phase I), a gradual increase of up to 20.15&#x000b1;0.86 mg L<sup>-1</sup> on day 12, thereby indicating a linear growth phase (Phase II). The chlorophyll concentration stagnated after day 12, suggesting the onset of the stationary phase (Phase III); and finally declined steadily from day 18 to 14.19&#x000b1;1.22 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (Phase IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Additionally, this assumption was further supported by the measurements of the total protein concentration of the whole culture broth, showing a strong deceleration of the overall content after day 9 of the cultivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Since microalgae biomass usually contains high amounts of proteins [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which in turn have incorporated nitrogen, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N ratio) was determined as an indicator for the overall presence of nitrogen in the cells. The measurement of total elemental carbon and nitrogen content in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP 807/2 cell biomass revealed that the C/N ratio remained constant with a value of up to 10 between days 3&#x02013;9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), indicating that the cells did not suffer any nitrogen limitation [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The further observed gradual increase of the C/N ratio from 10.0&#x000b1;0.2 (day 9) to the value of 43.9&#x000b1;1.9 at the end of the cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), implies progressive nitrogen limitation. Additionally, the concentration measurements of the nitrogen source (KNO<sub>3</sub>) in the culture supernatant during the cultivation revealed that the major portion of nitrogen in the culture media was absorbed by the cells already after 9 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Nutrient limitation, occurring in consequence of resource depletion in the culture medium during the cultivation, is well known as a trigger for the reduction in amino acid synthesis activity, and consequently also lowers the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis activity of new proteins.

Of the sugar-related metabolites, sucrose turned out to be the most abundant component (31.1&#x000b1;0.6%) followed by some other sugar compounds such as &#x003b1;-&#x003b1;-trehalose (7.7&#x000b1;0.4%) and raffinose (7.0&#x000b1;0.8%) within the linear growth phase (Phase II). In higher plants, sucrose (&#x003b1;-D-glucopyranosyl-&#x003b2;-D-fructofuranoside), commonly known as the prime product of photosynthesis, represents the main form of translocated carbon and the main substrate for sink metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, sucrose has been reported to possess significant regulatory and integrative functions, and its metabolism is closely linked to the metabolism of inorganic and organic nitrogen, and thus may be part of a broader mechanism for balancing resource acquisition and allocation [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The disaccharide trehalose (&#x003b1;-D-glucopyranosyl-&#x003b1;-D-glucopyranoside) is, beside its main task as a storage molecule, strongly enhanced under stress conditions, playing a role as a stress-responsive factor with a bio-protective role, helping the cells to retain cellular integrity and stability [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The galactotrisaccharide raffinose is synthesized from sucrose by the subsequent addition of a activated galactose moiety donated by galactinol (1-<italic>O</italic>-&#x003b1;-D-galactopyranosyl-L-<italic>myo</italic>-inositol), which is formed by the galactinol synthase using uridine diphosphate galactose and <italic>myo</italic>-inositol as substrates [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Interestingly, the relative levels of the metabolite <italic>myo</italic>-inositol were found to be increased up to 2.7 and 4.1-fold during the Phases III and IV when compared to the levels in the linear phase (Phase II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, i; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>). This increase is in good agreement with the observed high levels of raffinose and galactinol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, i), since the reduction of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol content was reported to result in strongly reduced levels of galactinol and raffinose [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The synthesis and accumulation of raffinose and other higher molecular weight compounds from the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) has been so far exclusively reported for higher plants [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], with the only exception of a cold-stress-induced raffinose accumulation in the green alga <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to di- and oligosaccharides, monosaccharides such as glucose, arabinose, fructose and xylose were only detected during the linear growth (Phase II), except for galactose, which was found to be increased up to 5.9 and 2.3-fold, respectively, during the Phases III and IV. Another exception is galactofuranose, the five-membered ring form of galactose, which increased up to 11.5-fold during the Phase IV compared to the linear growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, i; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>). Galactofuranose has been reported to be crucial for the elaboration of the cell surface coat, since its absence often results in morphological abnormalities and an impaired cell wall function [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, the elevated levels of galactofuranose at the end of the cultivation could be due to increased incorporation of these components into the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> cell walls in order to maintain and stabilize them.</p><p>Furthermore, the identified intermediates (except glucose-6-phosphate and succinate) of the glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the citric acid cycle showed a steady decrease towards the end of the cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). An up to 2.5-fold increase of succinate during the Phase III compared to Phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, iii; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>) might serve as an indication for the up-regulated glyoxylate cycle, which provides succinate for further conversion into longer-carbon-chain compounds via gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The observed accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (up to 3.7-fold during Phase III in comparison to Phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, i; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>)), is also likely to provide NADPH as a reduction equivalent for fatty acid synthesis via its oxidation in the pentose phosphate pathway [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Moreover, the conversion of G6P to <italic>myo</italic>-inositol-1-phosphate represents the first committed step in the <italic>myo</italic>-inositol biosynthesis, a biochemical reaction involved in many aspects of organism physiology such as sugar storage and transport, carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall formation as well as stress physiology [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Overall, the high abundancy of the sugar metabolites observed during the cultivation strongly suggests that <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP807/2 produces large amounts of carbohydrates at all stages of growth, however with different consumptions and dedicated to different functions within the different growth phases.</p><p>In addition, the conducted metabolic analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the abundance of various amino acids and other related compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, ii). All identified metabolites of this specific class except for alanine, lysine and ethanolamine, decreased or could not be detected at all during the Phases III and IV in comparison to the linear growth phase (Phase II). Especially, the decrease (or absence) of proteinogenic N-rich amino acids such as glutamate, glutamine, asparagine, and arginine during the Phases III and IV might serve as a further indication for nitrogen insufficiency of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> cells in the later stages of the cultivation, as suggested above. In fact, glutamate and glutamine are well known to represent the central metabolites in the nitrogen metabolism of plants and mammalia [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A low inorganic nitrogen content in the exponential growth phase typically results in a depletion of glutamine (the first amino acid formed during ammonium assimilation) as well as in decreased levels of many other amino acids, and consequently in decreased levels of proteins and other N-containing structural components like chlorophylls [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Interestingly, the relative abundance level of ethanolamine increased drastically up to 168-fold from Phase II to Phase III and could not be detected at the end of the cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, ii; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>). Ethanolamine is well known to be essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), which represent the two major phospholipids in eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Furthermore, it was previously suggested to represent a potential marker for improving lipid accumulation since it is indirectly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis by stimulating the formation of oleic acid [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, within the metabolome analysis campesterol and &#x000df;-sitosterol were identified to represent the main sterols produced by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP 807/2 strain. This finding is in good agreement with previous reports for the three <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> races (A, B and L), synthesizing in addition to &#x000df;-sitosterol, also campesterol or stigmasterol and to a lesser extent cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although the biosynthetic pathways of the predominant membrane sterol precursors are similar in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>reinhardtii</italic>, as suggested by the transcriptome analysis of race B Showa [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], the type of sterols synthesized by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> resemble rather those of the higher plants than those known from green algae [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In higher plants, sitosterol and campesterol were reported to be able to regulate the membrane fluidity and permeability, and stigmasterol is specifically required for cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The active synthesis of sterols has been reported to occur during rapid cell division with concomitant synthesis of new membranes and to reduce drastically under low nitrogen conditions [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Both, sitosterol and campesterol were found to be decreased in the later stages of growth (Phase III and IV) to approximately up to 2-fold in comparison to Phase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, iii), thus, indicating an overall decreased cell proliferation.</p><p>Apart from the metabolites mentioned above, intracellular photosynthetic pigments of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP 807/2, involved in light harvesting and photo-protective mechanisms, were also analyzed and found to be composed of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b as well as the carotenoids antheraxanthin, neoxanthin, loroxanthin, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;-carotene, echinenone and 3&#x02019;-hydroxyechinenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>). All photosynthetic pigments were found to be increased during Phase III as compared to Phase II except for antheraxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin. In contrast, most pigments were significantly reduced (except for echinenone, 3&#x02019;-hydroxyechinenone and an unknown carotenoid) at the end of the cultivation during Phase IV. Interestingly, the non-polar keto-carotenoid echinenone could not be detected in Phase II and only appeared during later stages of the cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, Phase III and IV). In previous research, the initiation of echinenone synthesis was suggested to be concomitant with the onset of nitrogen deficiency in the culture medium [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], since this secondary carotenoid is produced during the stationary phase and then further transported to the lipid-rich matrix, where it is most likely involved in light protective mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Moreover, it has been proposed that the color change of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) is mainly attributed to the accumulation of echinenone in the intracellular matrix and a concomitant decrease in intracellular pigments [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Additionally, apart from the chlorophylls a and b, the carotenoid lutein was found to be the most abundant pigment at phase II (24.6&#x000b1;7.5%), which is in good agreement with previous reports for lutein being the dominant carotenoid in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> in the linear phase of growth [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, the relative level of lutein decreased during further cultivation up to 1.4 and 3.6-fold (to 17.8&#x000b1;1.5% and 6.9&#x000b1;1.0%) in phases III and IV in comparison to the linear growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>), thus underlining once again the onset of the stationary phase as suggested before [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>In addition, within the examination of the intracellular metabolic response of the proposed growth phases (<italic>viz</italic> Phases II, III and IV at cultivation days 6, 15 and 30, respectively) of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP807/2, the analysis of total intracellular lipid content and subsequent evaluation of the fatty acid profile was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2C, 2D and 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>). The gravimetrically determined total lipid content reached 21.2&#x000b1;1.9% and 20.4&#x000b1;3.1% of dry biomass weight (DW) at Phases II and III, respectively, followed by a further slight increase to 23.3&#x000b1;1.4% of DW at the end of the cultivation (Phase IV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

While the total polar lipid content successively decreased with the progressing cultivation (from 11.4&#x000b1;1.2% to 6.5&#x000b1;1.2% of DW at Phase II and IV), the non-polar lipid content elevated from 9.8&#x000b1;0.6% of DW at Phase II to 16.8&#x000b1;2.8% of DW at Phase IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p><p>Detailed analysis of the fatty acid profiles derived from polar and non-polar lipid fractions of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP 807/2 revealed a diverse composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). For fatty acids derived from the polar fraction, palmitic (C<sub>16:0</sub>), oleic (C<sub>18:1n9c</sub>) and octacosenoic (C<sub>28:1</sub>) acids were found to be the most abundant in all analyzed growth stages i.e. Phase II&#x02013;IV, representing up to 74% of all identified fatty acids in this fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s004">S1 Table</xref>).

Another noteworthy finding was the presence of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) such as hexacosenoate (C<sub>26:1</sub>), octacosenoate (C<sub>28:1</sub>), octacosadienoate (C<sub>28:2</sub>), tricontenoate (C<sub>30:1</sub>) in both polar and non-polar lipid fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>), since these VLCFA were reported to originate from oleic acid and to function as precursor for rigid polymers associated with the structure of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> outer cell walls [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interestingly, the VLCFAs derived from the polar lipid fraction increased in their relative abundance, while they were found to be decreased in the non-polar fraction during cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>).</p><p>However, the non-polar lipid fraction of CCAP 807/2 appeared to be more differentiated in comparison to the polar fraction at different stages of growth (Phase II&#x02013;IV) and also contained hydrocarbons as they were co-extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). While, all the fatty acids from the non-polar lipid fraction showed a similar response and decreased over the period of cultivation, the abundance of hydrocarbons within the same fraction increased dramatically over the time course of the cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).

Thus, similarly to the accumulation behavior of the total carbohydrates, the active accumulation of the external carbohydrates of up to 38% of culture oDW could be observed between the Phases II and III (i.e. during linear and stationary growth phases), while no further enhancement was observed in later growth phases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0198976.t001">Table 1</xref>). Possible explanations for this observation could be the occurrence of the detachment of carbohydrates (excised segments of the algal retaining cell wall and its fibril sheath) only during the active cell division of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and/or the release of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes into the culture medium after cell lysis [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Based on the results of the physiological properties and intracellular metabolites of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> CCAP807/2 obtained within the present study, the onset of the stationary growth phase occurred between the days 12&#x02013;15, when the active cell division was diminished mainly due to the nutrient depletion of the culture medium (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198976.g002">2</xref>; sections 3.1 and 3.2). Additionally, the presence of the bacterial consortium, co-existing with all <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> cells, might also play a role in the reduction of extracellular carbohydrates in the culture supernatant [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, a detailed analysis of these cell-free supernatant carbohydrates revealed that besides the presence of rhamnose and uronate, galactose was the main component. The relative abundance of all these compounds gradually increased at later stages of cultivation, when compared to the linear growth phase (Phase II, day 6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This observation is in good agreement with earlier findings that galactose represents the major component of all heterogeneous polysaccharides produced by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>braunii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and may represent the polysaccharide chain backbone of the cell shells together with other saccharides as side chains [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

However, this hypothesis may represent the subject of future studies and should be thoroughly investigated.</p><p>The evaluation of the total extracellular hydrocarbon content of CCAP807/2, extracted from the whole culture broth increased gradually, starting from day 9, and reached a maximal productivity of up to 40 mg L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> between the days 15 and 24 (Phase III and start of Phase IV, proposed stationary and decline growth phases, respectively). Upon quantification, the qualitative analysis revealed C<sub>29</sub>H<sub>56</sub> (nonacosadiene) to be the most abundant hydrocarbon followed by C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>52</sub> (heptacosadiene) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198976.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Interestingly, on day 24 of the cultivation, the alkadienes C<sub>29</sub>H<sub>56</sub> and C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>52</sub> as well as the alkatriene C<sub>29</sub>H<sub>54</sub> (nonacosatriene) were found to be the most prominent components.

This finding indicated that rather the <italic>n</italic>-hexane-extractable proportion of the hydrocarbons decreases and not the total hydrocarbon content of the culture. And indeed, Casadevall and co-workers suggested the reduction of hydrocarbons during prolonged stationary phase to be attributed to the aging of the culture, which might influence the preferential location of hydrocarbon accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Overall, <italic>Botryococcus braunii</italic> CCAP 807/2 cultures reached within the present study maximal production yields of up to 84% of oDW of the whole culture broth in form of carbohydrates and secreted hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0198976.t001">Table 1</xref>). The observed findings clearly show that this strain possesses a higher carbon partitioning towards carbohydrates than lipids (particularly hydrocarbons), and are therefore consistent with previous assumptions that the low production of hydrocarbons contrasts with the high production yields of carbohydrates [<xref rid="pone.0198976.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
