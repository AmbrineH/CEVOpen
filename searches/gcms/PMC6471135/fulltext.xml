Introduction</title><p>Bread is a staple food consumed around the world and, like other perishable products, is susceptible to fungal contamination. Therefore, the fungal spoilage is a concern on bakery industry, representing a significant source of economic losses and a potential risk to human health due to the production of mycotoxin by toxigenic fungi, mainly from genus <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Penicillium</italic> [<xref rid="B1-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Bread possess a relatively high water activity (a<sub>w</sub> 0.94&#x02013;0.97) with a pH ranging from approximately 7 to 8.6 [<xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These properties are favorable for the germination and growth of a wide range of molds. The loaves of bread have a higher probability of fungal growth since they are commonly sliced. This process increases the surface area for microbial contamination; moreover, the slicing machine can be a vector of spoilage agents [<xref rid="B3-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Microbial spoilage reduces the shelf life of food and compromises the safety of consumers with the consequent economic loss for the industry. In this context, synthetic additives are widely used in the food industry and play an important role in the preservation of food quality as well as inhibiting the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms [<xref rid="B4-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nowadays, consumers demand a reduction of synthetic additives in food due to the concern of the effect of these substances on health. For this reason, the increment in the food of antimicrobial substances from natural sources may be an alternative to increase the shelf life and safety of products, satisfying the consumer requirements [<xref rid="B5-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A healthy diet should include vegetables of Brassica genus such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage or cauliflower. These vegetables are health-promoting due to the high concentration of ascorbic acid, selenium, soluble fiber and glucosinolates (GTS). Among these compounds, the GTS are secondary metabolites that have been extensively studied in the past decades. Depending on their side chain can be classified in aromatic, indolic or aliphatic compounds [<xref rid="B6-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. After tissue damage, the GTS is hydrolyzed by enzymes denominated myrosinases. These enzymes are stored separately from GTS in vacuoles inside the plant cell [<xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. After the tissue disruption, the myrosinase cleaves the thioglucosides releasing an unstable aglycone named thiohydroximate-<italic>O</italic>-sulphonate. This substance spontaneously rearranges in various products such as isothiocyanates (ITCs), nitriles, organic thiocyanates or epithionitriles depending on the pH of the medium, the presence of specific proteins and particular structural prerequisites [<xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The ITCs are unique in comparison to other essential oils, since they are formed only when the plant cell undergoes some type of injury such as insect bite, grinding, milling or fungi contamination, in addition to the presence of water [<xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, ITCs are not present in mustard flour, being formed slowly after the addition of water. The antifungal activity of ITCs has been widely studied in the last decade due to its biocidal activity against microorganisms, including bacteria [<xref rid="B10-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], fungi [<xref rid="B11-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], nematodes [<xref rid="B12-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and insects [<xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The mechanism of action of ITCs are not clearly described but within the cell, ITCs react with nonspecific molecules in the plasm such as saccharides, amino acids, proteins, and lipids, essential components for maintaining life [<xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The main ITC generated by the hydrolysis of the glucosinolate sinigrin give rise of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), which has shown antimicrobial activity at low concentration against pathogenic microorganisms [<xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The employment of AITC as an antimicrobial compound from natural sources has been analyzed in several perishable food matrices like tuna meet [<xref rid="B17-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], pork sausage [<xref rid="B18-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], chopped beef [<xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], dry-cured ham [<xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and cheese [<xref rid="B21-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to elaborate an active packaging system containing a packaged sauce of oriental mustard flour (OMF) to generate allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) in order to prevent the <italic>Penicillium verrucosum</italic> growth and ochratoxin A production in pita bread. In addition, the kinetics of volatilization and residual concentrations of AITC in the food matrix were evaluated to know the evolution of the antimicrobial compound during the storage period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-24-01019"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-24-01019"><title>2.1. Residual Czoncentration of AITC in Plastic Tray Headspace and Pita Bread</title><p>The addition of OMF as an ingredient in the sauce allowed the hydrolysis of sinigrin to generate AITC. Consequently, the AITC was volatilized reducing the fungal growth of the <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> in pita bread. The samples were studied using four different OMF concentrations: 8, 16, 33 and 50 mg/g. In particular, the concentration of AITC released by the sauce in the headspace of the plastic tray was proportional to the quantity of mustard flour used in the sauce formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01019-f001">Figure 1</xref>). After 1h of incubation, the AITC detected in the headspace ranged from 1 to 7 mg/L to the treatments of 8 and 50 mg/g, respectively. These concentrations increased up to 8 h of incubation, which was the point time with a maximum concentration of AITC in the headspace, reaching values of this antifungal compound ranging from 2.3 to 12.9 mg/L for the treatments of 8 and 50 mg/g of OMF, respectively. As showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01019-f001">Figure 1</xref>, after 8 h, the AITC detected in the plastic tray volume decreased up to obtaining constant concentrations at day seven of incubation that ranged from 0.4 to 1.1 mg/L of AITC. It is important to emphasize that the concentrations of AITC detected during all the storage period of the pita bread and considering all the quantity of the oriental mustard flour used for the sauce development are close to the inhibitory concentration referenced by Lopes et al. [<xref rid="B22-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] against <italic>Penicillium nordicum</italic> (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/L).</p><p>Related with the amount of the AITC absorbed by the pita bread during the storage period of evaluation, the results of this determination are shown in <xref rid="molecules-24-01019-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In particular, at 7 days of incubation, the concentration of the AITC detected on bread ranged from 4.3 to 59.3 mg/kg depending by the dose of the OMF used for the sauce formulation. Analyzing the amount of this antifungal compound after the storage period stipulated in this study and in particular, after 14 days, it is possible to observe that the AITC was detected just in the bread treated with 33 and 50 mg/g of the OMF with concentrations ranged from 15.9 to 25.6 mg/kg, respectively. These concentrations observed at day 14 were lower in comparison with those detected at day 7, probably due to that the sinigrin present in the OMF could be hydrolyzed in other substances with less antimicrobial activity such as thiocyanates and nitriles [<xref rid="B23-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, the AITC generated by hydrolysis of sinigrin can react with group amino of several peptides in the matrix to form a conjugate and reducing its concentration [<xref rid="B24-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) described the safety of AITC when used as a food preservative or active packaging [<xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Considering the weight of our product (40 g) and the concentration of AITC absorbed at day 7, the treatments of 33 and 50 mg/g showed a total concentration of 1.93 and 2.37 mg of AITC, respectively. These values were higher than the established for the EFSA for the acceptable daily intake of 0.02 mg/kg BW/day. However, the exposition of AITC by adult consumers from different sources could exceedance from 2 to 8 times the total daily exposure of AITC without toxic effects demonstrated. After day 7, the total concentration of AITC gradually decreased and all treatments showed values above the 0.02 mg/kg BW/day. </p><p>Nielsen and Rios evaluated the sensorial effect of AITC in bread packed [<xref rid="B26-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The sensorial test was realized with the untrained panel and the results suggested that the judges did not identify doses above 2 mg of AITC. Therefore, after 7 days of storage, the AITC could be undetectable to the human palate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-24-01019"><title>2.2. Shelf Life Improvement of Pita Bread Contaminated with P. verrucosum and OTA Production</title><p>Related with the shelf life results of pita bread contaminated with <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> and treated with the bioactive sauce elaborated with different quantities of OMF the data is showed in <xref rid="molecules-24-01019-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In particular, in the control group, a visible growth of the <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> was detected at day three of incubation, whereas the commercial control formulated with calcium propionate presented a visible fungal growth at day five with an increase of the bread shelf life in comparison with the control of 2 days. The pita bread treated with the bioactive sauce prepared with 8 mg/g of the OMF presented a shelf life of 4 days, whereas the application of 16 mg/g of OMF in the sauce obtained the same shelf life of the pita bread with commercial control (E-282 additive). The pita bread exposed to the sauce containing 33 mg/g of the OMF presented an increase of the shelf life in comparison with the commercial control and control of 3 and 1 days, respectively. Using the OMF in the quantity of 50 mg/g for the antifungal sauce formulation, any visible <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> growth has been observed on the pita bread during the incubation period analyzed.</p><p>The results of visible fungal growth on the pita bread exposed to the AITC vapors generated by sinigrin conversion are according to the microbial population detected in the bread after 7 days of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01019-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01019-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the control experiment presented 8.3 logs UFC/g, whereas the bread produced with the E-282 additive, evidenced fungal contamination of 6.8 logs UFC/g, 1.5 logs lower than the data observed in the control experiment. The application of 8 mg/g of the OMF did not produce any significant decrease in the fungal population when compared to the control experiment and with the bread baked with E-282, whereas using 16, 33 and 50 mg/g of the OMF, the log of the UFC/g of <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> detected was of 6.8, 5.2 and 2.6, respectively. The log reduction of <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> for the treatments of 16, 33 and 50 mg/g was the 1.5, 3.1 and 5.7, respectively, in comparison to the control group.</p><p>Clemente et al. analyzed the use of benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) incorporated in an active packaging against <italic>A. ochraceus.</italic> The use of BITC in vapor phase inhibited the fungal growth by promoting morphological alteration and cellular damage depending on the contact with the antifungal compound [<xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Likewise, the use of AITC reduced the fungal growth of <italic>A. flavus</italic> over time. These results suggested that AITC could also generate to cell damage.</p><p>Considering that the strain of the <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> used in this study is OTA producer, the data related to the production of this toxic compound in pita bread are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01019-f004">Figure 4</xref>. In particular, after 7 days of incubation, the control experiment presented 9.1 mg/kg of the OTA, whereas, on the pita bread baked with the preservative compound E-282, the concentration of this toxic compound detected was 6.3 mg/kg. In the pita bread sealed in the plastic tray and treated with the bioactive sauce with 8 mg/g of the OMF, no statistically differences on the OTA production was detected in comparison to the control group. On the other hand, the treatments of 16 and 33 mg/g of the OMF showed 6.2 and 3.4 mg/kg of OTA in the bread on day 7, respectively. These values are significantly different from the control group, respectively.</p><p>All treatments demonstrated values of OTA higher than 3.0 &#x000b5;g/kg stipulated by CE (1881/2006) for processed cereal products [<xref rid="B28-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, with the increment of 50 mg/g of the OMF in the sauce was able to avoid the OTA production to not detected levels, showing an antifungal and anti-mycotoxigenic potential of the OMF as an ingredient in the sauce.</p><p>In the study of Quiles et al. [<xref rid="B29-molecules-24-01019" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], active packaging containing AITC or OMF were evaluated as preservatives in pizza crust inoculated with <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic> as aflatoxin producer. The inhibition of <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> growth was detected after 30 days with the employment of gaseous AITC at 5 mL/L and 10 mL/L, sachets containing 5 mL/L and 10 mL/L of AITC and OMF sachet elaborated with 850 mg more 850 mL of water. These authors demonstrated that the application of OMF sachet at 850 mg + 850 mL of water could completely avoid the aflatoxins (AFs) production. These results corroborate with our data since the implementation of OMF in concentrations higher than 50 mg can reduce mycotoxin production by fungal inhibition.</p><p>Quiles et al.

The treatment consisted of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 g of yellow or oriental mustard flour mixed with 2 mL of water, with a storage period of 1 month. The AITC generated from the sinigrin hydrolyzed in OMF and the p-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate (p-HBITC) obtained from yellow mustard flour inhibited the mycotoxin production. However, the treatments with OMF were more effective.

The stationary phase was an analytical column of reversed phase (Gemini C18 column, 150mm &#x000d7; 2mm &#x000d7; 3 mm) (Phenomenex, Madrid, Spain). The mobile phases employed as eluents consisted of water 0.1% formic acid with 5 mM ammonium formate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) (A) and methanol with 5 mM ammonium formate and formic acid at 0.1% (B). Elution gradient was established as follows. The initial condition was 10% B increasing to 80% in 1.5 min and kept up to 2.5 min. Afterward, eluent B was increased to 90% in 6 min and later 100% was obtained in 4 min. Posteriorly, the initial conditions (B: 10%) were reestablished for 5 min. The flow rate was set at 0.25 mL/min in all steps. Injection volume was 20 &#x000b5;L. MS/MS analysis was obtained applying the parameters: the ion spray voltage at 5500 V; source temperature, 450 &#x000b0;C; curtain gas, 20 psi; the ion source gas 1 to sheath gas at 50 psi; the ion source gas 2 or drying gas at 55 psi.

In conclusion, OMF could be potentially used as a precursor of antimicrobial substances against <italic>Penicillium</italic> species, commonly found as contaminants in bakery products. Considering the current trend of reducing the presence of synthetic chemical additives in food, the employment of natural ingredients that releases antimicrobial substances such as OMF may be an alternative to food preservation rather than traditional additives.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Sample Availability:</bold> Samples of the compounds are available from the authors.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>The authors (R.T. and T.M.N.) consider that the first two authors should be regarded as joint first authors.
