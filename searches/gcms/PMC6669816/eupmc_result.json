    "Artemisia has long been used in traditional medicine and as a food source for different functions in eastern Asia. Artemisia vulgaris L. (AV) is a species of the genus Artemisia. Essential oils (EOs) were extracted from AV by subcritical butane extraction. EO contents were detected by electronic nose and headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography (HS-SPME-GC-MS). To investigate the hepatoprotective effects, mice subjected to liver injury were treated intragastrically with EOs or eucalyptol for 3 days. Acetaminophen (APAP) alone caused severe liver injury characterized by significantly increased serum AST and ALT levels, ROS and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) depletions. EOs significantly attenuated APAP-induced liver damages. Further study confirmed that eucalyptol is an inhibitor of Keap1, the affinity K D of eucalyptol and Keap1 was 1.42 Ã— 10-5, which increased the Nrf2 translocation from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. The activated Nrf2 increased the mRNA expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs), also inhibiting CYP2E1 activities. Thus, the activated Nrf2 suppressed toxic intermediate formation, promoting APAP hepatic non-toxicity, whereby APAP was metabolized into APAP-gluc and APAP-sulf. Collectively, APAP non-toxic metabolism was accelerated by eucalyptol in protecting the liver against APAP-induced injury, indicating eucalyptol or EOs from AV potentials as a natural source of hepatoprotective agent."
