Background</div> <p>Metagenomic studies carried out in the past decade have led to an enhanced understanding of the gut microbiome in human health; however, the Indian gut microbiome has not been well explored. We analyzed the gut microbiome of 110 healthy individuals from two distinct locations (North-Central and Southern) in India using multi-omics approaches, including 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic profiling of fecal and serum samples. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p>The gene catalogue established in this study emphasizes the uniqueness of the Indian gut microbiome in comparison to other populations. The gut microbiome of the cohort from North-Central India, which was primarily consuming a plant-based diet, was found to be associated with <i>Prevotella</i> and also showed an enrichment of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, the gut microbiome of the cohort from Southern India, which was consuming an omnivorous diet, showed associations with <i>Bacteroides, Ruminococcus</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and had an enrichment of short chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and BCAA transporters. This corroborated well with the metabolomics results, which showed higher concentration of BCAAs in the serum metabolome of the North-Central cohort and an association with <i>Prevotella</i>. In contrast, the concentration of BCAAs was found to be higher in the fecal metabolome of the Southern-India cohort and showed a positive correlation with the higher abundance of BCAA transporters. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p>The study reveals the unique composition of the Indian gut microbiome, establishes the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue, and compares it with the gut microbiome of other populations. The functional associations revealed using metagenomic and metabolomic approaches provide novel insights on the gut-microbe-metabolic axis, which will be useful for future epidemiological and translational researches. </p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

Background</div> <p>Determining the taxonomic and functional composition of a healthy gut microbiome across different populations is essential for understanding its role in maintaining human health. Several large-scale, world-wide microbiome projects have revealed variability in the gut microbial composition of healthy individuals due to factors such as mode of delivery, age, geographical location, diet, and lifestyle [ <a href="#bib1">1–5</a>]. The majority of the gut microbiome studies have determined microbial taxonomy and functional diversity using 16S rRNA marker gene-based and/or whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approaches to understand the functional role of the gut microbiome. However, novel insights on the complex interplay among diet, gut microbes, and human health, along with the role of key microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), derived from the microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, are beginning to emerge from recent gut metabolomics studies [ <a href="#bib6">6</a>, <a href="#bib7">7</a>]. Moreover, the direct impact of microbial metabolome on human health is also becoming apparent from the recent studies focusing on the "gut microbiome-host metabolism axis" [ <a href="#bib8">8</a>]. Therefore, an integrative approach using both metagenome and metabolome-based characterizations of the gut microbiome appears pragmatic for gaining deeper functional and mechanistic insights into the role of gut microbes on human health. </p> <p>The large-scale studies carried out so far mainly represent the gut microbiome of urban populations primarily from Europe, the United States, and other "WEIRD" countries (i.e., the Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic countries) [ <a href="#bib9">9</a>, <a href="#bib10">10</a>]. Only recently, some studies have characterized the human microbiome from diverse ethnic populations and found significant compositional variations compared to the microbiomes from other previously studied populations [ <a href="#bib11">11–14</a>]. India is the seventh largest country in the world and harbors the second largest population spread across multiple geographical locations with enormous diversity in ethnicity, lifestyles, and dietary habits. India is home to the majority of the world's vegetarian population but also has an almost equal representation of its population consuming animal-based diets. The Indian population also has the highest prevalence of diabetes in the world [ <a href="#bib15">15</a>]. According to the World Health Organization estimates (WHO, 2011), 53% of deaths in India in the year 2008 were attributed to metabolic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are predicted to reach ∼75% by 2030 [ <a href="#bib16">16</a>]. </p> <p>A few studies have investigated the gut microbiome of the Indian population. A recent study by Maji et al. has shown the functional association of human gut microbiome dysbiosis with tuberculosis through a time-course study of six tuberculosis patients in India [ <a href="#bib17">17</a>]. However, other gut microbiome studies were mainly limited by small cohort sizes and amplicon-based (16S rRNA gene) sequencing and analysis [ <a href="#bib17">17–21</a>]. Thus, several large-scale efforts are needed to identify the Indian population-specific microbiome biomarkers and to understand the impact of the gut microbiome on health and disease in the Indian population along with global comparisons. </p> <p>However, to uncover the enormous gut microbiome diversity inherent in the different sub-populations of India, extensive sampling and analyses are required. Therefore, as the first large-scale study from India, we selected two prominent locations in North-Central India, i.e., LOC1: Bhopal city, Madhya Pradesh, and Southern India, i.e., LOC2: Kerala. The two locations also had different dietary habits. The Southern-India (LOC2) diet consisted of rice, meat, and fish, whereas the North-Central (LOC1) diet consisted of carbohydrate-rich food including plant-derived products, wheat, and trans-fat food (high-fat dairy, sweets, and fried snacks). The Human Development Index Report (UNDP; United Nations Development Programme), India and SRS-based life-table (Sample Registration Survey, 2010–14) has revealed that the citizens from Kerala had the highest life-expectancy rates (&amp;gt;74 years) in India, whereas those in Madhya Pradesh (capital city Bhopal) exhibited the lowest (&amp;lt;65 years) [ <a href="#bib22">22</a>]. Further, a higher predisposition of the North-Indian population towards diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension is also known, which in contrast is much lower in Southern India, perhaps due to the lifestyle differences in the two regions [ <a href="#bib15">15</a>, <a href="#bib23">23</a>]. Thus, to gain deeper functional insights into the microbiome from these two distinct sub-populations of India, a multi-omics approach was carried out using amplicon-based profiling of taxonomic composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing), WGS-based profiling of metagenome, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based profiling of fecal and serum metabolomic signatures. </p> </div> <div class="datadescription" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Data Description</div> <p>The two selected locations, Bhopal (LOC1) and Kerala (LOC2) from North-Central and Southern parts of India, are about 2,000 kilometers apart and provided a distinct representation of the Indian population with respect to diet and lifestyle (Additional File 1). The 110 (62 females, 58 males) individuals recruited in this study were not suffering from any disease, as reported by personal medical history and physical examination, and confirmed no exposure to antibiotics for at least one month prior to sampling. Recruited individuals had an average body mass index (BMI) of 21.16 (±5.23 standard deviation), an average age of 29.72 years (±17.41 standard deviation), and were not diagnosed with any disease at the time of sample collection, and thus were considered as "healthy" (Additional File 1). Moreover, they did not have a second-degree relative history of T2D. The recruitment of volunteers, sample collection, and other study-related procedures were carried out by following the guidelines and protocols approved by the Institute Ethics Committee of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal, India. The fecal samples were frozen within 30 minutes of collection and were then used for 16S rRNA gene V3 hypervariable region amplicon sequencing, WGS-based metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic analysis. Further, the serum samples collected from a subset of volunteers were used for GC-MS-based metabolomics analysis. The sequencing of V3 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenome sequencing from the 110 fecal samples resulted in 54.87 million paired-end reads (503,460 ± 175,547 [mean ± standard deviation] reads/sample) and 499.98 million paired-end reads (4,545,280 ± 1,498,663 [mean ± standard deviation] reads/sample), respectively (Methods, Additional File 2 and Additional File 3). The metabolomic analysis was also performed on all fecal and subset of serum samples collected from the same healthy participants using GC-MS, and the resultant raw files were used for further analysis. The data description of participants and the data generated from each sample are provided in Additional File 1 under the Metadata information section. </p> </div> <div class="analyses" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Construction of an Indian gut microbial gene catalogue and updated integrated gene catalogue </div> <p>The first step for functional analysis was the construction of an extensive catalogue of gut microbial genes from the Indian population, which was not available previously. A De Bruijn graph-based assembly of reads resulted in 2,165,507 contigs of length ≥500 bp with a total contig size of 3.086 Gbp representing 68.25% of total reads and a mean N50 value of 2,288 bp. To obtain assemblies of low coverage genomic regions or genomes present in the Indian gut microbiome, the reads from each sample were mapped on assembled contigs obtained from their respective sample, and the remaining singletons (unassembled reads) were pooled and re-assembled together into an additional 45,839 contigs with length ≥500 bp and a total assembled length of 34.68 Mbp. A total of 1,551,581 non-redundant genes were predicted from contigs, which represent the gut microbial gene catalogue of the Indian cohorts. </p> <p>The integrated gene catalogue (IGC) established by Li et al. in a previous multicohort study consisted of 9,879,896 genes identified from 1,267 gut metagenomes representing multiple populations [ <a href="#bib24">24</a>]. A total of 943,395 genes (sharing &amp;lt; 90% identity with IGC) out of 1,551,581 from the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue were identified as unique to the Indian microbial gene catalogue. The IGC was updated to construct an "Updated-IGC" by adding these 943,395 non-redundant genes from the Indian gene catalogue. The updated-IGC consisting of 10,823,291 non-redundant genes (an 8.8% increase from IGC) was used as the reference gene catalogue for the subsequent analysis performed in this study. A total of 70.74% (±3.77% standard deviation) mapping coverage of reads (∼7.5% increase in the mapping of reads) was observed from the 110 Indian samples on the updated-IGC as compared to 63% (±4.61% standard deviation) on IGC, showing a significant (False Discovery Rate (FDR) adj. <i>P</i> value = 10 <sup>−16</sup>; Student <i>t</i>test) increase in mapping of Indian microbial dataset (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1A</a> and Additional File 4). The datasets from populations in the United States (HMP), Denmark (MetaHIT), and China (a study from Qin et al.) mentioned in Table <a href="#tbl1">1</a> were used for a comparative analysis of the microbiome of the Indian population with other populations [ <a href="#bib7">7</a>, <a href="#bib10">10</a>, <a href="#bib25">25</a>]. The mapping of reads from these three datasets (HMP, MetaHIT, and China) on updated-IGC (mean mapping coverage: HMP = 67.74%, MetaHIT = 75.21%, and China = 77.44%) did not show a significant ( <i>P</i> values: HMP = 0.5, MetaHIT = 0.85, and China = 0.17; Student <i>t</i>test) increment from their mapping coverage on IGC (mean mapping coverage: HMP = 66.93%, MetaHIT = 75.02%, and China = 77.37%) as observed in Fig. <a href="#fig1">1A</a>. This shows that the addition of a subset of non-redundant genes (sharing &amp;lt;90% identity with IGC) from the Indian gut microbiome to the IGC significantly increased (FDR adj. <i>P</i> value = 10 <sup>−16</sup>; Student <i>t</i>test) the mapping percentage of reads from the Indian microbiome dataset as compared to the other datasets. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1:</span> </a> </div>   <p>Comparison of the Indian gut microbiome with other major populations using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic datasets. <b>(A)</b> Percentage of total reads that could be mapped to IGC and updated IGC containing the Indian gene catalogue.

Identification of taxonomic signatures of Indian gut microbiome</div> <p>To determine the taxonomic and functional composition of the Indian gut microbiome and to identify Indian-specific gut-microbial signatures, a cross-population comparison was carried out using the 16S rRNA gene hypervariable region and shotgun metagenomic data from the other populations. A reference-independent metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) was carried out to identify the Indian-specific gut metagenomic markers through a comparison with similar large-scale studies from other populations [ <a href="#bib26">26</a>]. The genes from the metagenomic samples of four countries (India, China, the United States, and Denmark) were clustered (see Methods section) into 924 clusters based on their co-occurrence and Pearson correlations (ρ ≥ 0.9) across samples, resulting in 335 metagenomic species (MGS) having ≥700 genes in each cluster, and 589 co-abundance gene groups (CAGs) consisting of ≥100 genes in each cluster. Out of the 924 metagenomic clusters, 195 could be assigned up to the species level using the taxonomic assignment strategy described in the Methods section. Canberra distances were calculated from MGS/CAG abundance profiles and their principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using "countries" as factors for explaining the variance between samples, which showed that the Indian population formed a distinct cluster from the other populations in PCA (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1B</a>). It is interesting to note that the samples from the Indian cohort were more widely spread owing to the higher inter-sample Canberra distances between Indian samples (mean = 0.689) as compared to other datasets having average inter-sample distances of 0.61, 0.59, and 0.54 for US, China, and Denmark populations, respectively ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</a>). This could be attributed to the significant (FDR adj. <i>P</i> value = 0.00013) differences in MGS abundance profiles between LOC1 and LOC2 populations as revealed on comparison of their principal coordinates ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</a>). </p> <p>Further, the identification of enriched MGS from <i>P</i> values calculated using negative binomial (NB) model-based Wald test (implemented in DESeq2) and log odds ratio showed that the species belonging to the genera <i>Bacteroides, Alistipes, Clostridium</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were depleted in the Indian population (China, Denmark, and United States; log odds ratio &amp;lt; −2 and adj. <i>P</i> value &amp;lt; 0.01), whereas the MGS/CAGs annotated as <i>Prevotella, Mitsuokella, Dialister, Megasphaera</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> were found to be associated with the Indian population (adj. <i>P</i> value &amp;lt; 0.01; log odds ratio &amp;gt; 2) and were the major drivers for separation of Indian samples from other populations (Additional File 5: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</a>; Additional File 6). Furthermore, the distribution of microbial families across 10 different populations was also calculated using 16S rRNA gene markers, which revealed the Indian gut microbiome to have the highest abundance of Prevotellaceae (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1C</a>). The feature selection method applied using random forest along with pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test also identified Prevotellaceae to be significantly higher (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) in gut microbiome of Indian cohort compared to the other population datasets except Indonesia ( <i>P</i> value = 0.506) ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>; <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Figs. S4</a>, <a href="#sup1">S5</a>, and <a href="#sup1">S6</a>) where a comparable abundance of Prevotellaceae was present. The high abundance of Prevotellaceae in the Indian population underscores its importance as the marker taxa for the Indian cohort. </p> </div> <div class="microbialfunctionsenrichedintheindianpopulation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Microbial functions enriched in the Indian population</div> <p>Functional comparison of Indian microbiome with other populations was carried out by mapping the genes derived from assembled contigs to the EggNOG database. In total 69,386 EggNOG functions were identified from the Indian gut microbiome, including 2,328 novel functions obtained from clustering the unmapped genes (see Methods section). The core microbial functions that are essential for microbial survival and present in almost 80% individuals were used for the functional comparison. The core microbiome was derived using a similar strategy as employed in MetaHIT (see Methods section) [ <a href="#bib25">25</a>]. A set of 1,890 essential genes from six bacterial species, namely, <i>Escherichia coli</i> MG1655I and MG165II, <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> VPI-5482, <i>Pseudomonas</i> PA01, <i>Salmonella enteric</i> serovar <i>Typhi</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> NCTC 8325, were obtained and were assigned with eggNOG annotations. The eggNOG abundance profile generated from relative abundances of genes observed in Indian and other population datasets were ranked based on their mean abundance in descending order. The range of eggNOGs that included 85% of the 1,890 essential genes were considered as a part of the core microbial eggNOG set for each population dataset and was used for the analysis. Most of the essential genes were included in the top-ranking clusters, suggesting that the essential genes are present in higher abundance than the accessory function genes ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7</a>). </p> <p>The core microbiome of Indian samples was compared with the core microbiome of US, China, and Denmark populations. The proportion of essential genes covered by top-ranking eggNOG clusters showed that 85% of the essential genes could be covered in the least number (15,300) of eggNOGs in the case of Indian population, whereas it was covered by a higher number of eggNOGs in the case of US (20,400), China (19,900), and Denmark (30,900) populations ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S8</a>). These observations suggest that the core functional microbiome of Indian population is less diverse than the other populations. This corroborates well with the alpha diversity (mean Shannon index) calculated using gene abundance tables rarefied at 1,000,000 seqs/sample (for n = 30 random iterations), which also showed that the Indian microbiome is significantly ( <i>P</i> value &amp;lt; 10 <sup>−16</sup>) less diverse than the microbiome of the other populations analyzed in this study ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S9</a>). </p> <p>In total, 5,588 eggNOGs were characterized as core functions commonly present in the core microbiome of all the four population datasets. The co-inertia (Procrustes) analysis and the eigenvalues calculated from PCA using both core and accessory functions also showed that the Indian gut microbiome was significantly (FDR adj. <i>P</i> value = 6.4 × 10 <sup>−10</sup>, 2 × 10 <sup>−16</sup> and 0.05 with China, Denmark, and United States, respectively, for PC1) different from the other datasets (Fig. <a href="#fig2">2A</a> and 2B). These results also show the uniqueness of Indian gut microbial functions in composition and diversity at both core and accessory levels. The Indian gut microbiome was found to be enriched (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05, log odds ratio &amp;gt;1.5) in functions for carbohydrate and energy metabolism, including degradation of complex polysaccharides and glycogen, and was also enriched for enzymes from the TCA cycle, which corroborates well with the carbohydrate-rich diet of the Indian population (Fig. <a href="#fig2">2C</a> and <a href="#fig2">2D</a> and Additional File 7: enriched KO and EggNOG functions). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2:</span> </a> </div>   <p>Functional variations and differences between Indian populations and other populations determined from core and accessory microbial functions. <b>(A)</b> Procrustes analysis was performed on Bray Curtis distances calculated from core EggNOG and accessory EggNOG abundance tables in all populations.

Unsupervised clustering of Indian samples and their association with previously identified enterotypes </div> <p>Arumugam et al. classified the samples from multiple populations into clusters based on genus-level profiles and identified three prominent clusters called enterotypes [ <a href="#bib2">2</a>]. In order to identify the enterotypes from Indian gut microbiome, a meta-analysis was performed using genus-level abundances of samples from the four nations as used by Arumugam et al. along with the Indian cohort. There were three prominent clusters observed with the majority (63.6%) of Indian population falling into enterotype-2, which was primarily driven by <i>Prevotella</i>. The analysis revealed differences in the distribution of samples from LOC1 and LOC2, where a higher number of samples from LOC1 (73.5%) was associated with enterotype-2 compared to LOC2 (54%). In contrast, LOC2 samples were associated with enterotype-1 (30.3%) and enterotype-3 (16.07%), which were driven by <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i>, respectively (Fig. <a href="#fig3">3A</a>; Additional File 8). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 3:</span> </a> </div>   <p>Variations in gut microbiome at the two locations. <b>(A)</b> Between-class analysis, which visualizes results from PCA and clustering, using genus-level abundance from 37 cross-national datasets and genus abundance of 110 Indian samples obtained from mapping of reads to reference genomes.

The clustering was validated using the Calinski Harabasz index (CHI) and prediction strength, which uses a cross-validation approach to validate the robustness of clustering (Additional File 9). Cluster 1 was primarily enriched in species from genus <i>Prevotella</i> ( <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 10 <sup>−10</sup>), and Cluster 2 was quite widely spread and was enriched in species belonging to <i>Bifidobacterium</i> ( <i>P</i> = 10 <sup>−13</sup>), <i>Ruminococcus</i> ( <i>P</i> = 0.031), <i>Clostridium</i> ( <i>P</i> = 0.04), and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> ( <i>P</i> = 0.046) ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S10</a>, <a href="#sup1">Additional File 10</a>). The higher abundances of <i>Prevotella</i> in LOC1 and <i>Bacteroides</i> in LOC2 in India are perhaps due to the different dietary habits at the two locations. The LOC1 population was mainly consuming a carbohydrate-rich diet comprising vegetable-based foods and grains, whereas the LOC2 population was consuming a diet consisting of rice, meat, and fish. Similar variations in microbiome diversity due to differences in dietary habits have also been observed in earlier studies [ <a href="#bib27">27</a>, <a href="#bib28">28</a>]. However, to confirm the above observations and to assess the quantitative effect of dietary habits on microbial variations, further longitudinal studies are necessary where detailed dietary information needs to be collected through a food-frequency questionnaire. </p> <p>A similar cluster analysis performed using functional information derived from the abundance of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthologs (KO) also showed the clustering of samples into two distinct clusters, namely, C1 and C2 ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S11</a>). In comparison to clusters derived from taxonomic information, only 14 out of 110 samples were placed in different clusters using the functional information showing a similarity ( <i>P</i> value = 0.6841; Fisher exact test; Additional File 11) in cluster allocation using both taxonomic and functional information. C1 was found enriched in genes coding for enzymes such as β- glucosidase (Log Odds Ratio (LOR) = 3.364; <i>P</i> value = 10 <sup>−20</sup>), and α-fucosidase (LOR = 0.73; <i>P</i> = 10 <sup>−8</sup>), which are involved in the breakdown of plant-polysaccharides, whereas the genes coding for enzymes such as lipase (LOR = −1.34; <i>P</i> = 10 <sup>−12</sup>), carnitine-coA dehydratase (LOR = −1.81; <i>P</i> value = 0.029), and amino peptidase (LOR = −2.72; <i>P</i> = 10 <sup>−10</sup>), which are involved in the metabolism of an animal-based diet, were enriched in C2 (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) (Additional File 12). </p> <p>To identify the covariates explaining the maximum variations in microbial profiles across samples, unweighted UniFrac distances were calculated using phylogenetic distances between operational taxonomic unit (OTU) reference sequences and an OTU table rarefied at 100,000 seqs/sample. The principal component analysis of UniFrac distances and the correlation of loadings for each sample with the covariates using polyserial/biserial correlation identified distinct locations (LOC1 and LOC2) and diet (vegetarian and omnivorous) to be the major covariates explaining the variation in taxonomic diversity between the samples ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S12</a>, <a href="#sup1">Additional File 13</a>). An ordination of 110 Indian samples using gene abundance profiles from metagenomic data showed location and diet to be significantly (FDR adj. <i>P</i> value &amp;lt; 0.01; polyserial correlation) associated with PC1, explaining the maximum variation between samples ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S13</a>, <a href="#sup1">Additional File 13</a>). A significant correlation (ρ = 0.708; <i>P</i> value = 2 × 10 <sup>−16</sup> Spearman rank correlation) was also observed between location and diet covariates. A comparison of functional diversity using gene abundance curves with increasing number of samples performed between the two locations showed that the microbiome profiles of LOC2 populations were more diverse in their composition compared to LOC1 populations ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S14</a>). The inter-individual Bray-Curtis distances calculated on normalized gene abundance profiles between LOC1 and LOC2 populations also showed significant differences (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), where LOC2 population displayed higher inter-individual heterogeneity in their microbial community structure as compared to LOC1 population ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S15</a>). </p> <p>Major differences in the microbiome profiles were apparent at the Phylum level (using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) from the higher Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio ( <i>P</i> = 0.002) in LOC1 (1.93) compared to LOC2 (0.86), which have been previously reported as a result of differences in dietary habits, i.e., vegetarian or plant-based (carbohydrate-rich) vs omnivore or animal-based (protein-rich) diets ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S16</a>) [ <a href="#bib29">29</a>, <a href="#bib30">30</a>]. Notably, these variations were not attributable to BMI (Spearman rank correlation, FDR adj. <i>P</i> = 0.78). Taxonomic profiles generated from metagenomic datasets through reads mapped to reference genomes were compared between the two locations at genus and species levels using NB model-based Wald test implemented in DESeq2. <i>Prevotella</i>and <i>Megasphaera</i> were observed to be higher in LOC1, whereas <i>Ruminococcus</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> were higher in LOC2 (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. <a href="#fig3">3B</a>). Within these genera, <i>P. copri and P. stercorea</i> species were significantly higher in LOC1, whereas <i>F. prausnitzii</i> and <i>R. bromii</i> belonging to genus <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i>, respectively, were higher in LOC2. In addition, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila, Eubacterium siraeum</i>, and <i>Roseburia hominis</i> were observed to be higher in LOC2, and <i>M. funiformis</i> and <i>M. hypermegale</i> from genus <i>Megamonas</i> were higher in LOC1 (Fig. <a href="#fig3">3C</a>). Moreover, the metagenomic species derived from clustering of gene profiles showed that MGS/CAGs were enriched in LOC1 (log odds ratio &amp;gt;2; adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), of which seven MGS/CAGs were annotated to <i>Prevotella copri</i>. Similarly, 67 MGS/CAGs were found enriched in LOC2 (adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05; log odds ratio &amp;lt; −2) and included 8 and 3 MGS/CAGs annotated to SCFA-producing species <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> and <i>Roseburia inulinivorans</i>, respectively (Additional File 14). Interestingly, both, <i>F. prausnitzii</i> and <i>R. inulinivorans</i> species enriched in LOC2 are known SCFA producers and are regarded as commensals with anti-inflammatory properties [ <a href="#bib31">31</a>]. In contrast, <i>Prevotella</i>, which was abundant in the LOC1, is known to be associated with a fiber-rich diet [ <a href="#bib32">32</a>]. </p> </div> <div class="definingtheindiangutmetabolome" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Defining the Indian gut metabolome</div> <p>The analysis of microbial community structure and functions from the two locations having different lifestyle and diet revealed significant insights. Previous studies have shown a direct role of diet in shaping the different gut microbiomes [ <a href="#bib33">33</a>]. Thus, to gain deeper insights into the metabolic activity of microbiomes from LOC1 and LOC2 as driven by different diets, fecal metabolites were analyzed using a GC-MS-based metabolomics approach. An unsupervised between-class analysis of metabolomic profiles separated the samples into three separate clusters, and the robustness was confirmed using prediction strength and Silhouette index (Fig. <a href="#fig4">4A</a> and <a href="#fig4">4B</a>). Polyserial correlation of covariates showed location to be the major factor explaining the variation at PC1 (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) separating Cluster 1 from Clusters 2 and 3. In contrast, vegetarian and omnivorous diet groups emerged as other factors explaining the variation at PC2 (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and separating Cluster 2 from Cluster 3 (Additional File 15). The covariates' location and diet were also observed to be highly correlated variables showing their strong influence on gut microbiome. Cluster 1 was associated with LOC1 and showed higher concentration of saturated fatty acids including palmitic acid, stearic acid, and valeric acid. Cluster 3 was associated with LOC2 and showed higher abundances of BCAAs, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, and SCFAs, propionate, and butyrate concentrations. Cluster 2 was enriched in D-glucose, galactose, mannose, lauric acid, and cadaverine (a polyamine associated with meat consumption) and was also observed to be associated with LOC2 [ <a href="#bib34">34</a>]. To assess the effect of different covariates on the separation of samples, PERMANOVA was performed (Table <a href="#tbl2">2</a>). The location was found to explain maximum variation for separation of samples, whereas diet was the second most important variable in explaining the variance. The Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) model was used to expose the class separation for each of the covariates using Q <sup>2</sup> values that assessed the quality measurement (Table <a href="#tbl3">3</a>). The OPLS-DA models validated by random permutation (n = 200) of class labels showed Q <sup>2</sup> values for location and diet to be higher than Q <sup>2</sup> values produced from random permutations with location showing highest Q <sup>2</sup> values ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S17</a>). The OPLS-DA model also showed clear separation of samples between locations as class of separation (Fig. <a href="#fig4">4C</a>). </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 4:</span> </a> </div>   <p>Between-class analysis to identify metabotypes and their associated metabolites. <b>(A)</b> Metabolite clusters (MES) abundance profiles of samples were generated, and their clustering was performed using PAM (partitioning around medoids) clustering.

Positive correlation of BCAA transporters with BCAA levels in fecal metabolome</div> <p>We also identified the marker metabolites, which showed significant (Spearman correlation, FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) associations with LOC1 or LOC2. In total, 17 metabolite clusters were identified, of which 9 were associated with LOC1 and 8 were associated with LOC2 (Additional File 16). These marker metabolites showed a positive association with MGS/CAGs. For instance, <i>Prevotella</i> annotated clusters correlated significantly with valeric acid and sedoheptulose metabolite markers, which showed a higher relative abundance in LOC1. In contrast, MGS/CAGs belonging to <i>Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Ruminococcus</i>, and <i>Alistipes</i> were positively associated with BCAAs, cadaverine, propanoate, and lauric acid in LOC2 (Fig. <a href="#fig5">5A</a>). In addition to the positive association of BCAAs with species enriched in LOC2, a correlation analysis of significantly different (FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.05, DESeq2-based Wald test; Additional File 17) functional modules revealed that fecal BCAA abundances were positively correlated with BCAA transporter abundance in LOC2.

Higher BCAA levels in the fecal samples could be a result of its uptake by microbes via BCAA transporters, leading to their accumulation in the microbial cells detected in fecal metabolome. This is concordant with higher relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Eubacterium sireaeum</i> in LOC2 compared to LOC1, which are known to harbor higher abundance of BCAA transporters (Fig. <a href="#fig3">3C</a>) [ <a href="#bib8">8</a>]. Further support for this hypothesis emerged from the correlation of circulating BCAA levels (valine and isoleucine) in serum with the corresponding concentrations in feces. Interestingly, serum BCAA concentrations were significantly higher in LOC1 individuals as compared to LOC2 individuals, which is in contrast with their BCAA levels in the fecal metabolome (Fig. <a href="#fig6">6A</a>). Thus, one possibility is that the accumulation of BCAA in the feces of individuals of LOC2 was mediated by the inward transport of BCAA by the gut bacteria. In contrast, the lower BCAA accumulation in gut microbes and a higher BCAA biosynthesis by microbial species and its eventual absorption in serum appears to be a plausible reason for the higher BCAA concentrations in serum of LOC1 populations. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 6:</span> </a> </div>   <p>BCAA abundance and their differential correlation with LOC1 and LOC2. <b>(A)</b> Bar plot showing z-normalized values of serum and fecal BCAA (valine and isoleucine) relative concentration in LOC1 and LOC2. <b>(B)</b> The effect of specific microbial species on associations between BCAA biosynthesis pathways and BCAA levels in fecal metabolome, illustrated by change in background adjusted Spearman correlation coefficient when a given species has been excluded from analysis, is shown (see Methods).

Role of <i>Prevotella copri</i> in the regulation of BCAA levels </div> <p>To explore the differences in association of functional pathway modules between the two locations, KOs within each module were correlated with KOs from other modules using Spearman correlation coefficient. The KOs showing significant differences in correlations between LOC1 and LOC2 were identified. This differential correlation analysis of BCAA biosynthetic modules with other pathways in LOC1 and LOC2 revealed that BCAA modules were independently driven in LOC1 and LOC2 (Spearman rank correlation, FDR adj. <i>P</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Fig. S18A</a> and <a href="#sup1">S18B</a>). To identify the species and the metabolic pathways that contributed most to the BCAA abundance in fecal and serum metabolome profiles, a correlation analysis with iterations leaving each species out was performed for each metabolic module (Fig. <a href="#fig6">6B</a>). The species whose removal leads to a maximum change in the correlation of metabolic pathway with metabolite was identified and was considered as an important contributor of that metabolite. </p> <p>Notably, the BCAA biosynthesis-dependent changes in BCAA levels were largely driven by <i>Prevotella</i> species through threonine-dependent and -independent biosynthesis pathways as observed from Delta SCC <sub>bg</sub> values when genes from this species were removed (see Methods section).

Discussion</div> <p>Compositional and functional human gut microbiome studies in different populations have been instrumental in establishing the role of gut microbiome in human health [ <a href="#bib2">2</a>, <a href="#bib28">28</a>, <a href="#bib37">37</a>, <a href="#bib38">38</a>]. However, such population-specific signatures and their functional roles are yet unknown for the Indian gut microbiome. This study provides the first insights into the Indian gut microbiome represented through a cohort of 110 individuals from two prominent locations to reveal the taxonomic and functional diversity using 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic analysis, and metabolomic profiling. Although the sequencing depth was modest (1.36 ± 0.5 Gbp per sample, mean ± standard deviation), the inclusion of 110 individuals from two distinct geographic locations as well as the identification of Indian gut microbiome-specific genes provide a first insight into the Indian gut microbiome and are thus considered important additions to the field. The selection of two distinct sub-populations (Bhopal-LOC1 and Kerala-LOC2) was an important consideration to capture the microbiome variations resulting from different diets and lifestyles of these two cohorts. LOC1 provided a representation of the population from North-Central India mainly consuming a carbohydrate and fat-rich diet, whereas LOC2 represented a population from Southern India consuming an omnivorous diet with rice and animal-based products as the primary components. </p> <p>This study established the gene catalogue of the Indian gut microbiome, which provides the first insights into the yet unknown functional gut microbiome of the Indian population. The genes encoding several transposons, peptidase, glucosidase, and plant polysaccharide degradation enzymes were unique to the Indian population and not represented in other microbiome datasets. The Updated-IGC (IGC+India) constructed by the addition of unique non-redundant genes from the Indian population to the Integrated gene catalogue is likely to act as a reference dataset for gut microbiome studies for global comparative studies and particularly for studies involving South-Asian populations that have similar dietary habits and lifestyle. </p> <p>In addition to the basic housekeeping functions of the gut microbiome, which were also found abundant in other datasets, the Indian gut microbiome was enriched in functions for carbohydrate and energy metabolism including degradation of complex polysaccharides, which corroborates well with the typical carbohydrate-rich diet of the Indian population [ <a href="#bib39">39</a>]. The distant clustering of Indian samples from other populations revealed the unique composition of the Indian gut microbiota (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1B</a>). <i>Prevotella</i> emerged as the most discriminatory genus associated with the Indian population as revealed by both amplicon and MGWAS. The abundance of <i>Prevotella</i> was also indicated in the previous 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome studies of the Indian population carried out in small to medium-sized cohorts [ <a href="#bib18">18</a>, <a href="#bib19">19</a>]. Recently, <i>Prevotella</i> has been commonly observed in different non-Western communities that consume a plant-rich diet, such as in the Papua New Guineans, native Africans, rural Malawians, and BaAka pygmies [ <a href="#bib11">11</a>, <a href="#bib40">40</a>] and has also been associated with vegetarianism in the Western populations [ <a href="#bib41">41</a>, <a href="#bib42">42</a>]. However, it has not been observed at such high abundance in the Western countries so far. The MGWAS approach in this study showed the presence of <i>Megasphaera, Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Mitsuokella</i> as the other major genera associated with the Indian gut microbiome. </p> <p>Several recent studies have shown a relationship between the abundance of specific strains of <i>Prevotella</i> with inflammatory diseases, since it has a higher intrinsic capacity to stimulate Th17-mediated inflammation, which is generally not expected in a strict commensal bacterium [ <a href="#bib41">41</a>, <a href="#bib43">43</a>, <a href="#bib44">44</a>]. However, the high abundance of <i>Prevotella</i> in the healthy gut microbiome of the Indian population does not corroborate with its potential inflammatory role reported so far. Since this study was only focused on the gut microbiome of healthy individuals, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the potential inflammatory role of this species. One potential explanation could be the complex set of interactions between host genetic risk factors and environment in which the presence of <i>Prevotella</i> may be only one of the factors [ <a href="#bib45">45</a>]. Further, strain-level variations are known in the inflammatory responses and not all species of <i>Prevotella</i> could be potentially inflammatory, as also evident from the known high genetic diversity within and between the species of <i>Prevotella</i> [ <a href="#bib43">43</a>]. Thus, the high abundance of <i>Prevotella</i> in the healthy microbiota emphasizes the requirement for larger cohort studies in different populations to gain deeper insights into the potential inflammatory roles of gut microbes. </p> <p>The abundance of <i>Prevotella</i> has been associated with plant-based diets, and the typical carbohydrate-rich diet of the Indian population could be one of the reasons for the over-representation of this genus in the Indian gut microbiome [ <a href="#bib46">46</a>]. Likewise, the predominance of other microbial species from genus <i>Lactobacillus, Megasphaera</i>, and <i>Mitsuokella</i> could be due to the higher intake of fermented food and dairy products along with the carbohydrate-rich diet in LOC1 [ <a href="#bib46">46</a>, <a href="#bib47">47</a>]. Similarly, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Clostridium</i>, which were abundant in LOC2, are associated with diets rich in animal-based products, consistent with the omnivorous diet of LOC2 [ <a href="#bib42">42</a>]. Interestingly, taxonomy-based clusters 1 and 2 showed associations with the two locations LOC1 and LOC2 and also with the two KO-based clusters (C1 and C2) ( <a href="#sup1">Additional File 5</a>: <a href="#sup1">Supplementary Figs. S10</a> and <a href="#sup1">S11</a>). It is to be noted that C1 was enriched in enzymes involved in the degradation of carbohydrate and plant polysaccharides, which correlates well with the carbohydrate-rich diet in LOC1. In contrast, C2 was enriched in enzymes involved in lipid and protein degradation, which relate to the constituents of an omnivorous diet in LOC2. These observations further support the correlations between location, diet and enterotype. Although, the concept of enterotype classification is sometimes criticized due to statistical weakness in some studies, a meta-analysis of Indian samples with samples from Arumugam et al. revealed three robust clusters, with Indian samples mostly associated with enterotype-2 driven by <i>Prevotella</i> [ <a href="#bib2">2</a>]. This classification of samples from multiple population/studies into enterotypes has the potential to be clinically relevant in various aspects such as disease diagnosis, early detection of disease, biomarker development, personalized treatments, and xenobiotic metabolism [ <a href="#bib48">48</a>]. It is a representation of the major microbial species in the gut microbiome and thus appears useful for microbiome-based population stratification. A robust statistical analysis with increased sample sizes, direct clinical associations, and detailed molecular interventions are essential for further strengthening its potential. </p> <p>The study also established the previously unknown fecal metabolome of the Indian population, which showed strong clustering into three metabolomic clusters differentiated by location and diet. The metabolomic clusters also correlated well with the respective dietary habits of the two locations, where metabolomic Cluster 1 showed an association with LOC1 and was enriched in saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid, whereas metabolomic Cluster 3 showed an association with LOC2 and was enriched in BCAAs such as isoleucine, valine, and leucine and in SCFAs such as propionic acid and butyric acid. A medium chain fatty acid "lauric acid" was also found abundant in LOC2 perhaps due to the high dietary consumption of coconut oil in this location [ <a href="#bib49">49</a>, <a href="#bib50">50</a>]. Lauric acid has been reported to be beneficial by preventing fat deposition in blood vessels and acting as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative agent [ <a href="#bib51">51</a>]. </p> <p>The major BCAA "isoleucine" being produced through a less common threonine-independent pathway for isoleucine biosynthesis, and the higher enrichment of the key enzyme, D-citramalate synthase of the above pathway confirmed its higher abundance in LOC1 as compared to LOC2. Further, this pathway was found to be associated with a single species, <i>Prevotella copri</i>, as reported earlier [ <a href="#bib8">8</a>]. Taken together, it appears that the higher abundance of BCAA biosynthesis genes and a lower abundance of BCAA inward transporters in gut microbiome resulted in the lower BCAA accumulation in the fecal metabolome and higher BCAA concentration in serum as observed in LOC1 (Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>) [ <a href="#bib8">8</a>]. However, a contrasting pattern was observed in the case of LOC2, where the lower abundance of BCAA biosynthesis genes and the higher abundance of BCAA inward transporters correlated well with the higher and lower BCAA concentrations in feces and serum, respectively. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 7:</span> </a> </div>   <p>BCAA transporters playing a key role in maintaining the levels of BCAAs in feces and serum. The dynamics of BCAA concentration levels in fecal and serum metabolome influenced by microbial BCAA biosynthesis and transport pathways and their differential abundance in LOC1 and LOC2 is shown. </p>   </div> <p>The higher levels of SCFAs in LOC2 could be a consequence of the consumption of an omnivorous diet, which is associated with a Firmicutes-rich gut microbiome [ <a href="#bib52">52</a>]. SCFAs have well-established roles in human health as an energy source, an anti-inflammatory agent, and for improving intestinal homeostasis by increasing IL-18 production [ <a href="#bib53">53</a>]. In contrast, higher serum BCAA levels have well-known roles in promoting insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes (T2D) and were found to be higher in the serum in LOC1. Several reports on the role of a high-fat diet in the modulation of microbiota and alteration in intestinal barrier are emerging, with results showing increased absorption and circulating levels of BCAA and reduction of SCFAs such as butyrate, acetate, propionate, and secondary bile acids, as also noted in the case of LOC1 [ <a href="#bib54">54</a>, <a href="#bib55">55</a>]. High-fat and carbohydrate-rich diets have also been associated with an increase in abundance of Bacteroidetes (gram-negative bacteria) leading to a skewed Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio towards the former phylum [ <a href="#bib32">32</a>]. Such a ratio was also apparent in this study in LOC1 dominated by <i>Prevotella</i> from the phylum Bacteroidetes. Further, higher serum concentrations of circulating BCAA were also observed in LOC1. These results provide hints on the role of dietary habits in shaping the gut microbiome and its plausible impact on the BCAA and SCFA dynamics observed in these populations. </p> <p>To conclude, this multi-omics-based gut microbiome study of a healthy cohort from two different parts of India provides novel insights into the Indian gut microbiome and metabolome and reveals the unique gene catalogue from the poorly characterized Indian population. Further studies using higher sequencing depths and including both healthy and diseased individuals will help in obtaining more comprehensive functional and taxonomic information of gut microbiome from Indian population and its impact on human health. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Phylogenetic assignment of reads</div> <p>A total of 4,097 reference microbial genomes were obtained from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on 5 December 2015 (Additional File 18). The databases were independently indexed into two Bowtie indexes using Bowtie-2 version 2.2.9 (Bowtie 2, <a href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_016368">RRID:SCR_016368</a>) [ <a href="#bib69">69</a>]. The metagenomic reads were aligned to the reference microbial genomes using Bowtie-2. The mapped reads from both indexes were merged by selecting the alignment having the higher identity (≥90% identity). The percent identity was calculated using the formula: %identity = 100*(matches/total aligned length). The normalized abundance of a microbial genome was calculated by summing the total number of reads aligned to its reference genome. For reads showing hits to both indexed databases with equal identity, each genome was assigned 0.5 read count. The relative abundance of each genome was calculated by adding the normalized abundance of each genome divided by the total abundance. The CHI was used to calculate the variance between the clusters compared to the variance within clusters [ <a href="#bib2">2</a>]. </p> </div> <div class="constructionofcommoncoremicrobialfunctions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Construction of common core microbial functions</div> <p>To identify the core microbial functions in the gut microbiome of Indian populations and to understand their abundance compared to the other populations, the core microbiome was constructed using a similar strategy as mentioned in MetaHIT [ <a href="#bib25">25</a>]. However, to construct a comprehensive core functional microbiome, the information of essential functions from six different microbes including two strains of <i>Escherichia coli, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteric </i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was used instead of considering a single microorganism. The list of essential genes was collected from DEG database v5.0 [ <a href="#bib70">70</a>]. A total of 1,890 genes were identified as essential genes in all the six microorganisms. These genes were aligned against eggnog v4.1 database using diamond and were annotated with eggNOG ID [ <a href="#bib71">71</a>, <a href="#bib72">72</a>]. The core gut microbiome functions were also calculated using the above strategy for the US, Denmark, and Chinese population gut microbial samples to remove the variations arising due to differences in data analysis procedures. Apart from identifying the clusters that represented ≥85% genes within the range of essential gene functions, the low prevalent eggNOG functions, which were present in ≥0.0001% abundance in ≥80% of samples in that population, were further filtered out. This added filtration step helped in removing all the low abundant functions. To represent the core, the variance of these functions was also calculated between the two Indian locations. The eggNOGs showing significant deviations in variations ( <i>P</i> value≤ 0.05; Levene's test) [ <a href="#bib73">73</a>] were further filtered out from the analysis. </p> </div> <div class="constructionofmetagenomicspeciesformgwas" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Construction of metagenomic species for MGWAS</div> <p>To identify metagenomic markers using a reference-independent approach on metagenomic samples, a metagenome-wide association study was performed for 340 samples (age and gender matched) including India (both locations), US, China, and Denmark populations. The genes present in at least ≥10% of samples were considered and clustered using the canopy-mgs algorithm as described [ <a href="#bib74">74</a>]. The genes having Pearson correlation coefficient (≥0.9) were clustered into CAGs. Furthermore, the genes for which ≥90% abundance was obtained from a single sample were discarded. </p> <p>To determine the taxonomic origin of each MGS/CAG (metagenomic cluster), all the genes were aligned against reference microbial genomes of 4,097 genomes from HMP and NCBI at nucleotide level using BLASTN [ <a href="#bib75">75</a>]. The alignment hits were filtered using an E-value ≤10 <sup>−6</sup> and alignment coverage ≥80% of the gene length, and 2,773,591 (25.6%) genes showed alignments against the reference genomes. The remaining 8,049,540 unassigned genes were aligned against UNIREF database (UniRef 50) at protein sequences [ <a href="#bib76">76</a>], of which 4,553,299 genes (56.56%) could be assigned with taxonomic annotations. The sequences that found multiple top hits with equal % sequence identity and scores were further assigned taxonomy based on the lowest common ancestor method. The genes were finally assigned to taxa based on comprehensive parameters of sequence similarity across phylogenetic ranks as described earlier [ <a href="#bib77">77</a>]. The identity threshold of ≥95% was used for assignment up to species level, ≥85% identity threshold for assignment up to genus level, and ≥65% identity was used for phylum level assignment using BLASTN. The taxonomic assignments of MGS/CAGs were performed with the criteria that ≥50% genes in each MGS should map to the same lowest phylogenetic group. Thus, if a particular species is assigned ≥50% genes out of the total genes, the assignment will be carried out at species level rather than at genus or higher orders. The relative abundance of MGS/CAGs in each sample was estimated by using relative abundance values of all genes from that MGS/CAG. A Poisson distribution was fitted to the relative abundance values of the data. The mean estimated from Poisson distribution was assigned as the relative abundance of that MGS. The profile of MGS/CAGs were generated and used for further analysis. </p> </div> <div class="fecalandserummetabolomicsamplepreparationandderivatization" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Fecal and serum metabolomic sample preparation and derivatization</div> <p>Lyophilized fecal samples were used to achieve better metabolite coverage as described previously [ <a href="#bib78">78</a>]. Metabolites were extracted with 1 mL of ice-cold methanol: water (8:2) from 80 mg of lyophilized samples in a bath ultrasonicator (Bioruptor UCD-200, Diagenode) at 4°C for 30 minutes followed by 2 minutes of vortexing. The supernatant was extracted by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C and dried at 50°C under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. To remove the residual water molecules from the samples, 100 uL of toluene was added to the dry residue and evaporated completely at 50°C under nitrogen gas. Dry extracted metabolites were first derivatized with 50 uL of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine (20 mg/mL) at 60°C for 2 hours, and the second derivatization was performed with 100 uL of N-Methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) in 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 60°C for 45 minutes to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. Finally, 150 uL of the TMS derivatives was transferred into GC glass vial inserts and subjected to gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Serum samples were prepared (polar metabolites only) and derivatized as described by Psychogium et al.

Method development and validation</div> <p>Matrix dilution approach was used for validating the linearity and range of dilution [ <a href="#bib78">78</a>]. Pooled fecal samples were used to create the reference peaks to validate the peaks coming from individual samples, which were needed due to the presence of a relatively high abundance of fecal metabolites in the pooled samples. The supernatant of feces after extraction was serially diluted 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 times with methanol: water (8:2). At dilution 2, the maximum numbers of peaks were seen and were processed with the same dilution factor for all the samples. A total of 30 chemical standard mixtures and the pooled fecal samples were used to validate the method. Each stock solution of test standard was carefully prepared in deionized water or with pure ethanol (50 150 350, 500 um) for the determination of linear range, regression coefficient (R2), limit of detection, and repeatability. L-norvaline (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg/mL in ethanol) was used as a spiked external standard for the optimized derivatization of the method. </p> </div> <div class="gc-msanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

An HP-5 (25 m × 320 um × 0.25 um i.d.) fused silica capillary column (Agilent J&amp;amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA) was used with the open split interface. The injector, transfer line, and ion source temperatures were maintained at 220°C, 220°C, and 250°C, respectively. Oven temperature was programmed at 70°C for 0.2 minutes, and increased at 10°C/min to 270°C where it was sustained for 5 minutes, and further increased at 40°C/min to 310°C where it was held for 11 minutes. The MS was operated in the electron impact ionization mode at 70eV. Mass data were acquired in full scan mode from m/z 40 to 600 with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra per second. To detect retention time shifts and enable Kovats retention index (RI) calculation, a standard alkane series mixture (C10–C40) was injected periodically during the sample analysis. RIs are relative retention times normalized to n-alkanes eluted adjacently. For serum samples, we used 2 uL aliquot with a split ratio of 4:1 on the same column as described above. The injector port temperature was held at 250°C, and the helium gas flow rate was set to 1 mL/min at an initial oven temperature of 50°C. The oven temperature was increased at 10°C/min to 310°C for 11 minutes and mass data were acquired in full scan mode from m/z 40 to 600 with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra per second. </p> </div> <div class="metabolomicanalysisandmetaboliteprofilegeneration" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
