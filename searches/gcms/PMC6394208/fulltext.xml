Several large-scale, world-wide microbiome projects have revealed variability in the gut microbial composition of healthy individuals due to factors such as mode of delivery, age, geographical location, diet, and lifestyle [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref>]. The majority of the gut microbiome studies have determined microbial taxonomy and functional diversity using 16S rRNA marker gene-based and/or whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approaches to understand the functional role of the gut microbiome. However, novel insights on the complex interplay among diet, gut microbes, and human health, along with the role of key microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), derived from the microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, are beginning to emerge from recent gut metabolomics studies [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, the direct impact of microbial metabolome on human health is also becoming apparent from the recent studies focusing on the &#x0201c;gut microbiome-host metabolism axis&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, an integrative approach using both metagenome and metabolome-based characterizations of the gut microbiome appears pragmatic for gaining deeper functional and mechanistic insights into the role of gut microbes on human health.</p><p>The large-scale studies carried out so far mainly represent the gut microbiome of urban populations primarily from Europe, the United States, and other &#x0201c;WEIRD&#x0201d; countries (i.e., the Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic countries) [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Only recently, some studies have characterized the human microbiome from diverse ethnic populations and found significant compositional variations compared to the microbiomes from other previously studied populations [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref>]. India is the seventh largest country in the world and harbors the second largest population spread across multiple geographical locations with enormous diversity in ethnicity, lifestyles, and dietary habits. India is home to the majority of the world's vegetarian population but also has an almost equal representation of its population consuming animal-based diets. The Indian population also has the highest prevalence of diabetes in the world [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization estimates (WHO, 2011), 53% of deaths in India in the year 2008 were attributed to metabolic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are predicted to reach &#x0223c;75% by 2030 [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>A few studies have investigated the gut microbiome of the Indian population. A recent study by Maji et al. has shown the functional association of human gut microbiome dysbiosis with tuberculosis through a time-course study of six tuberculosis patients in India [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, other gut microbiome studies were mainly limited by small cohort sizes and amplicon-based (16S rRNA gene) sequencing and analysis [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref>]. Thus, several large-scale efforts are needed to identify the Indian population-specific microbiome biomarkers and to understand the impact of the gut microbiome on health and disease in the Indian population along with global comparisons.</p><p>However, to uncover the enormous gut microbiome diversity inherent in the different sub-populations of India, extensive sampling and analyses are required. Therefore, as the first large-scale study from India, we selected two prominent locations in North-Central India, i.e., LOC1: Bhopal city, Madhya Pradesh, and Southern India, i.e., LOC2: Kerala. The two locations also had different dietary habits. The Southern-India (LOC2) diet consisted of rice, meat, and fish, whereas the North-Central (LOC1) diet consisted of carbohydrate-rich food including plant-derived products, wheat, and trans-fat food (high-fat dairy, sweets, and fried snacks). The Human Development Index Report (UNDP; United Nations Development Programme), India and SRS-based life-table (Sample Registration Survey, 2010&#x02013;14) has revealed that the citizens from Kerala had the highest life-expectancy rates (&#x0003e;74 years) in India, whereas those in Madhya Pradesh (capital city Bhopal) exhibited the lowest (&#x0003c;65 years) [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Further, a higher predisposition of the North-Indian population towards diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension is also known, which in contrast is much lower in Southern India, perhaps due to the lifestyle differences in the two regions [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, to gain deeper functional insights into the microbiome from these two distinct sub-populations of India, a multi-omics approach was carried out using amplicon-based profiling of taxonomic composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing), WGS-based profiling of metagenome, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based profiling of fecal and serum metabolomic signatures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Data Description</title><p>The two selected locations, Bhopal (LOC1) and Kerala (LOC2) from North-Central and Southern parts of India, are about 2,000 kilometers apart and provided a distinct representation of the Indian population with respect to diet and lifestyle (Additional File 1). The 110 (62 females, 58 males) individuals recruited in this study were not suffering from any disease, as reported by personal medical history and physical examination, and confirmed no exposure to antibiotics for at least one month prior to sampling. Recruited individuals had an average body mass index (BMI) of 21.16 (&#x000b1;5.23 standard deviation), an average age of 29.72 years (&#x000b1;17.41 standard deviation), and were not diagnosed with any disease at the time of sample collection, and thus were considered as &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; (Additional File 1). Moreover, they did not have a second-degree relative history of T2D. The recruitment of volunteers, sample collection, and other study-related procedures were carried out by following the guidelines and protocols approved by the Institute Ethics Committee of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal, India. The fecal samples were frozen within 30 minutes of collection and were then used for 16S rRNA gene V3 hypervariable region amplicon sequencing, WGS-based metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic analysis. Further, the serum samples collected from a subset of volunteers were used for GC-MS-based metabolomics analysis. The sequencing of V3 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenome sequencing from the 110 fecal samples resulted in 54.87 million paired-end reads (503,460 &#x000b1; 175,547 [mean &#x000b1; standard deviation] reads/sample) and 499.98 million paired-end reads (4,545,280 &#x000b1; 1,498,663 [mean &#x000b1; standard deviation] reads/sample), respectively (Methods, Additional File 2 and Additional File 3). The metabolomic analysis was also performed on all fecal and subset of serum samples collected from the same healthy participants using GC-MS, and the resultant raw files were used for further analysis. The data description of participants and the data generated from each sample are provided in Additional File 1 under the Metadata information section.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Analyses</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Construction of an Indian gut microbial gene catalogue and updated integrated gene catalogue</title><p>The first step for functional analysis was the construction of an extensive catalogue of gut microbial genes from the Indian population, which was not available previously. A De Bruijn graph-based assembly of reads resulted in 2,165,507 contigs of length &#x02265;500 bp with a total contig size of 3.086 Gbp representing 68.25% of total reads and a mean N50 value of 2,288 bp. To obtain assemblies of low coverage genomic regions or genomes present in the Indian gut microbiome, the reads from each sample were mapped on assembled contigs obtained from their respective sample, and the remaining singletons (unassembled reads) were pooled and re-assembled together into an additional 45,839 contigs with length &#x02265;500 bp and a total assembled length of 34.68 Mbp. A total of 1,551,581 non-redundant genes were predicted from contigs, which represent the gut microbial gene catalogue of the Indian cohorts.</p><p>The integrated gene catalogue (IGC) established by Li et al. in a previous multicohort study consisted of 9,879,896 genes identified from 1,267 gut metagenomes representing multiple populations [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A total of 943,395 genes (sharing &#x0003c; 90% identity with IGC) out of 1,551,581 from the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue were identified as unique to the Indian microbial gene catalogue. The IGC was updated to construct an &#x0201c;Updated-IGC&#x0201d; by adding these 943,395 non-redundant genes from the Indian gene catalogue. The updated-IGC consisting of 10,823,291 non-redundant genes (an 8.8% increase from IGC) was used as the reference gene catalogue for the subsequent analysis performed in this study. A total of 70.74% (&#x000b1;3.77% standard deviation) mapping coverage of reads (&#x0223c;7.5% increase in the mapping of reads) was observed from the 110 Indian samples on the updated-IGC as compared to 63% (&#x000b1;4.61% standard deviation) on IGC, showing a significant (False Discovery Rate (FDR) adj. <italic>P</italic> value = 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>; Student <italic>t</italic>test) increase in mapping of Indian microbial dataset (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref> and Additional File 4). The datasets from populations in the United States (HMP), Denmark (MetaHIT), and China (a study from Qin et al.) mentioned in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref> were used for a comparative analysis of the microbiome of the Indian population with other populations [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mapping of reads from these three datasets (HMP, MetaHIT, and China) on updated-IGC (mean mapping coverage: HMP = 67.74%, MetaHIT = 75.21%, and China = 77.44%) did not show a significant (<italic>P</italic> values: HMP = 0.5, MetaHIT = 0.85, and China = 0.17; Student <italic>t</italic>test) increment from their mapping coverage on IGC (mean mapping coverage: HMP = 66.93%, MetaHIT = 75.02%, and China = 77.37%) as observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref>. This shows that the addition of a subset of non-redundant genes (sharing &#x0003c;90% identity with IGC) from the Indian gut microbiome to the IGC significantly increased (FDR adj. <italic>P</italic> value = 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>; Student <italic>t</italic>test) the mapping percentage of reads from the Indian microbiome dataset as compared to the other datasets.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>Comparison of the Indian gut microbiome with other major populations using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic datasets. <bold>(A)</bold> Percentage of total reads that could be mapped to IGC and updated IGC containing the Indian gene catalogue.

A reference-independent metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) was carried out to identify the Indian-specific gut metagenomic markers through a comparison with similar large-scale studies from other populations [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The genes from the metagenomic samples of four countries (India, China, the United States, and Denmark) were clustered (see Methods section) into 924 clusters based on their co-occurrence and Pearson correlations (&#x003c1; &#x02265; 0.9) across samples, resulting in 335 metagenomic species (MGS) having &#x02265;700 genes in each cluster, and 589 co-abundance gene groups (CAGs) consisting of &#x02265;100 genes in each cluster. Out of the 924 metagenomic clusters, 195 could be assigned up to the species level using the taxonomic assignment strategy described in the Methods section. Canberra distances were calculated from MGS/CAG abundance profiles and their principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using &#x0201c;countries&#x0201d; as factors for explaining the variance between samples, which showed that the Indian population formed a distinct cluster from the other populations in PCA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>). It is interesting to note that the samples from the Indian cohort were more widely spread owing to the higher inter-sample Canberra distances between Indian samples (mean = 0.689) as compared to other datasets having average inter-sample distances of 0.61, 0.59, and 0.54 for US, China, and Denmark populations, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 5</xref>: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). This could be attributed to the significant (FDR adj. <italic>P</italic> value = 0.00013) differences in MGS abundance profiles between LOC1 and LOC2 populations as revealed on comparison of their principal coordinates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 5</xref>: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>Further, the identification of enriched MGS from <italic>P</italic> values calculated using negative binomial (NB) model-based Wald test (implemented in DESeq2) and log odds ratio showed that the species belonging to the genera <italic>Bacteroides, Alistipes, Clostridium</italic>, and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> were depleted in the Indian population (China, Denmark, and United States; log odds ratio &#x0003c; &#x02212;2 and adj. <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.01), whereas the MGS/CAGs annotated as <italic>Prevotella, Mitsuokella, Dialister, Megasphaera</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> were found to be associated with the Indian population (adj. <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.01; log odds ratio &#x0003e; 2) and were the major drivers for separation of Indian samples from other populations (Additional File 5: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>; Additional File 6). Furthermore, the distribution of microbial families across 10 different populations was also calculated using 16S rRNA gene markers, which revealed the Indian gut microbiome to have the highest abundance of Prevotellaceae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>). The feature selection method applied using random forest along with pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test also identified Prevotellaceae to be significantly higher (FDR adj. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in gut microbiome of Indian cohort compared to the other population datasets except Indonesia (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.506) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figs.

In total 69,386 EggNOG functions were identified from the Indian gut microbiome, including 2,328 novel functions obtained from clustering the unmapped genes (see Methods section). The core microbial functions that are essential for microbial survival and present in almost 80% individuals were used for the functional comparison. The core microbiome was derived using a similar strategy as employed in MetaHIT (see Methods section) [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

The eggNOG abundance profile generated from relative abundances of genes observed in Indian and other population datasets were ranked based on their mean abundance in descending order. The range of eggNOGs that included 85% of the 1,890 essential genes were considered as a part of the core microbial eggNOG set for each population dataset and was used for the analysis.

The proportion of essential genes covered by top-ranking eggNOG clusters showed that 85% of the essential genes could be covered in the least number (15,300) of eggNOGs in the case of Indian population, whereas it was covered by a higher number of eggNOGs in the case of US (20,400), China (19,900), and Denmark (30,900) populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 5</xref>: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). These observations suggest that the core functional microbiome of Indian population is less diverse than the other populations.

To identify the species and the metabolic pathways that contributed most to the BCAA abundance in fecal and serum metabolome profiles, a correlation analysis with iterations leaving each species out was performed for each metabolic module (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>).

Further, BCAA biosynthesis pathways were found to be higher in LOC1, whereas BCAA transporters were higher in LOC2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>), leading to the dynamic changes in BCAA concentrations in fecal and serum metabolome in LOC1 and LOC2 as observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Compositional and functional human gut microbiome studies in different populations have been instrumental in establishing the role of gut microbiome in human health [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, such population-specific signatures and their functional roles are yet unknown for the Indian gut microbiome. This study provides the first insights into the Indian gut microbiome represented through a cohort of 110 individuals from two prominent locations to reveal the taxonomic and functional diversity using 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic analysis, and metabolomic profiling. Although the sequencing depth was modest (1.36 &#x000b1; 0.5 Gbp per sample, mean &#x000b1; standard deviation), the inclusion of 110 individuals from two distinct geographic locations as well as the identification of Indian gut microbiome-specific genes provide a first insight into the Indian gut microbiome and are thus considered important additions to the field. The selection of two distinct sub-populations (Bhopal-LOC1 and Kerala-LOC2) was an important consideration to capture the microbiome variations resulting from different diets and lifestyles of these two cohorts. LOC1 provided a representation of the population from North-Central India mainly consuming a carbohydrate and fat-rich diet, whereas LOC2 represented a population from Southern India consuming an omnivorous diet with rice and animal-based products as the primary components.</p><p>This study established the gene catalogue of the Indian gut microbiome, which provides the first insights into the yet unknown functional gut microbiome of the Indian population. The genes encoding several transposons, peptidase, glucosidase, and plant polysaccharide degradation enzymes were unique to the Indian population and not represented in other microbiome datasets. The Updated-IGC (IGC+India) constructed by the addition of unique non-redundant genes from the Indian population to the Integrated gene catalogue is likely to act as a reference dataset for gut microbiome studies for global comparative studies and particularly for studies involving South-Asian populations that have similar dietary habits and lifestyle.</p><p>In addition to the basic housekeeping functions of the gut microbiome, which were also found abundant in other datasets, the Indian gut microbiome was enriched in functions for carbohydrate and energy metabolism including degradation of complex polysaccharides, which corroborates well with the typical carbohydrate-rich diet of the Indian population [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The distant clustering of Indian samples from other populations revealed the unique composition of the Indian gut microbiota (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>). <italic>Prevotella</italic> emerged as the most discriminatory genus associated with the Indian population as revealed by both amplicon and MGWAS. The abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> was also indicated in the previous 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome studies of the Indian population carried out in small to medium-sized cohorts [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recently, <italic>Prevotella</italic> has been commonly observed in different non-Western communities that consume a plant-rich diet, such as in the Papua New Guineans, native Africans, rural Malawians, and BaAka pygmies [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and has also been associated with vegetarianism in the Western populations [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, it has not been observed at such high abundance in the Western countries so far. The MGWAS approach in this study showed the presence of <italic>Megasphaera, Lactobacillus</italic>, and <italic>Mitsuokella</italic> as the other major genera associated with the Indian gut microbiome.</p><p>Several recent studies have shown a relationship between the abundance of specific strains of <italic>Prevotella</italic> with inflammatory diseases, since it has a higher intrinsic capacity to stimulate Th17-mediated inflammation, which is generally not expected in a strict commensal bacterium [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the high abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> in the healthy gut microbiome of the Indian population does not corroborate with its potential inflammatory role reported so far. Since this study was only focused on the gut microbiome of healthy individuals, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the potential inflammatory role of this species. One potential explanation could be the complex set of interactions between host genetic risk factors and environment in which the presence of <italic>Prevotella</italic> may be only one of the factors [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Further, strain-level variations are known in the inflammatory responses and not all species of <italic>Prevotella</italic> could be potentially inflammatory, as also evident from the known high genetic diversity within and between the species of <italic>Prevotella</italic> [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, the high abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> in the healthy microbiota emphasizes the requirement for larger cohort studies in different populations to gain deeper insights into the potential inflammatory roles of gut microbes.</p><p>The abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> has been associated with plant-based diets, and the typical carbohydrate-rich diet of the Indian population could be one of the reasons for the over-representation of this genus in the Indian gut microbiome [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Likewise, the predominance of other microbial species from genus <italic>Lactobacillus, Megasphaera</italic>, and <italic>Mitsuokella</italic> could be due to the higher intake of fermented food and dairy products along with the carbohydrate-rich diet in LOC1 [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic>, which were abundant in LOC2, are associated with diets rich in animal-based products, consistent with the omnivorous diet of LOC2 [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Interestingly, taxonomy-based clusters 1 and 2 showed associations with the two locations LOC1 and LOC2 and also with the two KO-based clusters (C1 and C2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 5</xref>: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figs. S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S11</xref>). It is to be noted that C1 was enriched in enzymes involved in the degradation of carbohydrate and plant polysaccharides, which correlates well with the carbohydrate-rich diet in LOC1. In contrast, C2 was enriched in enzymes involved in lipid and protein degradation, which relate to the constituents of an omnivorous diet in LOC2. These observations further support the correlations between location, diet and enterotype. Although, the concept of enterotype classification is sometimes criticized due to statistical weakness in some studies, a meta-analysis of Indian samples with samples from Arumugam et al. revealed three robust clusters, with Indian samples mostly associated with enterotype-2 driven by <italic>Prevotella</italic> [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This classification of samples from multiple population/studies into enterotypes has the potential to be clinically relevant in various aspects such as disease diagnosis, early detection of disease, biomarker development, personalized treatments, and xenobiotic metabolism [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is a representation of the major microbial species in the gut microbiome and thus appears useful for microbiome-based population stratification. A robust statistical analysis with increased sample sizes, direct clinical associations, and detailed molecular interventions are essential for further strengthening its potential.</p><p>The study also established the previously unknown fecal metabolome of the Indian population, which showed strong clustering into three metabolomic clusters differentiated by location and diet. The metabolomic clusters also correlated well with the respective dietary habits of the two locations, where metabolomic Cluster 1 showed an association with LOC1 and was enriched in saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid, whereas metabolomic Cluster 3 showed an association with LOC2 and was enriched in BCAAs such as isoleucine, valine, and leucine and in SCFAs such as propionic acid and butyric acid. A medium chain fatty acid &#x0201c;lauric acid&#x0201d; was also found abundant in LOC2 perhaps due to the high dietary consumption of coconut oil in this location [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Lauric acid has been reported to be beneficial by preventing fat deposition in blood vessels and acting as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative agent [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>The major BCAA &#x0201c;isoleucine&#x0201d; being produced through a less common threonine-independent pathway for isoleucine biosynthesis, and the higher enrichment of the key enzyme, D-citramalate synthase of the above pathway confirmed its higher abundance in LOC1 as compared to LOC2. Further, this pathway was found to be associated with a single species, <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>, as reported earlier [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Taken together, it appears that the higher abundance of BCAA biosynthesis genes and a lower abundance of BCAA inward transporters in gut microbiome resulted in the lower BCAA accumulation in the fecal metabolome and higher BCAA concentration in serum as observed in LOC1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, a contrasting pattern was observed in the case of LOC2, where the lower abundance of BCAA biosynthesis genes and the higher abundance of BCAA inward transporters correlated well with the higher and lower BCAA concentrations in feces and serum, respectively.</p><fig id="fig7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7:</label><caption><p>BCAA transporters playing a key role in maintaining the levels of BCAAs in feces and serum.

SCFAs have well-established roles in human health as an energy source, an anti-inflammatory agent, and for improving intestinal homeostasis by increasing IL-18 production [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In contrast, higher serum BCAA levels have well-known roles in promoting insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes (T2D) and were found to be higher in the serum in LOC1. Several reports on the role of a high-fat diet in the modulation of microbiota and alteration in intestinal barrier are emerging, with results showing increased absorption and circulating levels of BCAA and reduction of SCFAs such as butyrate, acetate, propionate, and secondary bile acids, as also noted in the case of LOC1 [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. High-fat and carbohydrate-rich diets have also been associated with an increase in abundance of Bacteroidetes (gram-negative bacteria) leading to a skewed Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio towards the former phylum [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Such a ratio was also apparent in this study in LOC1 dominated by <italic>Prevotella</italic> from the phylum Bacteroidetes. Further, higher serum concentrations of circulating BCAA were also observed in LOC1. These results provide hints on the role of dietary habits in shaping the gut microbiome and its plausible impact on the BCAA and SCFA dynamics observed in these populations.</p><p>To conclude, this multi-omics-based gut microbiome study of a healthy cohort from two different parts of India provides novel insights into the Indian gut microbiome and metabolome and reveals the unique gene catalogue from the poorly characterized Indian population. Further studies using higher sequencing depths and including both healthy and diseased individuals will help in obtaining more comprehensive functional and taxonomic information of gut microbiome from Indian population and its impact on human health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec5-1"><title>Study design and subject enrollment</title><p>The study cohort consisted of 110 healthy individuals belonging to different age groups from infants (&#x0003c;1 year) to aged (&#x0003e;50 years), with an average subject age of 29.72 &#x000b1; 17.4 years (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) from two different locations across India, i.e., Bhopal (LOC1, n = 53) and Kerala (LOC2, n = 57), which are separated by &#x0223c;1000 miles.

A Poisson distribution was fitted to the relative abundance values of the data. The mean estimated from Poisson distribution was assigned as the relative abundance of that MGS. The profile of MGS/CAGs were generated and used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-10"><title>Fecal and serum metabolomic sample preparation and derivatization</title><p>Lyophilized fecal samples were used to achieve better metabolite coverage as described previously [<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Metabolites were extracted with 1 mL of ice-cold methanol: water (8:2) from 80 mg of lyophilized samples in a bath ultrasonicator (Bioruptor UCD-200, Diagenode) at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes followed by 2 minutes of vortexing. The supernatant was extracted by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and dried at 50&#x000b0;C under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. To remove the residual water molecules from the samples, 100 uL of toluene was added to the dry residue and evaporated completely at 50&#x000b0;C under nitrogen gas. Dry extracted metabolites were first derivatized with 50 uL of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine (20 mg/mL) at 60&#x000b0;C for 2 hours, and the second derivatization was performed with 100 uL of N-Methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) in 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 60&#x000b0;C for 45 minutes to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. Finally, 150 uL of the TMS derivatives was transferred into GC glass vial inserts and subjected to gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Serum samples were prepared (polar metabolites only) and derivatized as described by Psychogium et al.

Pooled fecal samples were used to create the reference peaks to validate the peaks coming from individual samples, which were needed due to the presence of a relatively high abundance of fecal metabolites in the pooled samples. The supernatant of feces after extraction was serially diluted 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 times with methanol: water (8:2). At dilution 2, the maximum numbers of peaks were seen and were processed with the same dilution factor for all the samples. A total of 30 chemical standard mixtures and the pooled fecal samples were used to validate the method. Each stock solution of test standard was carefully prepared in deionized water or with pure ethanol (50&#x000a0;150 350, 500 um) for the determination of linear range, regression coefficient (R2), limit of detection, and repeatability. L-norvaline (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg/mL in ethanol) was used as a spiked external standard for the optimized derivatization of the method.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-12"><title>GC-MS analysis</title><p>GC-MS analysis was performed on an in-house Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with 5975C MS system. An HP-5 (25 m &#x000d7; 320 um &#x000d7; 0.25 um i.d.) fused silica capillary column (Agilent J&#x00026;W Scientific, Folsom, CA) was used with the open split interface. The injector, transfer line, and ion source temperatures were maintained at 220&#x000b0;C, 220&#x000b0;C, and 250&#x000b0;C, respectively. Oven temperature was programmed at 70&#x000b0;C for 0.2 minutes, and increased at 10&#x000b0;C/min to 270&#x000b0;C where it was sustained for 5 minutes, and further increased at 40&#x000b0;C/min to 310&#x000b0;C where it was held for 11 minutes. The MS was operated in the electron impact ionization mode at 70eV. Mass data were acquired in full scan mode from m/z 40 to 600 with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra per second. To detect retention time shifts and enable Kovats retention index (RI) calculation, a standard alkane series mixture (C10&#x02013;C40) was injected periodically during the sample analysis. RIs are relative retention times normalized to n-alkanes eluted adjacently. For serum samples, we used 2 uL aliquot with a split ratio of 4:1 on the same column as described above. The injector port temperature was held at 250&#x000b0;C, and the helium gas flow rate was set to 1 mL/min at an initial oven temperature of 50&#x000b0;C. The oven temperature was increased at 10&#x000b0;C/min to 310&#x000b0;C for 11 minutes and mass data were acquired in full scan mode from m/z 40 to 600 with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra per second.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-13"><title>Metabolomic analysis and metabolite profile generation</title><p>Raw CDF files were used for peak identification and filtering, and the XCMS package in R was used for pre-processing of the peaks.
