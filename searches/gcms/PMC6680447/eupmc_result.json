    "Origanum species are plants rich in volatile oils that are mainly used for culinary purposes. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the biological activities of their essential oils. Origanum onites L. is a plant mainly found in Greece, Turkey, and Sicily, whose oil is rich in carvacrol, a highly bioactive phytochemical. The aim of this study was to analyze the chemical composition of Origanum onites essential oil (OOEO), and investigate its potential anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. GC/MS analysis identified carvacrol as OOEO's main constituent. In vitro antiproliferative activity was assayed with the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay against human cancer cell lines from four tumor types. HT-29, a colorectal cancer cell line, was the most sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of OOEO. Wound-healing assay and Annexin V-PI staining were employed to investigate the antimigratory and the pro-apoptotic potential of OOEO, respectively, against human (HT-29) and murine (CT26) colon cancer cells. Notably, OOEO attenuated migration and induced apoptosis-related morphological changes in both cell lines. Prophylactic oral administration of the oil in a BALB/c experimental mouse model inhibited the growth of syngeneic CT26 colon tumors. As far as we know, this is the first report on the antitumor potential of orally administered OOEO."
