While the main function of white adipose tissue (WAT) is the storage of energy in the form of triacylglycerols, the specialized brown adipose tissue (BAT) utilizes nutrients to produce heat, a process known as non-shivering or adaptive thermogenesis <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This process is made possible by the activity of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) which is exclusively expressed in brown adipocytes. Located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it uncouples the mitochondrial proton gradient from ATP production. Activation of UCP1 and mitochondrial thermogenesis depend on the &#x003b2;3-adrenergic receptor which is activated by noradrenaline released by sympathetic neurons in response to cold. It is well-established that BAT is present and metabolically active in adult humans and localizes mainly to the neck and upper body regions <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A second type of UCP1-expressing adipocytes, the beige or brite (brown-in-white) adipocytes, occur in WAT depots and are recruited upon prolonged cold exposure or direct adrenergic stimulation, in a process known as browning <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">Aging is a negative regulator of brown adipocyte formation and function. In humans, loss of BAT mass is observed with increasing age and is accompanied by attenuated activation of thermogenesis <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Similar findings have also been reported in rodent models <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This loss of thermogenic capacity may be due to a phenotypic switch described as whitening, e.g. the conversion of brown into white-like adipose tissue, which is accompanied by reduced UCP1 expression and activity <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The thermogenic defect has also been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction of mature brown adipocytes and reduced proliferative expansion of brown adipogenic progenitor cells <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Further, brown adipose tissue may lose the ability to respond to adrenergic stimulation due to a defect in post-receptor signaling events <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">Brown and white adipose tissues are endocrine organs that secrete a range of hormones and metabolites, thereby regulating metabolic homeostasis. Several lines of evidence suggest that secreted products of adipose tissue lipid metabolism, the lipokines, may contribute essential regulatory cues to integrate nutrient handling in adipose tissues and other organs, thereby affecting systemic lipid homeostasis as well as the development of metabolic dysfunction <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. For instance, cardiolipins in BAT were recently described as important regulators of energy metabolism <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and the thermogenic lipokine, 12,13-diHOME, is involved in the activation of BAT in response to cold, leading to an increase of fatty acid uptake <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This is important since excess serum fatty acids (FA) may trigger inflammatory responses by activating toll-like receptors (TLRs) which could lead to insulin resistance <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In dysfunctional adipose tissue, an increased appearance of lipotoxic intermediates, such as ceramides and diacylglycerols (DAG), has been observed <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. DAGs can activate certain protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms which inhibit insulin signaling in liver and muscle <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Additionally, fatty acids are precursors for the biosynthesis of ceramides, which have been linked to oxidative stress, lipotoxicity and inhibition of insulin signaling <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Prevention of ceramide production by inhibition of ceramide synthases in turn promotes the browning of WAT and improves glucose and lipid metabolism <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="p0045">In summary, the effects of various lipid species on adipose tissue could play a central role in the emergence of metabolic pathologies, such as adiposity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. However, very little is known about age-related changes of lipid metabolites in BAT, their involvement in BAT-dysfunction and the contribution of this process to metabolic disorders. To identify functional lipid biomarkers of brown adipose tissue aging, we combined metabolomic and proteomic analyses to compare BAT and WAT from mice collected at different ages. These correlational analyses reveal that changes of several lipid classes and individual metabolite species correlate with adipose tissue aging. Among these, sphingolipids are significantly induced in aged BAT. Uncovering a potential function of this lipid class in age-related BAT-dysfunction, we show that ceramides and activation of sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling inhibit the thermogenic potential of brown adipocytes. Dolichols, a group of prenolic lipid-derivatives that function as substrates for the enzyme dolichol kinase, are increased in aged BAT and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). Modulation of dolichol kinase expression inversely correlates with brown adipogenesis. Our findings show that age-related alterations of lipid metabolism may result in increased formation of bioactive lipid species in adipose tissues that exert detrimental effects on brown/beige adipocyte formation and thermogenic function.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Tissue collection</title><p id="p0050">All procedures were approved by the ethics committee for animal welfare of the State Office of Environment, Health, and Consumer Protection (State of Brandenburg, Germany).

Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using Nano-LC-ESI-MSMS (Orbitrap Elite, Thermo Fisher Scientific; Schwerte, Germany). The processed MS/MS spectra and MASCOT server (version 2.2, Matrix Science Ltd., London) were used to search in-house against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database MOUSE 2013okt (51193 sequences; 24573350 residues). The maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed and the mass tolerance of precursor and sequence ions was set to 10&#x000a0;ppm and 0.35&#x000a0;Da, respectively. Acrylamide modification of cysteine, methionine oxidation, and C-terminal 18O1- and 18O2-isotope labeling were considered as possible modifications.

The lipid analysis resulted in the detection of a broad range of candidates, including many intermediate metabolites of biochemical processes but also a range of different lipids species (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S5</xref>). When we selected candidates based on significant correlations with aging, 68 metabolites were identified, with 48 of them being different lipid species which could be roughly grouped into five distinct classes, including four carnitine-coupled fatty acids, 31 phospholipids, three sphingolipids, and ten triacylglycerols (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S5</xref>). Interestingly, among the triacylglycerols that showed a significant negative correlation to aging, four triacylglycerols containing very short chain fatty acids (VSCFA-TG) with two to five carbon atoms in their fatty acid moieties were detected. VSCFA-TAGs were identified in positive MS ionization mode from the [M&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;NH4]+ precursor with subsequent identification of fatty acid composition on the basis of AcylOOH&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;NH3 neutral loss fragmentation (fragmentation patterns summarized in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S6</xref>).

Binding of S1P to its G-protein coupled receptors mediates pleiotropic effects in different cell types and very little is known about their role in regulating brown adipocyte formation and function. We therefore treated primary brown APCs with increasing concentrations of S1P during differentiation, which was combined with or without short-term adrenergic stimulation by NE. While the treatment with S1P had no effect on the expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A) or <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B) under basal conditions, a dose-dependent attenuation of NE-stimulated gene expression was detected during co-exposure to S1P, altogether suggesting a negative effect of S1P on brown adipogenesis. To determine the relative contribution of the different receptors on S1P-signaling in adipogenic cells, we next compared expression of all five receptor types in adipose tissue and purified APCs of BAT and iWAT. Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor type 1 (<italic>S1pr1</italic>), <italic>S1pr4</italic>, and <italic>S1pr5</italic> were expressed in both types of adipose tissue at higher levels compared to the respective APC-isolates.

We next used specific antagonists to specifically inhibit receptors during adipogenic differentiation, using either VPC23019 (VPC) to target S1P receptor types 1 and 3 (S1PR1, 3) simultaneously, S1PR2 by using JTE013 (JTE), or S1PR4 by using CYM50358 (CYM). Under these conditions of reduced S1P-signaling, <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression was significantly induced in cells treated with antagonists of S1PR2 (JTE) and S1PR4 (CYM), whereas no effects on expression of adipogenic differentiation marker <italic>Pparg</italic> were detected by any of the inhibitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>D). Although <italic>S1pr3</italic> expression was expressed in APCs to the same extent as in whole tissue (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4B</xref>), no effect of the antagonist on brown adipogenesis was detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>D). <italic>S1pr2</italic> was found to be highly expressed in adipose tissue and APCs whereas <italic>S1pr4</italic> was highly expressed in whole adipose tissue but not in APCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>C). Due to its particularly high expression in APCs and the induction of <italic>Ucp1</italic> following S1PR2-inhibition, we concluded that <italic>S1pr2</italic> may be the most relevant subtype to control brown adipocyte progenitor cells.

Of note, the effects of S1PR2 inhibition were more potent when cells were exposed at later time windows during the differentiation time course, while no or very little effect was observed when cells were only treated before or in the early phases of adipogenesis, which may indicate that altered S1P-signaling is required throughout differentiation to impact brown adipogenesis (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4D, E</xref>).

Here we show that aging results in defective lipid metabolism in BAT and WAT on the functional and the proteome level by targeting the ability of brown adipocytes to mobilize lipids after adrenergic stimulation. Exploring this observation, we identify several potential lipid species that may be used as biomarkers of the functional decline of brown adipocytes during aging, including very short chain fatty acid-containing triglycerides, sphingolipids, and dolichols. As a functional consequence of age-related alterations of these biomarkers, ceramides and their metabolic product, S1P, attenuate differentiation of brown pre-adipocytes and attenuate their metabolic function, in part due to S1P receptor activation. Similarly, elevated dolichol metabolism and increased expression of dolichol kinase may exacerbate metabolic defects by inhibiting brown adipocyte formation and function.</p><p id="p0180">Reduced BAT mass, lower thermogenic capacity, and the inability of WAT to undergo cold-induced browning have all been described in rodent and human aging <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. On the molecular level, this may be due to reduced expression of the unique brown adipocyte marker <italic>Ucp1</italic>, reduced pre-adipocyte activation and differentiation or an attenuated adrenergic response to cold <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The age-dependent decrease of adipose tissue hormone-sensitivity <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> could be related to molecular changes within the adipocytes themselves, rather than the reduced adrenergic stimulus since circulating norepinephrine is elevated, rather than decreased, in cold-exposed aged rats compared to young controls <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the sympathetic stimulus at the tissue level may be unrelated to circulating norepinephrine and could be related to a changed quality of neuronal input to BAT during aging. Related to this, we observed increased expression of myogenic markers in aged BAT in our study. This effect is potentially comparable to a recent study where activation of AgRP-neuron activity changed the transcriptional profile of brown fat towards elevated expression of a wide array of myogenic genes and was linked to impaired BAT function <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Whether the age-dependent increase of myogenic marker expression is to some extent related to changes of AgRP-neuron activity remains to be elucidated. In summary, it is clear that multiple mechanisms may contribute to aged BAT dysfunction. The composition of the local microenvironment as well as endocrine and neuronal signals acting on brown adipogenic stem cells or mature brown adipocytes may provide key elements of this negative regulation.</p><p id="p0185">Secondly, since brown adipocytes do not normally occur as a pure population, especially in humans, biomarkers representing the number of brown adipocytes and their ability to conduct thermogenesis are of particular interest to test clinical applications. We here show that several lipid species may fulfill these prerequisites while also exerting regulatory impulses on brown adipocytes. Of particular interest is a relatively unusual group of triglycerides incorporating very short chain fatty acids (VSCFA), such as acetate (C2) and butyrate (C4). To our knowledge, the comparably high abundance of these triglyceride species in BAT compared to WAT, and their inverse correlation to age, have not previously been reported. This subgroup of fatty acids is produced mostly in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial fermentation. After absorption, VSCFA are taken up by peripheral tissues and could directly impinge on energy metabolism by activation of the short chain fatty acid-activated G-protein coupled receptors GPR41 and GPR43 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Notably, sodium acetate has also been shown to decrease phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase in 3T3L1 (white) adipocytes <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and the inhibition of lipolysis by short chain fatty acids has been confirmed in humans as well as other experimental systems <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Loss of GPR43 also benefits metabolic health by increasing energy expenditure, improving glucose control and instating resistance to diet-induced obesity <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It is currently unknown whether short chain fatty acids are incorporated into triglycerides through the same mechanism as longer-chain fatty acids. In this study, we identified 20 such lipid species, of which several were significantly down-regulated by aging, containing either acetate or butyrate with high abundance in BAT in comparison to iWAT, thereby making VSCFA-TGs possible biomarkers of BAT aging. It remains to be determined whether VSCFA-TGs are solely biomarkers or may influence brown adipocyte thermogenesis by activating distinct signaling pathways due to controlled release of short chain fatty acids.</p><p id="p0190">In our analysis, different types of phospholipids are, in general, positively correlated with aging. Phospholipids, and particularly phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylcholines, are the main components of biological membranes and regulate membrane fluidity of eukaryotic cells <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. While it is difficult to link such associations directly to changes in membrane function or other cellular processes involving phospholipids, some studies at least suggest that age-related changes to distinct phospholipids species also occur in other contexts. Increased levels of ether-phospholipids, but not total phospholipids, and elevated desaturation in PL-bound fatty acids have previously been described for visceral white adipose tissue <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, which is consistent with the hypothesis of altered membrane fluidity, thickness and mechanical resistance <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and may also be related to increased adipocyte size in aged tissue samples. While the changes to fatty acid profiles are generally consistent with our own data from iWAT, the changes in BAT seem generally milder, which could be due to the age at which fatty acids profiles were assessed. Interestingly, the role of acyl-carnitine metabolism could also be related to these observations. Among the classes of lipids down-regulated by aging, we observed several fatty acid-carnitine conjugates, which are involved in fatty acid transfer into mitochondria through the carnitine acyltransferase system. Of note, phospholipids are also downregulated in aging heart mitochondria and treatment of such mitochondria with acetyl-carnitine reverted this negative effect of aging, suggesting a potential mechanistic link between alterations in phospholipids and acyl-carnitine metabolites <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In line with these observations, the ratios of &#x003c9;6/&#x003c9;3 fatty acids in phospholipids became more unfavorable in aged BAT and iWAT, a development that has also been linked to metabolic disorders <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p id="p0195">A metabolic connection between phospholipids, specifically phosphatidylcholines, and sphingolipids is well established. Our findings show that enrichment of ceramides in aged BAT and iWAT impairs brown adipogenesis and may affect the mitochondrial function of mature adipocytes independent of differentiation, while inhibition of endogenous ceramide synthesis augments mitochondrial function in differentiating brown adipogenic progenitor cells. This corroborates the previous observation that tissue-specific ablation of ceramide synthases in murine BAT or liver leads to an increase in energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity by enhancing thermogenesis in BAT <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Consistent with these observations, it was also reported that pharmacological inhibition of ceramide synthase stimulates browning of iWAT and increases insulin sensitivity, indicating that high synthesis rates of ceramides may indeed impair metabolic health of adipose tissues <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p id="p0200">The signaling molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which is linked to ceramides as part of a biological rheostat, is often characterized as the counterpart of ceramides <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Somewhat contradictory, our data indicate a negative effect of S1P on the expression of brown adipogenic genes, whereas inhibition of S1P-signaling through its type 2 receptor, S1PR2, has the opposite effect. Reiterating this potential negative role of S1P in metabolic processes, it was reported that S1P concentrations in adipose tissue of obese subjects are increased <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Another study also showed that metabolic health and heat production were inversely correlated with circulating S1P levels. However, administration of S1P did not influence thermogenesis in this study, and neither was an agonist of S1PR1 effective, which is consistent with our own observations on this receptor, while S1PR2 was not tested <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.</p><p id="p0205">The stimulatory effect of S1PR2-inhibition occurs independently of adrenergic stimulation, but has no additive effect when cells were co-stimulated with a &#x003b2;-agonist. Since both receptors are G-protein coupled, and &#x003b2;3AR is coupled to a stimulatory G-protein, it stands to reason that S1PR2 may be coupled to a G-protein that counteracts the adrenergic signaling cascade. While the coupling of S1PR2 in brown adipocytes is unclear, it is known to couple to different types of G-proteins, including G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>q</sub>
<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. G<sub>q</sub> is a known negative regulator of brown adipocyte thermogenesis <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. The negative effect of G<sub>i</sub> on brown adipocytes has also been proposed before, and cold exposure has been shown to decrease G<sub>i</sub> expression in BAT <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. More importantly, an age-related increase of inhibitory G-proteins has been reported in adipocytes of aged rats <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. In summary, these findings suggest that aging may result in altered concentrations of different sphingolipid species, including ceramides and S1P, which may attenuate brown adipocyte formation and their metabolic function.</p><p id="p0210">Dolichols are established biomarkers of aging in different rodent and human tissues <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. These isoprenoid chain-containing lipids are synthesized through the mevalonate pathway, which gives rise to important lipid mediators such as sterols and ubiquinones. Dolichols are alpha-saturated polyisoprenoids with a backbone of 14&#x02013;24 isoprene subunits spanning all mammalian membranes. In the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, dolichols are the anchors for oligosaccharide synthesis for subsequent asparagine-linked N-glycosylation <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Our data show a strong accumulation of dolichols with variable isoprenoid chain lengths in BAT and iWAT of aged mice. Interestingly, it was shown that PC and PE, two lipid species upregulated by aging in BAT, activate dolichol kinase (<italic>Dolk</italic>), an enzyme which is highly expressed in BAT and phosphorylates dolichols to form bioactive lipids <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In our study, expression levels of <italic>Dolk</italic> were induced during aging and, in gain- and loss-of-function models, inversely correlated with thermogenic gene expression in brown adipocytes and may therefore participate in the age-related inhibition of BAT function. An upregulation of the enzymatic activity of <italic>Dolk</italic> may lead to different defects, including a more generalized endoplasmic reticulum stress due to attenuation of N-glycosylation and maturation of proteins, which requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0215">The impairment of brown adipogenesis and mature brown adipocyte function may exacerbate metabolic diseases during aging and could at least in part be due to changed levels of different bioactive lipid species. The identification of biomarkers of BAT-aging, including regulatory metabolites that directly affect brown adipocyte formation and thermogenesis is necessary to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of BAT regulation. We identify several lipid metabolites that are important regulators of brown adipocyte gene expression and therefore may serve as pharmaceutical targets to counter the age-related onset of obesity and metabolic complications.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0220">T.J.S and S.G. conceived experiments, analyzed the majority of the data, and wrote the manuscript.
