    "This study deals with the ecology, phytochemistry, and biological activity investigation of Euphorbia retusa, belonging to Euphorbiaceae family, obtained from Egypt. Ecologically, Euphorbia retusa secretes white sap inhibiting the growth of the other species, so Euphorbia retusa is forming complete patches. Phytochemical study of the plant was visualized intensively based on its extraction with a protic organic solvent, working up and purifying its entire bioactive compounds using a series of different chromatographic techniques. A broad range of diverse compounds were isolated, namely, 1-hexacosanol (1), 3β-hydroxy-24-methylene-9,19-cyclolanostane; 24-methylenecycloartanol (2), 3β-hydroxy-9,19-cyclolanostane; cyclolaudanol (3), 3β,24S-Ergost-5-en-ol (4), and methyllinoleate. Additionally, GC-MS analysis of the unpolar fractions detected the existence of n-dodecane, methyllaurate, 6,10,14-trimethyl-pentadecan-2-one (5), 6,10-dimethyl-undecan-2-one (6), 2-methyl-hexadecanal (7), methylpalmitate, methyl-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate (8), and n-heneicosane (9). A full assignment for compounds 2 and 3 using 1 and 2 DNMR was carried out herein for the first time. The antimicrobial activity of the strain extract and obtained compounds was studied using a panel of pathogenic bacterial strains. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the compounds as well as the crude extract was studied against the human cervix carcinoma cell line (KB-3-1)."
