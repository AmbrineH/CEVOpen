Yet, for many hydrocarbonoclastic strains the genetic information regarding pollutant degradation and detoxification has not been thoroughly revealed. In this study, hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were isolated from a long-term oil-polluted soil in B&#x000f3;brka, Poland. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. was the most dominant species. Of all 69 isolated strains tested in the laboratory using qualitative biochemical assays, 61% showed the capability to use diesel as sole carbon source, 33% could produce indole, 19% produced siderophores, 36% produced organic acids, and 54% were capable of producing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)-deaminase. From all morphologically and genetically different strains, two representative <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., strain VI4.1 and VI4T1, were selected for genome sequencing. Genomic analyses indicated the presence of the full naphthalene dioxygenase operon (plasmid and chromosomal), of genes involved in the degradation of BTEX compounds (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylene) and alkanes (<italic>alkB</italic> gene) as well as the anthranilate degradation pathway (strain VI4T1) and terephthalate dioxygenase protein (strain VI4.1). Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) analyses confirmed naphthalene and BTEX degradation within seven days. Motility, resistance to abiotic stresses, high and low temperatures, low pH, and salinity were confirmed at the genetic level and experimentally verified. The presence of multiple degradative and plant growth promotion genes, together with the in vitro experimental evidence, indicates the high value of these two strains and their potential use for sustainable site clean-up. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>naphthalene</kwd><kwd>toluene</kwd><kwd>hydrocarbons</kwd><kwd>plant growth promotion</kwd><kwd>bioremediation</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas</italic></kwd><kwd>soil pollution</kwd><kwd>phytoremediation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-genes-10-00443"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Environmental spills with recalcitrant pollutants such as mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs, PAHs) are a problem worldwide, threatening the environment and human health [<xref rid="B1-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many of the diverse group of aromatic hydrocarbons are classified as priority pollutants by the US Environmental Protection Agency [<xref rid="B2-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Naphthalene has also been classified as a group C possible human carcinogen. When oil spill accidents occur on land, degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by indigenous microorganisms is often a slower process to remediate contaminated areas in comparison to traditional physical and chemical remediation treatments, often due to low microbial numbers and activity [<xref rid="B3-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Microbial bioremediation, the process of pollutant degradation by microorganisms, is a green, cheap, and safe approach to cleaning up polluted sites [<xref rid="B4-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This process can be improved by promoting the growth of endogenous bacteria in the polluted soil itself (biostimulation) or by introducing hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (bioaugmentation) [<xref rid="B6-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Frequently, due to strict legislations that impede the introduction of non-indigenous microorganisms at the site of interest, bioaugmentation is implemented by the use of native strains, or strains which carry the degradative genes on plasmids which can be transferred to the indigenous population though means of natural gene transfer. Studies demonstrated how this approach is considered the best choice for bio-detoxification of soils with a low degradation potential by the indigenous bacterial communities [<xref rid="B8-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. </p><p>Undoubtedly, it is a challenge to find an effective and efficient method to remediate polluted soils [<xref rid="B10-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], especially because of the complexity and specificity of each site. Oil spillages cause profound and persistent changes in soil properties. pH may vary, as well as nutrient availability (e.g., carbon, nitrogen), with high concentrations of mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, often in combination with heavy metal pollution (nickel, lead, chromium, copper, zinc, cadmium). All these factors affect and re-shape the structure of indigenous microbial communities [<xref rid="B11-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this highly complex framework, the study and isolation of novel native ring hydroxylating bacterial strains constitutes an approach with high potential and a powerful alternative to the traditional physical and chemical remediation approaches.</p><p>In this study we combined traditional microbiological methods to isolate and characterize potential degraders from an ancient oilfield, combined with a bacterial genomic investigation aiming to reveal the genetic backgrounds of two interesting hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria belonging to the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. Our study aims to elucidate (1) the degradation pathways of linear and aromatic hydrocarbons, (2) plant growth promotion traits (hormones and stress enzyme reduction), and (3) the adaptation of the two identified <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. to life in soil, tolerance to various stresses, and extraordinary degradation capacities of micropollutants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-genes-10-00443"><title>2.

Isolation of Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacteria Using a Sandwich Diffusion System</title><p>In June 2016, we sampled the historical oilfield forest soil in B&#x000f3;brka, Poland (Latitude: 49.616449; Longitude: 21.710454; Altitude: 350.45 m). The B&#x000f3;brka sampling site is unique in the world since it has one of the oldest oil wells still in production since 1854, and still pumps one barrel a day. The black top soil layer near an oil pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00443-f001">Figure 1</xref>) was sampled with a sterilized shovel and stored in self-sealed bags. These bags were kept in temperature-controlled boxes and shipped to Hasselt University.</p><p>In the lab, one gram of soil was added into 15-mL sterile falcon tubes containing 5 mL of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.0). After vortexing, tubes were incubated for one hour on an orbital shaker at 120 rpm to allow the microorganisms to effectively being released from the soil particles. In the meantime, Teflon components, steel screws, and hydrophilic membranes of a custom-made sandwich diffusion system (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-10-00443">Figure S1</xref>) were sterilized by autoclaving (120 psi, 30 min). Each sterilized &#x0201c;perforated plate&#x0201d; was dipped into a mixture of Bushnell Haas medium [<xref rid="B13-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with 0.7% w/v Gelzan (G1910; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) supplied with 0.1% CaCl<sub>2</sub> and the soil dilution to obtain a 10<sup>-5</sup> concentration of the soil suspension. This dilution was chosen to obtain the growth of one or few bacterial cells per well. The mixture was left to solidify under a sterile laminar flow after which the membranes were placed on both sides of the agar-filled plates (WHA111103; Nucleopore&#x000ae; polycarbonate track-etched membrane; 47-mm diameter, 0.05-&#x003bc;m pore size, Whatman, Maidstone, UK). The membranes allow the exchange of nutrients and molecules from the soil to the water-agar containing bacterial cells but not the passage of bacterial cells. Finally, the sandwich diffusion systems were closed with screws and buried into the wetted soil and incubated at 20 &#x000b0;C for one month. </p><p>After one month of incubation, the sandwich systems were disassembled and each agar plug was pushed out with sterile toothpicks into a sterile deep-well masterblock filled with Bushnell Haas medium and incubated overnight at 30 &#x000b0;C on an orbital shaker.

A high percentage (60%) of the strains were able to use diesel as sole carbon source. A majority of the strains produced ACC-deaminase (53%). ACC-deaminase is an important trait of many soil and plant-associated bacteria as they can facilitate growth and development of the plant by lowering stress ethylene levels [<xref rid="B44-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. 33% of the strains produced the hormone indole-3-acetic acid. Strains producing IAA can have a phyto-stimulation effect on the host plant or pathogenic, depending on the concentration [<xref rid="B45-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Bacteria use this hormone to interact with the host plants as part of their colonization strategy and to circumvent the basal plant defence mechanisms. It can also serve as signalling molecule between bacteria. Siderophore production and organic acid production was present in 18% and 36% of the isolated strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00443-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). This can aid in the solubilization of iron and phosphorous in soil, making it more available to microbial and plant uptake. Only 6% of the strains were scored as positive for acetoin production. This ketone showed to enhance plant growth by stimulating root development and increasing resistance against pathogens and drought stress. An overview of the traits per species is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00443-f002">Figure 2</xref>C.

The 7,346,306-bp genome of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. VI4.1 (GC 60.02%) contains 8082 genes, of which 7922 are CDS, 9 are rRNAs (7, 1, 1 for 5S, 16S, and 23S, respectively), and 58 are tRNAs composed of 21 different tRNA types. The MaGe server classified 73.65% and 74.38% of the CDSs in at least one Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) for VI4T1 and VI4.1, respectively. In addition, 83.90% and 82.87% of the CDSs are classified in at least one Evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (EGGNOG) for VI4T1 and VI4.1 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-10-00443">Figure S3</xref>).

In strain VI4.1, 21 CRISPR sequences and nine transposases were found, while in VI4T1, seven CRISPRs, two Cas (CRISPR-associated), and 10 transposases were present. CRISPR, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, along with Cas are a bacterial defence system against bacteriophage predation. This all indicates that both strains have experienced extensive and complex genetic alterations and acquired new genetic elements by bacteriophages and exchanges by lateral gene transfer.</p><p>The RAST Server indicated that the most closely related strains of VI4.1 were <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> Pf0-1 (205922.3) and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp.

Because of the draft genome completeness, it is still difficult to determine whether one or two chromosomes are present, though both strains contain one plasmid: VI4T1 has a plasmid of 40,201 bp and VI4.1 one of 81,970 bp. Comparative analyses show matches of VI4T1 plasmid with a conjugative plasmid in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> pBI709 and in <italic>Pseudomonas fragi</italic> strain NMC25.

The enzymes involved are naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (<italic>nahAa-d</italic>), which hydroxylates the two-ring compound, and then <italic>cis</italic>-1;2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene-1,2-dehydrogenase (<italic>nahB</italic>) catalyses the transformation into naphthalene-1,2-diol, with oxygenation by 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase (<italic>nahC</italic>). Decisive are the actions of the isomerase (<italic>nahD</italic>) and hydratase-aldolase (<italic>nahE</italic>) to obtain salicylaldehyde further dehydrogenated by the enzyme salicylaldehyde (<italic>nahF</italic>). At this point the molecule is metabolized via the catechol cleavage pathway encoded by the lower naphthalene operon (<italic>nah2: nahGTHINLOMKJ</italic>). Salicylate monooxygenase (<italic>nahG</italic>) oxidises salicylate to catechol, and then further transformations are catalysed by the enzymes: ferredoxin (<italic>nahT</italic>), catechol-2, 3-dioxygenase (<italic>nahH</italic>), 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>nahI</italic>), hydrolase (<italic>nahN</italic>), hydratase (<italic>nahL</italic>), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>nahO</italic>), aldolase (<italic>nahM</italic>), oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (<italic>nahK</italic>), and oxalocrotonate tautomerase (<italic>nahJ</italic>). Furthermore, the typical elements of a conjugative plasmid are found such as the transfer genes (<italic>traA-D</italic>), replication site (<italic>repA</italic>), and a complete type IV secretion system (<italic>mpfABCDEFGHIJ</italic>). These latter components form the secretion machinery including the membrane proteins (VirB6, VirB8, VirB10, VirB9 and VirB7), with three ATPases that form the power unit (VirD4, VirB11, VirB4), and VirB11 and VirB4 are also required for the biogenesis of the T4S pilus. T4SS can mediate in this case the conjugative transfer of the naphthalene operon to other bacteria. Conjugation is an important strategy employed by bacteria to promote bacterial genome plasticity, and to spread a variety of functions, such as the degradation of anthropogenic toxic compounds or the detoxification of heavy metals, but also bacteriocin and toxin production to ward off predators. Having part of the degradation pathways encoded on a plasmid is an interesting property, as the strain can transfer its degradative plasmid via horizontal gene transfer to native soil or plant-associated bacteria, a strategy that has been utilised by our group to clean-up groundwater polluted with toluene and trichloroethylene.</p><p>The 40-kb pVI4T1 plasmid does not contain a naphthalene nor aromatic compound degradation operon, though it does contain partial T4SS proteins (MpfA-E), and ParA and B which are bacterial proteins involved in plasmid replication and partitioning, which suggests this was a functional conjugative plasmid but it might have lost some essential genes (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-10-00443">Figure S5</xref>). For the many CDS annotated as &#x0201c;hypothetical proteins&#x0201d;, we ran a conserved domain search and this revealed the presence of: amidase expression regulating protein, glutathione permease protein (GsiD), histidine/lysine/arginine/ornithine ABC transporter, transposases, cation efflux system (CzcD), transporters (MntH), and components involved in secretion and vesicular transport. It is a subject of speculation as to whether this plasmid is a rudimentary copy of the pVI4.1-1, or a part was not assembled; additional long-read sequencing can confirm this.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-genes-10-00443"><title>3.4.

For efficient phytoremediation activities, it is important to understand the underlying genetics structures of the many degradation pathways to better assess their activity and use in the field. In the following paragraphs we therefore focus on the bioinformatic prediction of degradation pathways of naphthalene, BTEX, and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and their experimental validation, followed by PGP prediction, motility, and emergent contaminant degradation.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that aerobic naphthalene degradation in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. can occur via (1<italic>R</italic>,2<italic>S</italic>)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol, salicylaldehyde, and salicylate, to be converted to catechol and further degraded to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates.

The 1-alkane hydrolase subunit (<italic>alkBGT</italic>) introduces molecular oxygen in the terminal carbon atom of the hydrocarbons at the expense of NADH to yield primary alcohols, and these are further catabolized by an octanol dehydrogenase (<italic>alkJ</italic>), an aldehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>alkH</italic>) and a medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (<italic>alkK</italic>). Finally, the octanoyl-CoA enters the beta-oxidation-cycle and can be utilized as a carbon and energy source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00443-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Instead of the complete <italic>AlkB</italic> operon, VI4.1 encodes a homologue of the two-domain <italic>AlkB</italic> system with rubredoxin and rubredoxin-NAD(+) reductase. Both are essential electron transfer components needed for alkane hydroxylation by AlkB. In fact, AlkB-type alkane hydroxylases fused to rubredoxin protein have been shown to hydroxylate n-alkanes with chain lengths up to C32. VI4.1 and VI4T1 also have a homolog of the cytochrome P450 CYP153 family, this is another type of alkane hydroxylase for the degradation of short- and medium-chain-length <italic>n</italic>-alkanes. Other enzymes important in aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation are the alkanesulfonate genes, of which 11 are present in VI4T1 and 15 in VI4.1. </p><p>To confirm the degradation potential, experimental evidence of aromatic hydrocarbon compound degradation was performed with PTR-TOF-MS. VI4T1 and VI4.1 were both capable of respiring 15 &#x000b5;g/L naphthalene and 3 &#x000b5;g/L each of benzene, toluene, and xylene as sole carbon source within seven days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-10-00443-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Metabolites such as salicylic acid or catechol were not identified with PTR-TOF-MS in the headspace. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-genes-10-00443"><title>3.6.

Additionally, motility allows bacteria to move away from high concentrations of toxic compounds. Bacterial motility was experimentally tested in sterile glass tubes previously filled with 869 semi-solid agar medium. Bacteria were inoculated with a straight wire to about half the depth of the medium. Tubes were incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C and observed for bacterial growth at regular intervals (one until seven days). Non-motile bacteria generally grow into the stab-line, while motile bacteria, such as strains VI4T1 and VI4.1, typically grow by differently diffusing through the medium (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-10-00443">Figure S10</xref>).</p><p>Genomic analyses confirmed the presence of genes coding for the flagellar motor complex: <italic>motA</italic>, <italic>motB</italic>, <italic>flhA</italic>, <italic>flhB</italic>, <italic>fliH</italic>, <italic>fliI</italic>, <italic>fliJ</italic>, <italic>fliO</italic>, <italic>flipP</italic>, <italic>fliQ</italic>, <italic>fliR</italic>, <italic>flgB</italic>, <italic>flgC</italic>, <italic>flgG</italic>, <italic>flgH</italic>, <italic>flgI</italic>, <italic>fliE</italic>, <italic>fliF</italic>, <italic>fligA</italic>, <italic>flgD</italic>, <italic>flgN</italic>, <italic>fliK</italic>, <italic>fliS</italic>, <italic>flgE</italic>, <italic>flgK</italic>, <italic>flgL</italic>, <italic>fliC</italic>, <italic>fliD</italic>, <italic>fliG</italic>, <italic>fliM</italic>, <italic>fliN</italic>, <italic>flgJ</italic>, <italic>flhF</italic>, and <italic>fliL</italic>.

Plant Growth Promotion Potential</title><p>In vitro tests showed that VI4T1 and VI4.1 scored positive for indole-3-acetate (IAA) production, siderophore production, acetoin, organic acid and phytate mineralization, but negative for ACC-deaminase and nitrogen fixation.</p><p>In both genomes, indole-3-acetamide hydrolase was identified converting indole-3-acetamide to IAA. This pathway is operative in several genera of plant-associated bacteria amongst which many <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B49-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Additionally, genes of the tryptophan biosynthesis gene cluster <italic>trp</italic> were present: <italic>trpD</italic>, <italic>trpG</italic>, t<italic>rpE</italic>, <italic>trpC</italic>, <italic>trpF</italic>, <italic>trpD</italic>, <italic>trpB</italic>, <italic>trpA</italic>. Strain VI4.1 has also the ability to produce IAA via an additional nitrilase-driven pathway converting indole-3-acetonitrile in IAA. The ability to produce siderophores was confirmed by the presence of the pyoverdin pathway genes, 48 genes for 4T1 and 29 for VI4.1. We found also the fundamental genes for the enzymes converting pyruvate in (R)-acetoin, with acetolactate synthase (<italic>bud</italic>B) and diacetyl reductase (<italic>bud</italic>A). Strain VI4.1 also carries the two genes responsible for the (S)-acetoin biosynthesis (<italic>bud</italic>C). The absent production of some organic acids such as citric, lactic, succinic, gluconic, itaconic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, malonic, malic, oxalic, fumaric, and lactobionic acid was confirmed after the genome annotation.</p><p>Growth and development of both, plants and bacteria require macro- and micro-nutrients, some of which are available only from external sources like the soil in which they grow. Phosphorous is such an essential macronutrient, and is usually absorbed and utilized by the plants in the form of phosphate. The role of genes as Purple Acid Phosphatases (PAPs) in strain VI4T1 has not yet been fully clarified. Experimental evidence suggests that the enzyme is induced by a lack of phosphate and excreted from bacterial cells, suggesting that it may be involved in phosphate acquisition. The presence of the gene coding for the acid phosphatase confirmed the in vitro potential of strain VI4T1 to convert a phosphate monoester in more bioavailable phosphate in the presence of water. </p><p>No enzymes were detected involved in the biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen such as <italic>nif</italic> genes or nodulation genes (<italic>nod</italic>), confirming the negative response on the nitrogen fixation test. We did not detect any homologue for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase; that outcome confirmed the results of the corresponding in vitro test. </p><p>The aminopeptidase gene (<italic>pepA</italic>) that is involved in seed germination process was detected in both genomes [<xref rid="B50-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The enzyme hydrolyses peptide bonds in tissues as the aleurone layer of the endosperm, the scutellum and the growing tissues of the seedling. The activity of these proteins is reported for several plant species. </p><p>Furthermore, both strains can synthesize jasmonic acid a member of the jasmonate class of plant hormones which is involved in the regulation of quite a number of processes as embryo and generative organs development, ageing, sex determination, seed germination, root growth, adaptation to stress factors [<xref rid="B51-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8-genes-10-00443"><title>3.8. Tolerance to Abiotic Stress</title><p>Plants are often exposed to abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, metal pollution, high salinity and acidic pH. In such circumstances, inoculating plants with stress alleviating microorganisms may offer a biological alternative to the existing agrochemicals in agriculture [<xref rid="B52-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Both strains carry the <italic>speA</italic> gene involved in the survival of the bacterium in acidic conditions via the arginine-dependent pathway, conferring potential acid resistance by exchanging external arginine for internal agmatine [<xref rid="B53-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This effectively consumes protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH. </p><p>Abiotic stress can create osmotic deficiencies in plant cells. In this context, the presence of trehalose can act as an osmoprotectant, and strains VI4T1 and VI4.1 possess several genes coding for proteins involved in trehalose anabolism, including pathway IV (trehalose synthase converting b-maltose in trehalose), and pathways VI and VII (trehalose synthase producing trehalose from ADP-alpha-D-glucose and glucose) [<xref rid="B54-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Trehalose accumulation may act as a biosurfactant and in this way enhancing the biodegradation of hexachlorocyclohexane.</p><p>Interestingly, both strains carry genes for salt tolerance including <italic>betA</italic> choline dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase (<italic>yiaY</italic>, <italic>adhA),</italic> and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>betB</italic>). Glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) is a very efficient osmolyte found in a wide range of bacteria and plants, where it is accumulated at high cytoplasmic concentrations in response to osmotic stress, to act as an osmoprotectant [<xref rid="B55-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Strains VI4T1 and VI4.1 carry genes coding for superoxide dismutases (<italic>sodB</italic>, <italic>sodM</italic>) and catalases (<italic>katE</italic>, <italic>katB</italic>) converting superoxide molecules into oxygen via hydrogen peroxide formation. Furthermore, the genomes encode for glutathione reductase (<italic>gor</italic>) converting two molecules of glutathione in glutathione disulfide with a co-production of reduced glutaredoxin. Oxidative damage to proteins often results in the formation of mixed disulfides within the polypeptides. A primary defence against this damage is mediated by the action of GSH-dependent thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, also called thioltransferases and best known as glutaredoxins (Grx). These proteins reduce the protein disulfide groups back to their native form. </p><p>Heavy metal transporters are involved in acquisition, metal absorption and detoxification. Both strains possess the genes coding for a cadmium-transporting ATPase and a copper-transporting ATPase (<italic>copA</italic>). Copper is an important element that participates in a high number of enzymatic reactions; in photorespiration, electron transport, in ethylene signalling and many other metabolic processes that have copper-containing enzymes catalysing various reactions. </p><p>Furthermore, an arsenic resistance system was detected: arsenical resistance protein ArsH; HTH ArsR-type DNA-binding domain; arsenical-resistance protein Acr3/Arsenical pump membrane protein/ArsBArsenate reductase. In addition, several cation efflux system proteins are present: cation efflux system protein (CusF), cation efflux system protein (CusA), cation efflux system protein (CusC), Cation efflux system protein (CusB). </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot9-genes-10-00443"><title>3.9. Tolerance to Micro-Pollutants and Emerging Contaminants</title><p>During the last decades, there has been an increasing concern about the presence of micro-pollutants including pharmaceutical, human health care products, medicines, endocrine disruptors, fluorinated chemicals, and microplastics that are found in the soil and waters in increasing concentrations [<xref rid="B56-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. There are 2700 such compounds listed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.</p><p>Although the novelty of these investigations translates to a lack of information in prokaryotic databases, the genome sequencing of our two <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. allows us to investigate the presence of genes involved in the degradation of endocrine disruptors. We identified in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain VI4.1 the genes androsterone 3-deydrogenase and testosterone dehydrogenase, respectively involved in the transformation of androsterone and testosterone in the common intermediate metabolite androst-4-ene-3,17-dione [<xref rid="B57-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This compound links this catabolic pathway to the one of the androstenedione degradations until mineralization via the propanoyl CoA degradation pathway I or TCA cycle. <italic>Comamonas testosterone</italic> was the first strain characterized for its capability to degrade steroids, and its capacity was compared with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. after incubation in testosterone sewage in the work of Chen et al. (2016) [<xref rid="B57-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Concerning fluorinated chemicals, strain VI4.1 carries the gene coding for the enzyme haloacetate dehalogenase, the only known enzyme that can specifically hydrolyse the carbon-fluorine bond. The enzyme was first described from a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. in 1965 and since then has been described in multiple bacterial strains. Fluorinated organic compounds have widespread applications as pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, flame-retardants, refrigerants and foam-blowing agents, and are consequently accumulating in the environment. Only a handful of carbon-fluorine bonds from biological origin are known, such as fluoroacetate, a toxin found in the leaves and seeds of a variety of tropical plants, often in high concentrations. The extreme toxicity of fluoroacetate stems from its similarity to acetate. Fluoroacetate combines with coenzyme A to form fluoroacetyl-CoA, which can substitute for acetyl CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Fluoroacetyl-CoA reacts with citrate synthase to produce 2-fluorocitrate, a metabolite of which then binds very tightly to aconitase, stopping the cycle.</p><p>Interestingly, strain VI4.1 possesses the genes terephthalate 1,2-dioxygenase (<italic>tphA</italic>) and terephthalate dihydrodiol dhydrogenase (<italic>tphA</italic>) converting terephthalate to 3,4 dihydroxybenzoate. Terephthalate is the major precursor for polyester fibres and coatings. Fibres from clothing constitute a major problem in our waterways, also polluting drinking water [<xref rid="B58-genes-10-00443" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Strains able to degrade these fibres are an important resource for the plastics recycling/upcycling industry. In relation to this, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> VI4T1 carries genes (<italic>bph</italic>A) coding for the enzyme biphenyl dioxygenase subunit A. This enzyme is involved in the first step that synthesizes 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoate and benzoate from biphenyl. Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon and an important precursor for the production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-genes-10-00443"><title>4.
