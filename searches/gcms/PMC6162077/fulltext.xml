Because of its aromatic nature, lignin has a higher energy density than polysaccharide polymers, as well as a higher potential commercial value (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). However, because of lignin&#x02019;s complexity, its efficient utilization, either as a polymer or from its derivable small-molecule products, is currently problematic (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>).</p><p>Although mild depolymerization methods, such as oxidative (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>) and hydrogenolytic (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>) procedures, have produced encouraging results in laboratory-scale experiments, their applicability in industrial processes has been limited. Direct hydrogenolysis, that is, the hydrogenation of unprocessed solid biomass by a heterogeneous metal catalyst, remains one of the most promising methods for cleaving lignin&#x02019;s ether bonds and producing aromatic monomers in high yields (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). However, hydrogenolysis still suffers from product complexity issues. In most wild-type biomass, the lignin polymer is composed of three phenylpropanoid subunits&#x02014;<italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl (<bold>H</bold>), guaiacyl (<bold>G</bold>), and syringyl (<bold>S</bold>)&#x02014;derived by combinatorial radical coupling from the three main monolignols (<italic>p</italic>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Although <bold>H</bold> units are typically at low-levels, this results in at least three different types of monomers (<bold>H</bold>, <bold>G</bold>, and <bold>S</bold>), each with a selection of side chains, as the primary hydrogenolysis products, which makes monomer separation and utilization difficult. Lignin&#x02019;s principal alkyl-aryl-ether units with their &#x003b2;&#x02013;O&#x02013;4 interunit bonds (45 to 85%) can be selectively cleaved, but other linkages including &#x003b2;&#x02013;5 (1 to 12%), &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b2; (5 to 12%), 5&#x02013;5 (1 to 9%), 4&#x02013;O&#x02013;5 (~2%), and &#x003b2;&#x02013;1 (1 to 2%), which are also present in lignins, remain largely uncleaved (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>); carbon-carbon (C&#x02013;C) and diaryl ether (4&#x02013;O&#x02013;5) units typically result from dimeric or higher oligomeric products.</p><p>The use of extracted lignins rather than whole biomass has the advantage that the material can be fully dissolved in organic solvents, facilitating catalyst recovery and continuous processing. However, acidic industrial lignin fractionation is known to cause some &#x003b2;-ether cleavage and condensation between units via the electrophilic substitution of acid-generated benzylic carbocation intermediates on the electron-rich aromatic rings (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>), limiting depolymerization yields (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S1">Scheme 1A</xref>) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). There are some elegant solutions focusing on suppressing the condensation reaction, either using a capping agent (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>) or using two-step strategies (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). However, extra chemicals or catalysts are needed to achieve this goal.</p><fig id="S1" fig-type="scheme" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title>Mechanisms for lignin condensation, C-lignin structure, and monomer M3 formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mechanism of lignin acidolysis and condensation routes.

For example, the recent use of formaldehyde protection during lignin extraction from a high-<bold>S</bold> poplar lignin (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>) that has up to 98% syringyl <bold>S</bold> units and ~90% &#x003b2;&#x02013;O&#x02013;4 linkages [from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) estimates] prevented condensation reactions and allowed an unprecedentedly high monomer yield (78%) under hydrogenolytic conditions (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). However, even in this high-<bold>S</bold> lignin, some 10% of the linkages are C&#x02013;C bonds that do not cleave. The use of formaldehyde to protect the lignin from condensation reactions also resulted in some formaldehyde addition to the ring, complicating the hydrogenolysis products with methyl-substituted aromatics. Without formaldehyde, the lignin extracted under acidic conditions had significant condensation, thwarting the production of monomers and resulting in a hydrogenolysis monomer yield of only 26% (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Although new methods for displacing formaldehyde for the protection from acid-catalyzed condensation reactions, retaining much of the yield (70%) and producing a simpler monomer mix, have recently been revealed (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>), extra protection chemicals remain necessary during the lignin extraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>An &#x0201c;ideal lignin&#x0201d; archetype</title><p>On the basis of the plethora of information stemming from the lignin biosynthetic research community over the last decade, and with the revelations regarding lignins&#x02019; structural malleability from studies on lignin pathway mutants and transgenics as well as on various &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; plants discovered to have unusual lignins, researchers have been able to contemplate designing lignins for improved utilization (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). It is now a realistic juncture to posit the characteristics for an ideal lignin archetype for biomass processing. For the depolymerization of the polymer to monomers, lignin should have at least the following three characteristics. First, if acidic pretreatment is used, then it should be stable under acidic conditions to prevent condensation and the generation of undesired new C&#x02013;C bonds. Second, it should contain only ether (C&#x02013;O) interunit linkages in its backbone so that it can be fully depolymerized. Finally, it should be generated <italic>in planta</italic> from a single phenylpropanoid monomer to allow the production of the simplest array of compounds.</p><p>We have reported the discovery of an unusual catechyl lignin (<bold>C</bold>-lignin) present in the seed coats of vanilla (<italic>Vanilla planifolia</italic>) (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>) and various members of the Cactaceae of the genus <italic>Melocactus</italic> (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>). In this special case, the lack of <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (OMT) activity for conversion from catechyl <bold>C</bold> to guaiacyl <bold>G</bold> and, subsequently, on to syringyl <bold>S</bold>, aromatic-level precursors, results in 100% <bold>C</bold> units in the cell wall (CW). This <bold>C</bold>-lignin was, somewhat surprisingly, found to be essentially a homopolymer synthesized almost purely by &#x003b2;&#x02013;O&#x02013;4 coupling of caffeyl alcohol with the growing polymer chain, producing benzodioxanes as the dominant unit in the polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). If it has particular stability toward biomass pretreatment conditions, then this <bold>C</bold>-lignin might therefore represent an example of such an ideal lignin that can, in principle, be depolymerized to a single product by hydrogenolysis. Furthermore, this substrate has the potential to produce valuable catechol monomers, whereas the large majority of monomers produced from lignin have been <bold>S</bold> or <bold>G</bold> derivatives (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Expanding the arsenal of lignin-derived platform molecules could play an important role in the successful use of this fraction within future biorefineries. Here, we describe the ideal nature of this lignin via a revised compositional characterization of the vanilla seed coat fiber, new features of the <bold>C</bold>-lignin&#x02019;s reactivity and stability, and our successful attempts at converting it to monomers in near-quantitative yields.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>NMR spectra.</title><p>Partial 2D HSQC NMR spectra of (<bold>A</bold>) EL, (<bold>B</bold>) KL, and (<bold>C</bold>) LBL from vanilla (<italic>V. planifolia</italic>) seed coat.

We therefore examined the acid stability of the polymer to determine whether acidolytic methods could be used to purify the lignin. Comparison of the two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra from the enzyme lignin (EL) (derived by removing polysaccharides via crude cellulases treatment) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>) and Klason lignin (KL) showed no significant differences in the lignin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, A and B) (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). The <bold>C</bold>-lignin survives even the harshest of acidic pretreatment methods&#x02014;the KL isolation procedure includes a 1-hour treatment in 72% (w/w) sulfuric acid, followed by dilution to 4% (w/w) sulfuric acid and autoclaving at 121&#x000b0;C for 1 hour&#x02014;while retaining its original lignin structure. An efficient acidic lithium bromide (LiBr) pretreatment method was also used to purify the lignin. This treatment method is known for its quick and near-quantitative removal of the polysaccharides to give an LiBr lignin (LBL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). The molecular weight of the LBL was shown to be similar to that of the EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The <bold>C</bold>-lignin polymer appeared to survive this pretreatment based on the retention of its key lignin structural features in its NMR spectra and little change in its molecular weight distribution. On the basis of these results, we can conclude that, unlike normal <bold>S</bold>-<bold>G</bold> lignins, polysaccharides can be removed via acid pretreatment from <bold>C</bold>-lignin without its suffering from unwanted condensation reactions. After removing the polysaccharides, the resulting lignins (EL, KL, and LBL) were completely soluble in various organic solvents [for example, acetone, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran (THF)] mixed with water to match lignin solubility parameters (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>). Efficient lignin solubilization should greatly facilitate continuous processing in an industrial setting.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Molecular weight profiles.</title><p>Molecular weight profiles of EL (cyan) and LBL (magenta) from <italic>V. planifolia</italic> seed coat measured by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC).

Although relatively low yields of the corresponding monomeric products (30 to 60%) were obtained from the dimeric compound, the use of the CW gave monomeric products in extremely low yields (&#x0003c;1%). As discussed widely in the past, both thioacidolysis and alkaline oxidation need the involvement of a free benzylic hydroxyl group on the lignin side chain (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). It was therefore concluded that, because of the stability of the 1,4-benzodioxane structure, especially under the tested acidic and alkaline oxidative conditions, traditional lignin chemical degradation methods are ineffective for the depolymerization of <bold>C</bold>-lignin. A computational approach to evaluate the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of <bold>C</bold>-lignin using density functional theory models suggested that depolymerization of <bold>C</bold>-lignin is theoretically possible (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>).

When hydrogenolysis was applied to the <bold>C</bold>-dimer <bold>D1</bold> and vanilla seed coat CW, analysis by gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) showed that the products were rather simple with dominant products <bold>M1</bold> (catechylpropanol), <bold>M2</bold> (catechylpropane), and <bold>M3</bold> (chroman-6,7-diol), together with some minor products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The major products, <bold>M1</bold> and <bold>M2</bold>, were identified by comparison with authentic synthetic standards. The initially puzzling minor product <bold>M3</bold>, which is a cyclization product from <bold>M1</bold>, was separated from the product mixture by silica-gel chromatography, characterized, and structurally identified by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). Because it was not obvious whether the chromane ring oxygen originated from the lignin &#x003b3;-OH or from water, the hydrogenolysis reaction was run in <sup>18</sup>O-labeled H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O. No <sup>18</sup>O was detected in the product <bold>M3</bold>, so the cyclization mechanism was concluded to involve the &#x003b3;-OH via a radical disproportionation reaction (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S1">Scheme 1C</xref>) (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>).

Not surprisingly, the monomer distributions were heavily affected by the choice of catalyst and solvent (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). Here, we illustrate that Pt/C showed a slightly higher reactivity, whereas Pd/C and Ru/C showed a much better product selectivity. More side chain truncation products were obtained from <bold>C</bold>-LBL compared to that from vanilla seed coat CW, suggesting that a significant degree of side chain truncation occurred during the acid pretreatment stage or that the isolated lignin was more accessible to the catalyst. In terms of solvent effects, methanol produced a slightly higher monomer yield compared to dioxane, whereas THF gave a substantially lower yield. Both monomer yield and reaction selectivity were maximized using Pd/C or Ru/C as catalyst and methanol as the solvent. Retaining or losing the hydroxy group on the side chain can be controlled by simply changing the catalyst to satisfy the different intended purposes for using the catechyl monomers. Thus, Pd/C produced the catechylpropanol monomer <bold>M1</bold> with 89% selectivity, whereas Ru/C produced the catechylpropane monomer <bold>M2</bold> with 74% selectivity. Increasing the hydrogenolysis reaction time from 3 to 15 hours (table S3, entries 16 to 19) led to an ~10% increase in lignin conversion and monomer yield. The resulting product oil mixture after vacuum drying was completely soluble in methanol, ethanol (EtOH), dioxane, pyridine, and other solvents but only partially soluble in acetone, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane (DCM) due to the presence of products from degraded polysaccharides and other non-lignin components.

The GPC molecular weight profile of the hydrogenolysis products mixture from <bold>C</bold>-LBL before and after the hydrogenolysis reactions showed a dominant monomer peak (fig. S4B). The high&#x02013;molecular weight fractions were separated from monomer fractions, and the fractions were characterized by HSQC NMR (fig. S7). The data revealed that only traces of the original benzodioxane structures from the <bold>C</bold>-lignin remained in the product and that the high&#x02013;molecular weight fractions contained only nonaromatic components present in the original sample and were therefore not from the lignin proper. It can therefore be safely concluded that essentially all of the <bold>C</bold>-lignin in the samples was depolymerized to monomeric compounds during hydrogenolysis. The non-lignin components in the lignin stream were nonextractable oils, waxes, or the other (difficult to remove) components in the sample that are not necessarily associated directly with the phenylpropanoid polymer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" disp-level="1"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Prospects for C-lignin and its derived catechylpropanoid monomers</title><p>Catechols in nature are remarkably biochemically active; because of the interaction of the vicinal phenolic hydroxyl groups, catechols play a vital role in both biomedical and biomimetic functional materials (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Their synthesis is challenging because of the difficulty of transforming phenols to catechols; although researchers have recently developed several catechol synthetic methods (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>), applying those methods at scale remains complicated. There is little reference to high-yielding biomass conversion to catechols, although catechols were reported as hydrogenolysis products from organosolv lignin of candlenut shells (using Cu-doped porous metal oxides) in which the cleaving of the aromatic methoxyl groups during the reaction was claimed (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). Catechols act as important intermediates for the conversion of lignin-derived monomers to value-added platform chemicals via the bacterial &#x003b2;-ketoadipate pathway (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>). We therefore contend that it would be beneficial, and more energy-efficient for aromatic metabolism/catabolism, if high yields of catechols could be obtained directly from lignin.</p><p>Our study provides a new perspective for the production of catechols from a renewable biomass source rather than petroleum. Compounds <bold>M1</bold> and <bold>M2</bold> are currently not available in bulk, so their commercial value is not obvious. However, an enriched diversity of the raw materials from the catechol family would likely provide significant value. A LiBr pretreatment method is able to convert a fraction of &#x003b2;&#x02013;O&#x02013;4 units in <bold>S</bold>-<bold>G</bold>&#x02013;type lignins into benzodioxanes (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>). Large amounts of catechols are potentially producible if we could produce benzodioxane-type lignins in energy crops. We do not yet know if genetically engineered plants, including plantation trees such as pines and poplars, in which the production of lignin is on a large scale, will tolerate <bold>C</bold>-lignins in stem tissues; <bold>C</bold>-polymers have been evidenced in a gymnosperm tracheary element system, in which OMT activity was down-regulated (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>), but have not yet been found in OMT&#x02013;down-regulated dicots, and we suspect that additional activities will need to be suppressed for the synthesis and deposition of the <bold>C</bold>-lignin polymer. Given the unique acid-resistant property of <bold>C</bold>-lignin, the potential value of the monomeric products, the homogeneous nature of <bold>C</bold>-lignins that is already known to aid lignin fiber production (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>), and the high conversion to catechol monomers by hydrogenolysis reported here, we suggest that continuing to pursue the means to produce <bold>C</bold>-lignins in planta is decidedly worthwhile.</p><p><bold>C</bold>-lignin therefore has numerous compelling features for a biorefinery operation aimed at delivering value from its lignin component. It maintains its native structure after treatment under even strongly acidic conditions; acid pretreatment can therefore be applied to vanilla seed coats to recover the polysaccharide while retaining the native <bold>C</bold>-lignin structure. After sufficient pulverization followed by acid pretreatment, <bold>C</bold>-lignin could be dissolved in organic solvents, enabling both detailed NMR analysis and continuous processing schemes. <bold>C</bold>-lignin can be completely depolymerized by a hydrogenolytic method to produce simple monomeric catechols near-quantitatively and, by selecting the catalyst, with a single monomer accounting for 90% of the monomer product. The yield and selectivity for a single monomer are higher than for any other lignin or biomass to date (fig. S6). There is therefore considerable potential for economic hydrogenolysis of <bold>C</bold>-lignin&#x02013;rich waste biomass resources only now being structurally characterized, such as Jatropha (<italic>Jatropha curcas</italic>) seed coats (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>) and candlenut (<italic>Aleurites moluccanus</italic>) shells (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>), and via genetic engineering if high levels of <bold>C</bold>-lignin could be expressed in traditional biomass sources. Such an approach toward significantly valorizing lignins and biomass in biorefining processes would aid process economics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>C-lignin sample pretreatment</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Processing of seed coat material</title><p>Vanilla seed and pod were received as a mixture from a natural vanilla processing plant (Bakto Flavors LLC).

It is difficult to quantify native lignin with <sup>13</sup>C NMR for two reasons. One is the poor solubility of lignin, and the other is the overlapping peaks from the lignin side chain with polysaccharide peaks. However, <bold>C</bold>-LBL is a perfect sample for <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis. First, the lignin structure is simple; there is only one type of structure in the lignin backbone&#x02014;the benzodioxane derived from &#x003b2;&#x02013;O&#x02013;4-coupling. The chemical shifts of the benzodioxane carbons are unique (75 to 80 ppm), so that there is little chance of signal overlap with other components. Second, <bold>C</bold>-lignin is acid-resistant. Unlike the <bold>S</bold>-<bold>G</bold>&#x02013;type lignins, harsh acid pretreatment can be applied to <bold>C</bold>-lignin without destroying the benzodioxane structure. Thus, we can easily remove the polysaccharides by acid pretreatment, further minimizing the signal overlap problem. According to the 2D HSQC spectrum of <bold>C</bold>-lignin (fig. S1), C&#x003b1; and C&#x003b2; have the potential to allow <sup>13</sup>C NMR quantification of the phenylpropanoid unit derived from caffeyl alcohol in the <bold>C</bold>-lignin (fig. S2). C&#x003b3; cannot be used for the quantification because of the signal overlap with the unknown peaks (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub>, 4.00 to 4.35 ppm; &#x003b4;<sub>C</sub>, 60.0 to 62.5 ppm). The aromatic region of <bold>C</bold>-lignin cannot be used for the quantification because of the overlap with signals from protein residues (tyrosine and phenylalanine) (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>). C&#x003b1; and C&#x003b2; may seem equally good for the <bold>C</bold>-lignin quantification; however, when looking at the HSQC spectrum at a lower contour level, peaks from polysaccharide residues cannot be completely ignored even after the acidic LiBr pretreatment; the residual C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>5</sub> of the cellulose overlap with the C&#x003b2; of the <bold>C</bold>-lignin.

The GPC conditions here were slightly different from those in the analytical GPC method. For the fractionation, dioxane was used as the mobile phase instead of 0.1 M DMF/LiBr solution at a slower flow rate (0.3 ml/min) to achieve better fractionation. Four fractions were separated and collected (fig. S7A). The ultraviolet (UV) absorption contour map showed that different molecular weight fractions had completely different UV absorption properties. Because of peak overlap, each fraction was characterized by using its 2D HSQC NMR spectra and subtracting the overlapped fractions&#x02019; spectra (fig. S7, B to E; note that f2 was characterized by subtracting f1 and f3 from f2, f3 was characterized by subtracting f2 and f4 from f3, and f4 was characterized by subtracting f3 from f4]. As seen in the NMR spectra, peaks from some nonaromatic components appear in all fractions (f1 to f4). The molecular weight of these nonaromatic components cannot be measured accurately because of the low GPC resolution and peak tailing, and/or the possibility that these nonaromatic components have a wide molecular weight distribution. Fractions f1 and f2 were almost identical to each other and contained only traces of aromatic peaks. The highest molecular weight component(s) in the product mixture was therefore not from lignin but from other components in the seeds. Fraction f3 contained the major hydrogenolysis products <bold>M1</bold> and <bold>M3</bold>. This fraction exhibited the strongest UV absorption in the UV contour map, which means that it was the dominant aromatic-containing mixture in the product. Fraction f4 was the other major hydrogenolysis product <bold>M2</bold>, which has a slightly lower molecular weight compared with <bold>M1</bold> and <bold>M3</bold>. It is inferred that there was a large amount of high&#x02013;molecular weight products (the products in f1 and f2), which are distributed from f1 to f4 because of peak overlap. As these products lack aromatic rings, they are not from the caffeyl alcohol&#x02013;derived phenylpropanoid polymer. Thus, they must be produced from other components existing in the seed, such as waxes, fatty acids, etc. These observations support our conclusion that the lignin content of vanilla seed coats is not determined accurately by KL and other traditional lignin analytical methods because of these nonextractable, nonaromatic components.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>TOC analysis</title><p>A TOC analyzer (TOC-VCPH, Shimadzu Co.) with a solid sample module (SSM-5000A, Shimadzu Co.) was used to determine the total carbon content of the vanilla seed coat material and its hydrogenolysis products, its fractions, and the nonvolatile products. The hydrogenolysis products were dried at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min to remove EtOH and then dried at 50&#x000b0;C in a vacuum oven for 30 min to completely remove water and EtOH. The dried solid samples (20.00 &#x000b1; 1.00 mg) and hydrogenolysis products were measured as solids.</p><p>Using LBL as a hydrogenolysis feedstock and dioxane/water as the solvent, there was no significant change in the carbon content before (62.66 &#x000b1; 0.23 wt %) and after (61.64 &#x000b1; 0.34 wt %) the reaction (&#x000b1;SD, <italic>n</italic> = 2). Solvent degradation products (for example, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, etc.) were detected in the product mixture and identified by GC-MS when dioxane was used as solvent. It is still possible that some components in the <bold>C</bold>-LBL can either become volatile or attach to the catalyst. However, considering that the volatile products (for example, methane, ethane, and hexane) have much higher carbon contents (~75 to 85 wt %) compared with the solvent degradation products (~35 to 45 wt %), the loss of volatile products while introducing solvent degradation products should cause a significant decrease of carbon content. In our experiment, we did not observe any carbon content decrease nor did we observe any weight increase of the catalyst. This result suggested that the loss of volatile products during work-up and the effect of the solvent degradation products were negligible and also implied that most of the carbon-containing compounds were retained in the product mixture.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Synthetic model compounds and compound authentication</title><p>Synthetic methods are fully described in the Supplementary Materials.</p></sec></sec>
