This is a new Github repository for a project and article to be submitted to Beilstein J. Org. Chem.

Everything is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science. The creator of the philosophy, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Bradley , described it as

```
... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook that is freely available and indexed on common search engines. 
It does not necessarily have to look like a paper notebook but it is essential that all of the information 
available to the researchers to make their conclusions is equally available to the rest of the world
```
J-C also used the term: "no insider knowledge" - there should not be knowledge that only people in the project know. 
Here is my eulogy: https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2014/05/19/jean-claude-bradley-hero-of-open-notebook-science-it-must-become-the-central-way-of-doing-science/
