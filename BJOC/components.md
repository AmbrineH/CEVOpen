Components of the hypermanuscript.
==================================

A list of the major sections. Some may have subsections. Not clear yet whether
the subsections are listed here or in the section info.

Philosophy of the hyperarticle
------------------------------

[Philosophy](philosophy.md) This article is
[Opennotebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) with the
philosophy:

-   all material is created in public view and immediately (e.g. several commits
    a day) visible on the Open web.

-   the Github `git` system records all versions and earler versions can be
    recalled at any time.

-   there is no centre (`git` is a distributed system and authors can create
    branches ("forks"). However the formal manuscript is coordinated into
    snapshots for the publications process

-   all material is re-usable for any purpose. See: [Open
    Definition](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Definition)

Because this is a complete and ongoing record of everything, there will be many
"errors" â€” missing components, broken and incomplete components and factually
"wrong" material. In the Open ethos (e.g. Wiikpedia or Wikidata), the response
should not be *"that's rubbish"*, but *"how can I help correct or enhance the
current version"*. First-time authors will be contributing and they will benefit
from a constructive response. OpenNotebook when properly carried out can have a
*higher* quality of content as reserachers/authors are conscious that the world
is watching everything.

Structure of this hyperarticle
------------------------------

This article represent a research process which is dynamic in space and time. It
started before the formal submission of the article and has no end time. It's
continuing at variable pace and could last for years. It also involves authors
from several countries who can drop in and out when they wish.

Locations and technology used
-----------------------------

The document is almost exclusively hosted on Github. The "definitive" version is
on [http://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen](http://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen ) but
work has been located on (\@caffiendFrog ... please fill in).

### Markup

The "manuscript text" has been authored in (Github) Markdown - which is widely
known and requires no software. It's also possible to convert this to other
formats such as DOCX, HTML, etc. A final "version" can be assembled whenever
required [HT Alf Eaton: We haven't yet got this working]. Markup supports
sections, lists, tables, images, references, hyperlinks.
