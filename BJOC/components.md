# Components of the hypermanuscript.

A list of the major sections. Some may have subsections. Not clear yet whether the subsections are listed here or 
in the section info.

## philosophy of the hyperarticle
[Philosophy](philosophy.md) 
This article is [Opennotebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) with the philosophy:
* all material is created in public view and immediately (e.g. several commits a day) visible on the Open web.
* the Github `git` system records all versions and earler versions can be recalled at any time.
* there is no centre (`git` is a distributed system and authors can create branches ("forks"). However the formal manuscript is
coordinated into snapshots for the publications process
* all material is re-usable for any purpose see [Open Definition](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Definition) 

Because this is a complete and ongoing record of everything there will be many "errors" - missing components, broken and incomplete 
components and factually "wrong" material. In the Open ethos (e.g. Wiikpedia or Wikidata) the response should not be "that's rubbish",
but "how can I help correct or enhance the current version". There are several first-time authors and they will benefit from a constructive
response. OpenNotebook when properly carried out can have a *higher* quality of content as reserachers/authors are conscious that the world 
is watching everything.


## structure of this hyperarticle

This article represent a research process which is dynamic in space and time. It started before the formal submission of the article 
and has no end time. It's continuing at variable pace and could last for years. It also involves authors from several countries who 
can drop in and out when they wish.
