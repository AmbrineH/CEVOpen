[I am writing]  a paper for Mat Todd's special issue on Medicinal Chemistry.
https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/series/98
Mat developed Open NoteBookScience for malaria and so our work on EssoilDB and the new venture into extracting skin 
related indications for plant extracts would fit brilliantly. (I have written to him).
I will write the paper. 
Over 11 years EssoildDB1.0 has used the scientific literature to create a unique overview of the essential oil output from a wide range of plants investigated for biological activity. we have recently cleaned and normalized this and made it semantic by linking to online authorities. Here we report a new semantic tool for phytochemical medical discovery consisting of
- a dictionary (1839) of plants known to produce essential oils and rooted in accepted taxonomy
- a dictionary (2112) of unique compounds  in essential oils, with specific and generic identification (InChI) and lined to global authorities (PubChem, ChEBI, Wikidata)
- a dictionary of terms for specific diseases (e.g. of the skin) again linked to authorities (ICD-10, Wikidata)
- automatic creation of  queries from dictionaries and search of EPMC
- downloading thousands of potentiallly relevant articles
- secondary search to find precisely those articles with plants, oils, compounds
- extraction of tables of oil composition and their activities.
We have applied this to (say) a subset of 1000 articles related to essential oils and skin.

The authorship would be:
Gita Yadav
Emanual Faria
Ambarish Kumar
Manish 
Vinita Lamba
Shruthi-M
PMR

[] will go ahead today and build the system that Manny and I will use to search
EPMC for essential oils and acne. Since this is ONS we don't have to have any formal chemical / medicinal results - this would be 
a methodology paper and give snapshots of what we find. 

Ambarish is doing a good and essential job on normalising the compounds (nearly finished) and will report their frequency.
