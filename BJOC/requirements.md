Organic Chemistry drives the discovery of molecules that have the potential to transform global health. New synthetic 
and analytical methods promise significant improvements in the speed of this discovery and the quality of any resulting 
pharmaceuticals. In parallel it is now understood that i) improved sharing of data and ideas can radically improve our 
ability to discover and develop medicines and ii) the scientific community will greatly benefit if its work can be 
machine-readable, so as to harness creative ideas from new methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

This special issue focuses on breakthrough new scientific methods in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery, with a theme 
of how the sharing of open data can increase the impact of the research.

The Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry is an international, peer-reviewed, Open Access journal that publishes 
research articles on all aspects of organic chemistry, including organic synthesis, organic reactions, natural 
product chemistry, structural investigations, supramolecular chemistry and chemical biology. Manuscripts 
submitted to the Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry should fall within the scope of the journal and meet 
Beilstein's publication criteria: high quality, originality, novelty and importance. The publication of 
scientific articles is free of charge, as the Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry is completely funded by the Beilstein-Institut.

Please ensure that you have gathered all relevant information and that your manuscript is prepared according
